The town became one mass\\nOf people, crowding, anxious eyed, to take\\nA last look\\xe2\\x80\\x94-little dreaming \\'twas the last\\nBurke, on his sturdy bush horse leads the van\\nOf that adventurous band, pledged mutually\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nOne to the other, and, within, us deeply\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nEach man to his own soul. They go to explore\\nThe vast unknown Australian continent,\\nFrom southern rivers and abodes of men\\nNorthward to Carpentaria\\'s homeless Gulf\\nOr die,\\xe2\\x80\\x94with dying hopes advancing still\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nTo the last famish\\'d man, and his unconquer\\'d will.\\nThey journey on, week after weary week,\\nThrough ways impassable, as Nature thought\\nWhen first she cast these deserts from her hand,\\nUnsuitable for life. But manhood, rare\\nIn energy and fortitude, improves\\nIts Maker\\'s gifts, \\'till, hardening to the work,\\nThe shaggy matted wilderness is cloven,\\nAnd opes her thorny breast to let them pass.\\nThe camel pauses o\\'er the gorge\\'s brink,\\nWith obstinate nostril and averted stare,\\nBut downward his uncouth machinery\\nIs led with skill, beneath its toppling pack,\\nO\\'er jagged rock and slippery boulder stone,\\nUntil, once more, his dingy fabric rises\\nInto the scorching splendours of tho noon.\\nResting sometimes by day, all night they march,\\nMeasuring their course beneath the constellated arch.\\nMonth treads on month, dangers and pangs are borne,\\nOf scanty water\\xe2\\x80\\x94oft with none at all\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nTen fold more terrible than hunger\\'s fangs.\\nAnd thus undaunted, do they force a way,\\nThrough salt-bush wastes, box-forest, mallee scrub,\\nO\\'er rugged deserts of the torn-up rocks,\\nHills, long ravine and gorge, black earthy plains\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nDarkening the eye to the horizon\\'s verge,\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nLoose and unsafe, with many a treacherous crack,\\nDeep as the shoulder of a stumbling horse,\\nGrey mud-plains, hard and pale as pumice-stone,\\nBoundless, and ghastly, with unnatural light,\\nWhere the mirage presents clear pools and lakes.\\n(To one who lags behind, or gets astray),\\nAnd men and camels of the Exploring Train\\nTravelling along the necromantic sky,\\nAnother Train, inverted, foot to feet,\\nTravelling beneath : both shadows!\\xe2\\x80\\x94-and all else\\nOf the reality, then invisible !\\nSaw\\'st thou yon Horseman, journeying thro\\' the sky !\\nI was Burke, the Leader!\\xe2\\x80\\x94oh, that desert prophecy!\\nOnward they plod, and struggle without pause,\\nSave for their measured sleep, and measured meal;\\nAnd in the centre of Australia\\'s wastes\\nThe foremost party stands. The Leader here\\nSelects three men, with him prepared to plunge\\nInto the wilderness, as yet untrodden\\nBy human foot, and scarce by foot of beast\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nE\\'en the wild dog. The carrion bird here paused\\nOn prudent wing, nor left the Great Creek\\'s bounds;\\nBut onward moved the men. The rest encamped,\\nRemain with stores to solace their return.\\nAgain the weeks creep on with these four men\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nThe leader, Burke, young Wills, with King and Grey\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nTheir life a constant toil, and nothing else,\\nSave one sustaining hope, their rest oft marred\\nBy pestilent clouds of gnats, horn\\'d beetles, ants,\\nMarsupial mice and rats and, worse than all,\\nThe ceaseless torment of the common fly\\nAttacking mouth, eyes, skin, by day and night.\\nSo scorching is the heat, the natural course\\nOf social habits now must be reversed\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nBreakfasts by moonlight, suppers in the sun\\nAmidst his earliest rays. Red sandy plains,\\nAnd hills that seem to bake before they blaze,\\nMust now be traversed. Thence, the different toils\\nOf the Great Stony Desert\\xe2\\x80\\x94hideous miles\\nOn miles more hideous .But, ere long, the scene\\nGrows verdurous : creek after creek appears,\\nGreat parks and forests, chains of water-holes\\nFull of bright fish; rich grass and pasture lands.\\nHere is no barren desert, as\\'t was thought,\\nBut a new region for laborious hands !\\nThus on they fare, prairies and plains, each seeming\\nBoundless as oceans, by these resolute men\\nWith devious steps, at length, are over-passed\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nThey reach the tidal influence of the Gulf\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nThe Continent is crossed ! What joy is theirs!\\nWhat triumph of the soul, and the full heart!\\nWhat sense of the Great Victories of Peace,\\nWhich shall bring good-will among distant men !\\nWith beaming and exultant eyes they gaze\\nOn glittering swamps, and chains of reedy pools\\nMade rich with floating stars of many a flower;\\nMarshes of grassy emerald, streak\\'d with gold\\nOr touched with flashes of the rising sun,\\nLengthening lagoons tufted with islets; brave\\nIn flags and ferns, or mossy rooks and shrubs,\\nWhere colonies of wild fowl swim around;\\nWhile overhead, in the cerulean sky,\\nFlocks of white pigeons gambol, poise, and flash,\\nAnd in the distance, \\'midst these watery lands,\\nGrave pelicans on sandy reaches stand,\\nFlapping the showery arches of their wings,\\nAs if in welcome, while the herons scream,\\nLike music to the ear of victory.\\n*Nothing of what is understood as imaginative poetry is offered\\nin the above story, which is simply on attempt to condense the\\nwhole narrative, divested of all its prose details and technicalities,\\nand to give a few touches of local scenery.\\nBurke dips his hands within the tidal flow;\\nWills also\\xe2\\x80\\x94King and Grey. Oh, freshening life\\nWhere Hope perceives her long-watched, leafless tree,\\nSuddenly fruitful in the wilderness !\\nAll wade into the streams, to make truth sure,\\nAnd the one chosen horse (Burke\\'s. \" Billy \") dips\\nHis nose, eye-deep, in the ecstatic flood,\\nAnd drinks as if he never could be full ;\\nThen sighs and snorts, and pricks his ears, and stares,\\nAnd tries to understand the common joy\\nWhich yet he with his master shares. But Burke\\nAll raptures soon controls. Brief time to pause\\nFor rest on the inhospitable shore\\nOf their success. Hunger will drive them back\\nIn less space than they came\\xe2\\x80\\x94perhaps destroy.\\nAlready Death has visited this band\\nOf spirits heroic. Those who formed the rear\\nJourneying towards Cooper\\'s Creek, camped at Bulloo,\\n\\'Midst hostile blacks, with fever and disease,\\nWere still too sick to follow ; man and beast.\\nOne, staggering. said, \" Let me now shoe the camels,\\nLest I should die before that duty\\'s done.\"\\nHe shod them, and then died. Another lay\\nProstrate in body, with a teeming brain.\\nWandering \\'tween Science and Delirium,\\nWith Art to weep his epitaph. So passed\\nThy spirit, Ludwig Becker,\\xe2\\x80\\x94cast away\\nBy the \" ignorant present,\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94scarcely named\\xe2\\x80\\x94and soon\\nForgotten, like a common clod. O, shame !\\nO, sorrow ! and the more of both, because\\nHis wrong is buried with him. Others died,\\nOf no note; noted equally,\\xe2\\x80\\x94and all\\nIn the same list with the lost quadrupeds.\\nMeantime the Leader and his chosen three\\nReturn to join their friends on Cooper\\'s Creek,\\nCentral in this vast continent. Sore tried\\nBy ravening hunger, and with failing limbs\\nOnward they gasping press, each stop a pang,\\nBeneath a sun that burns within the shade,\\nWhenever shade is found ; and through the night\\nAching, and well-nigh paralysed with cold,\\nThey still urge on, for life hangs in the hours,\\nMorn toiling after morn as t\\'were the last,\\nYet still another claiming equal toll,\\nAnd more, from their lost strength. Severely urged\\nThe camels sweat with fury and with fear,\\nBleeding and groaning \\'neath their galling packs.\\nThe store of food fast fails. One camel now\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nAnd now a snake they eat, whereby, it seemed,\\nBurke sickened, as did Grey ; and Grey succumbed,\\nFrom the intolerable suffering of the march\\nThus forced by want, and down he sank, like one\\nSo craving rest, he had no thought beyond ;\\nNor of his last words have we any note,\\nNor of the spot where lie his mouldering bones.\\nThe Leader still, with Wills and King, holds as\\nDragging his wasted and exhausted form\\nBy energy of will, and only fed\\nWith confidence in succour waiting them\\nAt the great Central Creek. There they will find\\nFood, clothing, sleep, congratulating friends,\\nAnd heavenly rest of limbs, midst tears of joy.\\nThe goal, so achingly desired, at last is reached\\nBy these three worn-down, yet victorious men\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nAnd all is vacancy !\\xe2\\x80\\x94the camp broken up !\\nDeserted\\xe2\\x80\\x94man and beast !\\xe2\\x80\\x94their friends are gone\\nNot one remains !. A scored tree-trunk imparts\\nThe dreadful truth\\xe2\\x80\\x94the blank dismaying news !\\nThe heart-depressing strait that few foresaw,\\nYet all should have foreseen as possible,\\nAnd all with care forestalled. That very morn\\nTheir friends departed, thinking them all dead,\\nAnd fearing a like fate, their homeward course had sped.\\nBurke, Wills, and King, each wasted to the bone\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nExhausted, and in rags\\xe2\\x80\\x94their camels sick\\nOnly one horse\\xe2\\x80\\x94Burke\\'s \" Billy\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94with them still\\nNow face their fate. And thus the Leader spake\\nTo Wills and King : \" Can you our friends o\\'ertake,\\nWho for Menindie started with the dawn ?\"\\nBoth shake their heads--\" We cannot.\" \" Nor can I\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nTo ask you \\'twas my duty. Now must we,\\nEach with his load of food upon his back,\\nGather\\'d from scraps left buried here, strive hard\\nTo reach the Southern settlements.\" The others\\nCounsel conciliation of the blacks,\\nStill on the Creek. o\\'ersway\\'d in this, they rise,\\nAnd for Mount Hopeless plod their anguish\\'d way.\\nTow\\'rd Adelaide their thoughts still gravitate,\\nTill the last camel in a quagmire sinks\\nHe dies, and he is eaten ; but fierce thirst\\nAssailing\\xe2\\x80\\x94their way lost\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Mount, a myth,\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nThey must retrace their steps to Cooper\\'s Creek.\\nThey reach it, feebler than before ; but soon\\nThe last scraps left there, finish\\'d, once again\\nTo find Mount Hopeless they move forth. They move,\\nAs moves the dial\\'s shade, these shades of mam :\\nNo substance left\\xe2\\x80\\x94no food. And now the horse,\\nDrooping from thirst, with nose that scrapes the ground,\\nSinks on his knees,\\xe2\\x80\\x94and, dying, he is killed,\\nAnd his dried flesh will aid them to return.\\nAlas ! poor horse ! thou did\\'st thy duty well ;\\nDrank\\'st of the stream from Carpentaria,\\nAnd, like to some who once in life were blest,\\nSaw Paradise, and yet died miserably.\\nAgain they falter back upon the Creek,\\nLiving, yet feeling death in every limb,\\nIn every joint, nerve\\xe2\\x80\\x94almost in the heart.\\nThey pitch a tent, and having got some fish\\nFrom native blacks who lurked about the place,\\nPrepare to cook it ; but the tent takes fire\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nThey are too feeble \\'gainst both wind and flames,\\nAnd all their last few stores are soon consumed.\\nKing soothes the hostile blacks, and thus obtains\\nThe native seed, to pound between two stones ;\\nIts flour, like stone-dust, making ruthless bread.\\nSearching for seed, and grinding it for food\\nExtinguishes their final flickering strength,\\nAnd Wills lies down with a calm smile, to die,\\nExhorting them to leave him there alone.\\nAnd seek the blacks for aid. The Leader\\'s heart\\nResists, but by young Wills at length o\\'erruled,\\nThey leave him, placing near within his reach\\nNardoo and water for the next eight days, .\\nWhen they\\'ll return. Bidding farewell, none weep ;\\nAnd one shall find him there\\xe2\\x80\\x94in his heroic sleep.\\nBurke now, and King, creep slowly along the Creek.\\nThe blacks are gone. There is no chance of life,\\nUnless they\\'re found : but, like the desert crow,\\nOr the wild dog, once gone, \\'tis rare for man\\nOf the white races to discover them\\nThe two creep forward with bewilder\\'d brain,\\nWhence comes a dreadful hour of secret pangs\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nA silent, mental struggle, which shall die ?\\nOr which die first. Nature soon closes this.\\nThe Leader throws away his sickening swag\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nMakes his last supper on a carrion bird,\\nShot and prepared by King with tenderest care\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nAnd thus his last will speaks. \" I shall but hold\\nA few hours more, good King. Take this\\xe2\\x80\\x94and this.--\\nIf you survive, deliver them. Do not go,\\nTill I am quite dead : \\'tis some consolation\\nTo have a friend near. While I am dying, place\\nThis weapon in my right hand\\xe2\\x80\\x94and then leave me,\\nUnburied, as I lie.\" Through that dark night,\\nThe Leader, slowly dying, held his peace.\\nWhat thoughts were his\\xe2\\x80\\x94memories\\xe2\\x80\\x94affections fond\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nSad visions of high fame, had he returned\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nNone but his Maker knew. But once he sigh\\'d\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nAt day-break speechless\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and at sunrise dead\\nOne ragged, starving man, drooping o\\'er that grand head.\\nTHE WORLD PROGRESSES BY ITS MARTYR\\'D MEN\\nLet none deplore the means whereby it moves\\nTo higher knowledge and to larger acts ;\\nBut the great sorrow o\\'er these noble bones,\\nAfter their victory, springs from the thought\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nHow little foresight would have saved their lives !\\nBlame lies on more than one ; but no complaint\\nThe Leader breathed ;\\xe2\\x80\\x94he knew his work was done,\\nAnd, reconciled to fate, desired to leave\\nHis bones to whiten for his monument :\\nHaving s0 long the frightful desert faced,\\nHe would lie stark, and arm\\'d to face it still.\\nHe met Death hand to hand, nor felt the sting\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nA skeleton of man, bow\\'d to God\\'s skeleton King!\\nNoble delirium of a faithful brain,\\nWhich Homer, or grey Ossian might approve;\\nWhile Christians equally will recognise\\nA spirit steadfast\\xe2\\x80\\x94-true to the last pulse\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nPledg\\'d to the path of Duty.

To those who are apprised of Doc-\\ntor Halloran\\'s long experience as a teacher, and of\\nthe number of persons now filling eminent situations\\nwho were educated by him, it will scarcely be neces-\\nsary to say, that his pupils\\' acquirements, in the short\\nperiod during which they have studied under his di-\\nrections, appeared highly creditable to themselves\\nand to their instructor. Handsome silver medals, of\\nconsiderable value, were presented to Masters Henry\\nRobinson and John Wild, with the following short\\nbut apposite address :\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n\" Masters Henry Robinson and John Wild,\\n\" I have much pleasure in presenting to each of\\nyou this honorary mark of distinction, in testimony\\nof my approbation of your endeavours to improve in\\nyour various studies. Your success on this occasion,\\nfar from relaxing those endeavours, I confide will prove\\nan animating incentive to increased exertion on your\\npart; and will excite also a spirit of laudable emula-\\ntion in the breasts of your fellow students.\\xe2\\x80\\x94 I congra-\\ntulate each of you on your present acquisition ; and\\nwould entreat you to remember, and attend to, these\\nwords of an elegant Latin poet (to whose acquaintance\\nI hope ere long to introduce you), \\' Macte nova vir-\\ntute, Puer.\\'\"\\nSimilar medals were obtained at Christmas last by\\nMasters Simeon Lord and Robert Campbell.\\nIt must be highly gratifying to all who are aware of\\nthe vital importance of education to the interests of\\nsociety, to know, not only that such an establishment\\nas Dr. Halloran\\'s is open to the youth of this Colony,\\nbut also that it receives the fostering attention and\\npatronage of those, under whose auspices, it may\\nfairly be hoped, the benefits which it offers will be\\nmore extensively communicated.\\nFrom a recently received English paper we copy the\\nfollowing Account of the Foundation of the Great\\nStone of the Sheerness Docks :\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n\" The first stone of the stupendous dry docks erect-\\ning at Sheerness dock-yard was yesterday laid by Com-\\nmissioner the Honorable Courtenay Boyle, amidst an\\nassembled multitude of workmen, masons, labourers,\\npile-drivers, convicts, and others. I happened to be\\npresent, and such things, you know, only sometimes\\nhappen even to a sentimental traveller.\\n\" The extent of this prodigious and praiseworthy un-\\ndertaking seems to be little known to the public; and\\nwell might the Secretary of the Admiralty, upon a re-\\ncent occasion in the House of Commons, invite the\\ngentlemen questioning the utility of these works to a\\npersonal inspection : it is indeed from a personal in-\\nspection alone, that the extent, utility, durability, and\\nmagnificence of the undertaking can be properly ap-\\npreciated. The first stone was laid with all the cere-\\nmony usual upon such occasions : some of the various\\ncoins at present in circulation, with a parchment label\\ndenoting the date, &c. were enclosed in a bottle, and\\nfirst lodged under the great stone, which itself was of\\nprodigious weight, and is 3 feet high on its edge on the\\nground ; so that, independent of the vast foundation,\\nthe three docks (each capable of receiving a first-rate)\\nare to be surrounded by 3 feet in thickness of massy\\ngranite. Besides the Honorable Courtenay Boyle, the\\nCommissioner of the dock-yard, there were present to\\nwitness the ceremony, the Right Honorable the Earl of\\nCork (the Commissioner\\'s brother), Colonel Prowse,\\nColonel Daubency, of the 31st and 84th regiments,\\nCaptain Brown, and all the officers of the Royal En-\\ngineers, &c.\\n\"The Royal standard was hoisted, the stone sus-\\npended with proper tackle, and 3 times 3 of hearty\\ncheering proclaimed the lodgment of what no mortal\\neye now in existence will, in all human probability, ever\\nsee removed.\\n\" The worthy Commissioner expressed his satisfac-\\ntion at the conduct of all concerned in this great work,\\nand hoped that Mr. Thomas, the resident engineer and\\nsuperintendent, might live to witness the completion of\\nhis labour, and enjoy the fair fame attached to his me-\\nritorious exertions. The Commissioner, in alluding to\\nthe officers under his immediate direction, was addressed\\nby one of them in something like the following terms,\\nwhich, as if furnishes a kind of history or view of the\\nworks and proved rather interesting at the time, I, like\\na true traveller, committed to paper upon my return to\\nthe inn, and now forward for your amusement and in-\\nformation :\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Sir, said the officer alluded to, it is quite\\nimpossible for the persons surrounding you who have\\nwitnessed the ceremony of laying the first stone of this\\nstupendous undertaking, not to be impressed with\\nmingled emotions of pride, wonder, admiration, and\\ngratitude \\xe2\\x80\\x94 pride at the country\\'s capability to prose\\ncute such a work ; wonder and admiration at the art\\nand labour of man which has brought it thus forward ;\\nand gratitude to the Giver of all good, who has so\\nwonderfully aided man\\'s efforts by rendering the sea\\nsubservient to the barriers erected for its exclusion. If,\\nSir, we look around us, in every direction we behold\\nmatter for praise and wonder: here we see a wall 2000\\nfeet in length, projected into the bosom of the sea;\\nthere we view the stupendous sides of a magnificent\\nbasin, superb arches of stone, capacious tunnels, im-\\nmense pillars of granite rearing their heads all around\\nus; in another place we behold mounds and mountains\\nof mud, moving with facility as it were by magic, under\\nthe influence of railways, steam engines, horse runs,\\nand barrows. If we consider what this place was, con-\\ntrasted with what it even now is, and contemplate what\\nit will be, we are indeed lost in admiration, and equally\\nunable, with the philosopher of old, to reflect on the\\nfirst stroke of a pickaxe, as it relates to the final forma-\\ntion of a pyramid, without the most pleasing emotions ;\\nor can we view this stone without considering that on it\\nmay rest the prow of many a first-rate ship, which from\\nthe facilities afforded by these great works when com-\\npleted, may in a few days be sent from these docks to\\nbear the British thunder to the shore of any future\\nproud or insulting foe (loud cheering). Here, on this\\nvery spot where we now stand, but a few months since\\noozed the soft mud of Sheppey, unequal to the burthen\\nof man ; and we now tread it, a firm and solid founda-\\ntion: and if we think how this foundation has been\\nformed \\xe2\\x80\\x94 first, by importing whole forests from Ox-\\nfordshire, Berkshire, and the surrounding counties,\\ntransposing their once towering tops to the depth of 40\\nfeet below the surface of the earth; next covering\\ntheir upset ends with fields of brick from Essex, and\\nbinders of timber from Russia ; surmounting the whole\\nwith quarries of granite from Scotland, Cornwall, and\\nYorkshire \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we must consider the ponderous prospect\\nbefore us with astonishment. No man reviewing these\\nworks could question their utility, or cavil at their ex-\\npence. That they are needful, will be advantageous,\\nand no prodigal expenditure permitted, is the highest\\ngratification to every man of integrity, and true lover of\\nhis country ; these works, the greatest now in Europe,\\nwill pass to posterity with due applause the names of\\ntheir projector, planner, executor, purveyor, and super-\\nintendent of the latter, Mr. Thomas : indeed, it might\\nappear fulsome to speak upon the present occasion and\\nin his presence; yet to lose such an occasion would be\\nthe height of ingratitude : it is sufficient to say, that\\nthe integrity which guides, the urbanity that governs,\\nand the kindness that upon all occasions distinguishes\\nthe conduct of the honorable and amiable superinten-\\ndant of these great works, merits and meets support\\nfrom principle ; to follow his example is to do our duty\\nto our country ; and to obey his commands, the plea-\\nsure and the pride of all around him.\\n\" As an humble individual connected with these\\nworks, aware of their durability to the utmost extent\\nthat human labour, exertion, ingenuity, and skill can\\ndevise or accomplish, I can only express my best hope,\\nand feel pursuaded I shall be joined by my surrounding\\nfriends, that this happy country may last in honor, and\\nrise in glory, as long as the dock at Sheerness can float\\na ship, or Old England furnish such heroes by land and\\nsea as have hitherto, and ever will defend us.\" (Loud\\ncheering and applause from all present).\\nCRIMEA.\\xe2\\x80\\x94 A new sect of Christians, deviating from\\nthe Greek church, has sprung up in the south-eastern\\nparts of the Russian empire, and a curious rescript\\nhas been issued by the Emperor Alexander, contain-\\ning directions for its treatment. We know nothing of\\nthe tenets of these Christians, except that it is intima-\\nted that they resemble the Pauliciens of the 8th centu-\\nry, of whom an account may be found in Gibbon.\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nWe may infer, therefore, that they approach to the\\nProtestant churches now established in Europe. The\\ncourse prescribed by the Emperor Alexander, touch-\\ning these sectaries, though more humane, Certainly\\nreminds us of Trajan\\'s celebrated letter to Pliny. The\\nsimilarity has also struck the continental editors, who\\nrefer to the passage, which we here subjoin :\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n\" They are not to be sought for ; but if they are\\ndenounced and convicted, they are to be punished :\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nyet so, that whoever shall deny himself to be a Chris-\\ntian, and shall have given proof of it by worshipping\\nour Gods, though he may have been suspected in time\\npast, shall obtain pardon from his repentance.\"\\nThe Russian converts to the new faith are said to\\nhave been already driven from their homes, and placed\\nin an insulated situation, in order to prevent prosely-\\ntism. They are called Duchoboozi ; and the rescript,\\nwhich is addressed to the Military Governor of Cher-\\nson, is to the following effect :\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n\" The sect having been removed from the Ukraine\\nto the circle of Melitsholks, in the Tauris, in conse-\\nquence of the blameable way of life imputed to them,\\nand to prevent their opinions from spreading, the Go-\\nvernor is directed to consider the motives of this remo-\\nval, which is said view at once to protect the sect from\\nimproper mortifications, and to stop the spreading of\\ntheir opinions ; and the Government, not having re-\\nceived for many years any complaints from one side or\\nthe other, or other reports of disorders, had every\\nreason to suppose that the measures adopted were\\nsufficient.\\n\" The departure of this sect from the true faith of\\nthe Greco-Russian church is stated to be a deviation\\nfounded on some erroneous representations of the true\\nworship, and of the spirit of Christianity ; but as they\\nare not without religion \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for they seek for what is di-\\nvine, though not with a right understanding \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it does\\nnot become a Christian Government to employ harsh\\nand cruel means, torture, exile, &c. to bring back to\\nthe bosom of the church those who have gone astray.\\nThe doctrine of the Redeemer, who came into the\\nworld to save the sinner, cannot, it is said, be spread\\nby constraint and punishment ; cannot serve for the\\noppression of those who are to be led back into the\\npaths of truth. All the measures of severity ex-\\nhausted upon the Duchoboosi in the course of 30 years,\\nhave not been able to extirpate this sect, and have\\nonly increased the number of its adherents. They\\nare, therefore, in future to be protected from unme-\\nrited insults on account of the difference of their faith.\\nBy being removed to another settlement they would\\nbe again placed in a hard situation, and be punished\\non a mere complaint, without examination.\\n\" The colony is therefore recommended to the spe-\\ncial superintendence and particular care of the Gover-\\nnor, who, without regarding false allegations or pre-\\nconceived opinions, is to examine into all the local\\ncircumstances, their way of life, their conduct, and\\ntake care of them, as an impartial Governor who stu-\\ndies the good of those who are confided to his care.\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nThe fate of these settlers must be permanently se-\\ncured ; they must feel that they are under the protec-\\ntion of the laws: and then, but not before, His Im-\\nperial Majesty says, we may expect from them attach-\\nment and love to the Magistrates.\\xe2\\x80\\x94 But it is added, if\\nthese sectaries seek to draw away others from the Es-\\ntablished church, and to injure them with their own\\nreligious notions, then the energy of the law must be\\nexerted against such violators of it, and such illegal\\nconduct must be checked. But even then it is not al-\\nlowable, that, on account of one or more criminals\\nwho are convicted of a violation of the law, the whole\\ncolony, which has had no share in it, should be made\\nresponsible. Such complaints and accusations require\\na careful examination, from whom the complaint\\ncomes, and what may be the motives of it. Thus the\\ntwo Duchoboozi named in your representation, who\\nafter their return to the true church, accused this so-\\nciety of various transgressions, and deposed to their\\nblameable way of life, may have done this out of ma-\\nlice or revenge; perhaps they were excluded from the\\nsociety for crimes, or deserted from a contentious and\\ninimical spirit. Such mere complaints, which de-\\nserve altogether no attention, must never induce the\\nadoption of severe measures, which may he followed\\nby the arrest, imprisonment and torture of those who\\nare not yet convicted of any bad intention, or any\\ncrime.\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Calcutta Journal.\\nLATITUDE OF TREES IN SWEDEN:\\xe2\\x80\\x94 From researches\\nmade in Sweden on the different kinds of wood indi-\\ngenous to the country, it has been ascertained that the\\nbirch reaches the farthest north, growing beyond the\\n70th degree; the pine reaches to the 69th; the fir\\ntree to the 68th ; the osir, willow, aspien, and quince,\\nto the 66th ; the cherry and apple tree to the 62d ;\\nthe oak to the 60th ; and the beech to the 57th ; while\\nthe lime tree, ash, elm, poplar, and walnut, are only to\\nbe found in Scania.'\n",

      " \"To the PRINTER of SYDNEY GAZETTE.\\nSIR,\\nHaving once had the pleasure of an intimate\\nacquaintance with a person of some eminence in\\nthe literary world, I the day before yesterday laid\\nmy hand by accident upon the rough copy of a\\nfew verses in his own hand writing, descriptive of\\np rt of the sufferings of an unfortunate Debtor, the\\nactual poverty of whose circumstances placed him\\nbeyond the hope of evermore emerging from the\\nvale of wretchedness, unless charity should inter-\\npose its aid, of which, however, the complainant\\nappears not to be very lavish in his expectation.\\nTo introduce any opinion on the subject of\\nDebtor and Creditor, I neither design nor wish,\\nnor do I intend to offer any strictures upon the lit-\\ntlee extempore piece itself further than that the sub-\\nject suits unfortunately with every time and every\\ncountry; and that I am seriously of opinion, that\\nif many Creditors were sensible of the sufferings\\nendured by the generality of imprisoned Debtors,\\nwe should often feel gratified in the contemplation\\nof acts of generosity. I have in my time known\\na Creditor to pay weekly alimony to a man im-\\nprisoned fora trifling sum, and to keep the priso-\\nner locked up until his groats exceeded considera-\\nbly the sum itself, although he was certain all the\\nwhile that the unfortunate man had nothing but\\nhis groats to live upon, and the very menus adopted\\nfor enforcing payment, were far more certain to re-\\nmove the possibility of compliance. The motive\\nfor imprisoning a man under such circumstances I\\ncould not help questioning upon several considera-\\ntions; the first, whether the Plaintiff could enter-\\ntain a hope of benefitting by his confinement ; and\\nthis I knew to be impossible, for the poor fellow\\nwas friendless and forlorn ; and, unable to answer\\nsome trivial demands incidental to a first introduc-\\ntion into these mansions of distress, had been\\nobliged to dispose of part of his apparel to answer\\nthe exigency. The consideration that came next\\nunder view was, the inducement to pay a certain\\nweekly allowance under a certainty that\\nno part of it could be ever re-imburscd ;\\nand the inference that naturally followed was\\neither that the plaintiff had more money than he\\nknew what to do with; and might certainly have\\napplied any superabundance to a more charitable\\npurpose ; or, that he was a profound simpleton\\nto send out his money upon so unprofitable an er-\\nrand ; or, but surely no man could be so unfeeling\\n--a fixed resentment had taken root against a\\npoor miserable fellow to whom he had given a\\ncertain small credit which had not been satisfied ;\\nand that personal vengeance was, in truth the\\nend proposed. To delight in spinning out the\\nmiseries of a fellow creature, and to derive\\ngratification from the protraction of his suffer-\\nings, is not, as I consider, doing as a man would\\nwish to be done by, and consequently is a breach\\nof the Divine Law, an offence to our blessed\\nReligion ; and, if considered also in a moral or\\nan immoral point of view, little further observation\\nneed be offered than that it is too prominent a fea-\\nture of turpitude to admit of avowal :--but I beg\\npardon for the unintended length of my introduc-\\ntion, and now leave you to the little Extempore\\nitself.\\nThe Poor Debtor.\\nBy fortune discarded--a prison my doom,\\nAh ! why do I sadly survive,\\nBut to end an existence, mayhap in this tomb\\nThat's prepared for the wretch while alive.\\nIf a brother in durance hail freedom's return,\\nTo transport my heart doth incline ;\\nBut transient's the joy-with impatience I burn,\\nAnd I wish the same blessing were mine.\\nNow hope grows too feeble my spirits,to chear ;\\nReflection consoles me no more,\\nFor thought but informs me my lot is severe\\nThat I live but new ills to endure.\\nFrom whom shall the debtor immur'd beg relief:\\nOr who his misfortunes befriend,\\nWhen the wants of his children but add to his grief,\\nAnd their tears they unheeded expend ?\\nYe generous few, who can kindly bestow\\nA mite on the suffering poor,\\nCompassionate this my sad story of woe,\\nAnd to Liberty open the door.\\nOr if by mishap be unheeded my pray'r,\\nAnd I sink beneath usage unkind,\\nThe grave puts an end to all miseries here\\nAnd in death a true friend shall I find.\\nSHIP NEWS. -- On Sunday last the Spring Grove\\nreturned to Port, and sailed again on Tuesday\\nfor the whale fishery.\\nRemain, with His Majesty's armed tender Lady\\nNelson, and colonial schooner Estramina, the\\nFavorite and Active brigantines, both ready for\\nSea.\"\n",

It was nothing that a grant of\\nland was made to him at the interposition of his English\\nfriends, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that a house was built and a garden planted for\\nbis use. Ho wept bitter tears; for he was naturally\\nafraid that his new riches would make him an object of\\nhatred to his countrymen. He took back many valuable\\npossessions and some knowledge. But he was originally\\none of the common people; and ho soon saw, although\\nhe was not sensible of It at first, that without rank he\\ncould obtain no authority. Ho forgot this, when he wss\\naway from the people with whom he was to ond his days ;\\nbut he seemed to feel that he should be insecure when\\nhis protector, Cook, had left their shores. He divided\\nhis presents with the chiefs; and the great navigator\\nthreatened them with his vengeance if Oraai wss\\nmolested. The reluctance of this man to return to hii\\noriginal condition was principally derived from these\\nconsiderations, which were to him of a strictly personal\\nnature. Tho picture which Cowper has drawn of the\\nfeelings of Omai is very beautiful, and in great part true\\nas applied to him as an individual ; but it is not true of\\ntho mass of savages. The habits amidst which they are\\nborn may be modified by an intercourse with civlliied\\nmen, but they cannot bo eradicated.'\"\n",

As far\\nbaot as thc year 1826 he saved the life of a little boy\\nai Leith. The little fellow fell into the harbour, and\\nwas with great difficult; extricated, as there was a\\ngreat depth of mud where he fell. The next life that\\nhe saved was that of a lady-also at Leith-who fell\\nfrom the gangway in leaving a steamboat. We next\\nfind him saving lifo in this colony-lie saved the lifo\\nof Mr. Samuel Bayley, or East Maitland, who was\\nknocked overboard from the steamer Victoria by a large\\nsea off Nobby\\'s. Captain Patterson waa guided to\\nhim by the sea gulls hovering over him as he was\\nfloating in the water. In 184*2 he saved a man named\\nWinter, who jumped overboard from the Bose, steamer,\\ntwenty miles from Sydney. Tn 1843 he saved all\\nhands, ten in number, from a schooner which was run\\nover in a dense fog by the Rose steamboat. He also\\nsaved the lifo of Mr. Pitt, of East Maitland, who fell\\nfrom the gangway in leaving the Rose steamer ; also\\nthe lifo of the Kev. Mr, Bolton, who also fell from the\\ngangway. In the year 1864 he\\'saved thc crew of tho\\nPatterson Packet, which capsized in a heavy thunder\\nsqnall off Broken Bar. In 1853 the brig Deva wont\\nashore on the Oyster Bank : the lifeboat went to her\\nand got swamped. Captain Patterson swam off with\\naline to her, and succeeded in getting the lifeboats and\\nall hands on shore, with thc exception of one man\\nnamed Long Dick, who was drowned. In 1854 he\\nsaved tho life of a man named Lanogan, who foll from\\nthe ganaway of the Ben Bolt steamer. In 1858 he\\nsaved the life of Mr. O\\'Brien, who fell from the gang-\\nway of the Patterson steamboat. The following is\\npart of an extract from the Herald in the year 1854 :\\n\" The Sydney Griffiths barque, from Melbourne, in\\nattempting to enter the harbour on the evening of the\\n23id instant, missed stajs, and went ashore on the\\nOyster Bank. Captain Griffiths ordered his boats on\\nimmediately for help, and the pilot boat manned by\\nvolunteers (the orew having deserted), with the steamer\\nBen Bolt, started to her assistance, when, after consi*\\nderable difficulty and danger, Captain Patterson suc-\\nceeded in getting her off and towing her into port.\\nThe ship docs not appear to have sustained much\\ndamage, and her safety is chiefly, if not entirely, to be\\nattributed to the able assistance of the Ben Bolt and\\nher energetic commander.\" He also saved the life of\\nMrs. Sutcliffe, who fell from the Sophia Jane, at Mor-\\npeth. She was five minutes in the water before rescued.\\nThis was in the year 1839. Numerous other instances\\ncould be enumerated, but the foregoing will be suffi-\\ncient to shew that if any Ono deserves a gold medal for I\\nsaving life, Captain Patterson is the man. Besides 1\\nthc foregoing instances in which Captain Patterson i\\nhas saved life may be added the following, which !\\nCaptain Patterson made ut acquainted with. On tho\\n24th of May, in the year 1888. a man was smoking\\nrats out of a vessel\\'s hold in Sydnoy, when he became\\nnearly suffocated, and must inevitably have perished\\nbut for Captain Patterson, who descended into the\\nship\\'s hold, and at the imminent risk of his own life,\\nsaved that of a fellow-creature from a most dreadful\\ndeath. On reaching the deck of tho vessel the resoued\\nmnn was nearly dead, and Captain Patterson himself\\nwas in a very exhausted state,-Newcastle Chronicle.\\nA DWELLES IN int CAVE.-An extraordinary caso\\ncame before tho Sunderland magistrates en the 18th.\\nA pitman named Thomas Robson was summoned for\\nrefusing to quit a cave he had hollowed oat for his\\noccupation in tbeeoa bank\\xc2\\xbb, on tho lands of the Eccle-\\nsiastical Commissioners, who wero the summoning\\nparties. Their only objeot woe to Induce Robson to\\nquit \"the premises;\" but neither threats or.persuasion\\ncould succeed.\\' It transpired, during the hearing of the\\ncase, that the defendant took it into his Heid to leave\\nhis employment at Ryhope Ojllerv, and the honie he\\noccupied, for the purp\\'se of excavating a habitation ont\\nof the sea banks. Be made himself a nice entrance ant\\nout a room of considerable size, and made a holoat the\\ntop for a chimney.

The eave was about half\\nway up the bank, and about forty feet from the beach,\\nand was approached by a winding path.

Tho plaintiff\\'B declaration put tho case in\\ntwo ways, first, that the creek had been wilfully polluted\\nby tho casting of coal therein ; secondly, that tho damiegti\\nhad been the result of ncgltgenco. Tho defendants had\\npleaded-first, a general doninl that thej- had dono any\\ninjury to tho plaintiff ; secondly, that whatever injury had\\nbeen inflicted lind been the unavoid.iblo result of what thoy\\nhad done in the lawful conduct of their businoss as coal\\nlumera.\\nSir William Manning, Q.C., Mr. Darloy, and Mr. Salo-\\nmons, instructed by Mr. Maguire, appeared for the plaintiff;\\nand Mr.,Butlor, instructed by Messrs. Allen, Bowden, and\\nAllen, for the defendants.\\nTho plaintiff was the lessee of Spring G rovo, a farm of\\nfifty acres, at Fairy Meadow, Wollongong district,\\nin the vicinity pf the Mount Pleasant Colliery. His\\ncase was that a small stream of water which ran through\\nhis and other lands in that neighbourhood had been ren-\\ndered unfit for uso bj- tho deposit of n largo quantity of\\nslocOc coal from the collierj\\' in question, ana that his farm\\nhad boen otherwise injured from the samo cause. Tho\\ndefendants\\' caso was that there had been no such injury,\\nand that although the creek might have boon partially fillod\\nup by slack coal, this had not been the result of any care\\nlossnoss on tho part of tho emploj-ccs at the colliery, but of\\nn land slip, the result of a flood, for which tho defendants\\nwere not responsible. The evidenco was very voluminous,\\nand in\\'many respects very conflicting. Tho amount really\\nin question was a small one, but tho object of tho contest\\nwas rather, it would appear, to determine tho genorol ques-\\ntion whether or not tho proprietors of cool mines in that\\ndistrict were to be held responsible for damages of this cha-\\nracter. According to the plaintiff and his witnesses the\\ncreek had clearly been damaged by the presence of a\\nquantity of slack coal which hod como down from an\\nimmense henp noar the mouth of the mine-a result bl ought\\nabout by the carelessness of the minors in allowing bo vast\\nan accumulation at such a place. Tho supply of water from\\nthis creek had previously been regular ana abundant. Tho\\nwater, although a littlo hard for washing purposes, hail\\nbeen excellent for every other kind of domestic use, but\\nsince the conl had come down it had been quito useloss.\\nTho waterholes had boen completely filled up, so that the\\nconstancy of tho supplj- of water was to it great extent put\\nan end to, and such as was still to bo had was very bad.\\nThe flood, too, bad carried tho slack coal over some of tho\\ncultivated land, and hod destroj-cd or damaged tho crops.\\nCook had about forty head of cattle which had boen accus-\\ntomed to drink at this stream, but which could\\nnow scarcely use ii. He had boon compelled\\ntherefore to sink a well. Ho had offered to toke \\xc2\\xa320\\nin full compensation for these injuries, and for this sum to\\nclear out the bed of tho creek himself, but tho defendants\\nhad refused lo give him that amount and had offered only\\n\\xc2\\xa310. According to tho defendant\\xc2\\xab\\' wltnosses the water of\\nthis creek, which had always been a littlo brackish,.had\\nbeen in no way injured by tie influx of slack coal, which\\nwas far less than had been represented, and was occasioned\\nsolely by a landslip during a flood which hod brought down\\nat the samo time a largo quantity of soil. The spread of\\nslack coal over tho land to a small extent had rather a\\ntendency to increaso its productiveness than otherwise, and\\ntho catUo had in no way suffered. The^offer of \\xc2\\xa310 had\\nbeen tendered, it was sworn, without prejudico-that is to\\nsay without admitting any liability-and only in tho hope\\nby dealing liberally with tho plaintiff to save all trouble and\\nexpense. Samples of tho water from . this\\ncreek were exhibited in Court, whioh sample\\xc2\\xab\\npresented a very uninviting appearance. It was contended\\ntint they had not been fairly token, but that the water must\\nhavo been btorcd up, but this was denied. Some of this water\\nwas analysed by Mr. Watt, from whose evidence it would\\nappear that its\" foulness aid not in all probability result\\nfrom tho presence of coal, but from that of organic matter.\\nIt further appeared that watcrcrcsscs wore growing plen-\\ntifully in the creek, and that decomposed vegetable matter\\nmight in dry weather help to make the water bad. Tho\\nwater of the creek, according to Mr. Watt, was naturally\\nbrackish, and tho slack coal from this\\'mino when settled\\n(as it. would, settle) ,at. tho bottom of theiBtreain when\\n\\' \\'net flowing rapidly- would\\'\\xc2\\xab not pollute it as alleged.\\nThere was nirtfccr evidence that a stream of water coming\\n.ut of the same seam of coal was quite pure, and was con-\\nstantly used for domestic purposes. Seme of the coal was\\nbroken up in Court and placed in tumblers ef water, upon\\nwhich it left a slight scum, although without otherwiso\\nrendering the water apparently impure. The impurity, J\\nhowever, va\\xc2\\xab most positively \\xc2\\xabvom to by the plaintiff\\'\\xc2\\xab *\\n**\"?\"-~-i _.\\n.witnosBcs. Somo evidence was gone into on the part of tho\\nI ?\\'_.nti(T lo show that tho lond-slip, if it did canso tho dam-\\nage (which was denied), lind been the result of some mis-\\nmanagement of tho excavation. This was mot by direct\\ncontradiction on tho(pnrt of tho defendants. Tho ovidenco\\nwas directly contradictory na to the quantity of slack coal\\nin tbo heap nenr the colliery, and in nearly ovcry other im-\\nportant particular, even \\xc2\\xa1is to tho local features of tho\\ngi omul.\\nHis IIokoh directed the jury that the plain ques-\\ntion for their deteniiiuation was whothor or not tho\\nplaintiff hnd mndo ont any claim to damages for\\ninjurj\" sustained by him through any want oi duo core on\\ntho p\\'nrt of tho defendants\\' employes.

IN MIND,\\nwhen disease undermines the health, and the physical\\nsystem has become prostrated, a stimulant that will not only\\nstrengthen, but remove the c*use, should be immediately resorted\\nto. Mental distress is also a fruitful source of the break\\'ing down\\nof the constitution, and the ravages of this enemy to health are\\ntruly alarming. For all such maladies,\\nHOSTETTER\\'S STOMACH BITTERS\\nhave been found unsurpassed. By acting directly upon the\\ndigestive organs, they remove the heavy, disagreeable fcelinj\\natter eating, so often complained of by persons of a delicate tem-\\nperament. As soon as digestion is restored, the patient finds hil\\nstrength increasing, and his general health improved.\\nThousands of persons certify that it may be relied on in all\\ncases of weakness or nervous debility attendant upon sedentary\\nhabits. The generality of Bitters are so disagreeablo to the taste\\nthat they are objectionable to a weak stomach. This is not the\\ncase with Hostetter\\'s Bitters, whioh will be found mild, and\\nextremely pleasant. Balsamic barks, plants, and roots contribute\\ntheir restorative juices to render it soothing and strenc-thening.\\nIts basis is the only pure stimulant which has over been produced,\\ncontaining no fusil oil, or any other deleterious element. The\\nmost careful and skilful chemists have analysed the bitters, and\\npronounce them harmless. This is scientific testimony ; hut the\\ntestimony of the hundreds of thousands who have experienced the\\npreventive and curative effects of the GREAT VEGETABLE\\nTONIC and ALTERATIVE of modern times is still moro con-\\nclusive. In Fever and Ague. Dyspepsia, Billiousness, Nervous\\nComplaints, Chronic Complaints, and general debility, it Is as\\nnearly infallible as anything in this fallible world can be.\\nWholesale Agents, ELLIOTT, BROTHERS,\\nHO and 112, Pitt-street, Sydney.\\nHOLLOWAY\\'S OINTMENT. - Be Comforted\\nNothing is more distressing to the mother or well-disposed\\nnurse than to see a child rendered feverish and restless by the\\nskin affections attending infancy.

      " 'NEW ZEALAND.\\nNOTES ON PASSING EVENTS.\\n[KItOM OUU OVWX COWIES I-ONDKNT.)\\nAUOKT.AXJ), 20th January.\\nTin; news from lho East Coast is hy no means\\nso good Ihis last week. At Opotiki, there is a\\nreturn of a stale of filings which is very far from\\npleasant in the recommencement of hostilities\\nby (he natives in the line of murdering any\\nEuropean or loyal native they can catch. All\\nalong they were of course ripe for this, if the\\nopportunity had been considered favourable, and\\nthe fact that for a considerable time nothing of\\nthe sort was tried went to show that they were\\ndeterred by fear from the course. They have,\\nit appears, entered upon it again, and this, more\\nthan anything of more decided want of success\\nto our troops or loss to our men, is the real bad-\\nness of the news.\\nThe Auckland papers are a little too much\\naffected hy it, I think, and seem to lay stress\\nupon it as if it involved the loss of prestige, and\\nthe undoing of work supposed to be done\\nalready; but \\'there is no good ground for sup-\\nposing that any change at all affecting the\\nultimate position of the campaign has taken\\nplace.\\nColonel Lyon, who commands at Opotiki,\\nhas, I believe, already taken measures to\\nrepress the forward movement of the rebels,\\nand a short time will, 1 have no doubt, see\\nthem driven back once more to their fastnesses\\nwhere they were to have been attacked some\\nweeks ago-a course which, if taken, would, no\\ndoubt, have put a stop to the present evils.\\nAlthough a good many ambushes have been\\nset by the rebels, we only know of one victim\\nhaving been secured-a Maori of the native\\ncontingent, named Johnson, who was toma-\\nhawked and brutally hacked to pieces. There\\nare more than suspicions entertained regarding\\nthe position of many of the natives professedly ,\\nfriendly in the district. No doubt, many arc\\ntraitors, but that is not so remarkable as the\\nreadiness with which we seem always to trust\\nthese people again.\\nLower down the coast the last stronghold of\\none section of the natives seems to have fallen\\nto our attack with but trifling loss ; and we may\\nnow consider that, with the exception of the\\nforce at Opotiki, which is a conglomerate of a\\ngood many sections of rebels,-there is now no\\nfear of a formidable resistance being offered to\\nour aims on the East Coast. Of course, it is true\\nthat these people arc very easily moved from\\nplace to place, and a little vigour displayed at\\nOpotiki rntiy soon cause the re-appearance of\\n\\xc3\\xadcbcls at Turanga-mii or at Waiapu. This, in\\nfact, is a main difficulty of our position, and one\\nnot easy to provide against but by constant care\\nand watchfulness.\\nOn the \"West Coast, at \"Wanganui, it is grati-\\nfying to find that something vigorous is at last\\nbeing done. The operations of General Chute\\nhave not been characterised by any startling\\ndisplay of military science or of original genius,\\nbut they have been vigorous and well-timed,\\nand as such have produced better effects than\\nmany more correctly planned operations would\\nhove done.\\nThe loss of another field officer in Colonel\\nHassard, of the 57th, is a great pity, as the\\nofficers hare been very heavy sufferers already\\nin comparison with the men in this war. How-\\never, the moral effect on the natives of finding\\nIle soldiers able to storm pas off-hand and\\nfollow them boldly into the bush will be excel-\\nlent indeed. To the colonist, too, it is no small\\ngratification to find that the troops are to have\\ntile chance before they go to remove the re-\\nproach which was made against them of being\\nafiaid of the bush and of native forts. It is no\\npleasant position for people of British race at\\nany time to hear sims cast upon the good name\\nof the British aimy, of which they arc proud\\nalmost by instinct. A little beating will be\\nenough for the AVaneanui natives, for they arc\\na chicken-hearted race, too cruel to be really\\nbrave, and so esteemed even by their own\\npeople.\\n1 hope General Chute may see their submis-\\nsion complete before the troops are all with-\\ndrawn from the colony.\\nIn my account of my experiences of the\\nnorthern part of this island (which is the result\\nof a careful personal inquiry into the facts), your\\nreaders will have learned most of the local facts\\nof interest al present.\\nThe discovery of a fine vein* of copper at the\\nlower Thames, in the neighbourhood of the\\nplace where gold has been found in payable\\nquantities, but inaccessible, owing to native\\njealousy, is a fact of some importance.\\nCopper has been known to exist for some\\ntime in the neighbourhood, and the\\nproprietor (native) of the land is quite willing\\nto have it worked. It is said that there is a\\ngood deal of the silver with the copper, which\\nwill of course enhance the importance of the\\ndiscovery, if correct.\\nI am informed that a cominmy, with a capital\\nof \\xc2\\xa320,000, is in course of formation to work\\nthe New Zealand flax on the plan discovered by\\nMr. Purchas, some of which was in the Sydney\\nmaiket previous to the Avar, and commanded\\nexcellent prices. The present effort promises\\nwell, as some of the best names in Auckland are\\nconcerned.\\nAUCKLAND, 2\\'Jlh January.\\nTo-day is the twenty-seventh Anniversary of\\nthe founding of this colony, and all Auckland is\\nholiday-making in consequence. The weather\\nseems not to have proved particularly favour\\ni able to the regatta, which is our way of holding\\nhigh festival here on this occasion each year,\\nI and the absence of the old Maori element to a\\ngreat extent from the scene lakes much from\\nthe romance of the affair. Formerly\\nit was the Maori festival j.ar excellence,\\nbut for the last two years the natives\\nhave not been on sufficiently cordial terms,\\nexcepting to the North-and the Northern\\nnatives never did much in canoe-racing-to come\\nin any considerable numbers to the regatta.\\nWere the Northern tribes removed or unfriendly\\nwe should soon be much in the position of the\\nAustralian cities, where an aboriginal native is a\\ncomparatively rare sight.\\nThe position of matters on the West Coast is\\nveiy greatly improved by the operations \"of the\\ntroops under General Chute. In a former\\nletter I gave some details of his earlier\\noperations in taking the pas at Manu\\ntaki and Manapawa, where Colonel Has\\nsard, of the 57th, was unfortunately mor-\\ntally] wounded. These successful operations\\nwere, however, only preliminary to his larger\\nscheme, which he has now, in great measure,\\naccomplished. That was to penetrate from\\nWanganui to Taranaki by an inland route, and\\nto take all the fortifications, and destroy all the\\nhouses and plantations he could find on the\\nway. Starting with about 750 men in all, of\\nwhom about 500 were her Majesty\\'s troops,\\nand 250 colonial forces, either natives or Forest\\nBangers, he forced his way through serious\\ndifficulties of all sorts, the chief of which was.\\nthe want of food, which was moro than once\\nvery seriously felt, to the extent of obliging the\\ntroops to eat horse-flesh, as tho commissariat\\nJ\\xc2\\xbb\\nfe \"*- -*\\ncould.not keep up with them. On the march\\nabout ten days seem to have been consumed\\'\\nand it is stated that in the various fights that\\noccurred on the route not less than 150 natives\\nwere killed. Every fortified place was assaulted\\nand taken by storm, on the principle established\\nby the colonial forces on the East Coast, and in\\nall cases the defenders of the pas seem to have\\nbeen panic struck at the apparition of soldiers\\nactually rushing a pa before a single shot had\\nbeen fired at it from the traditional great guns.\\nGeneral Chute had reached New Plymouth at\\nour latest dates, and had been received with the\\ngreatest possible enthusiasm, which displayed\\nitself in the form ol triumphal arches and ad-\\ndresses.\\nThe General\\'s work, however, is not yet done\\nby any means. This march indeed is but the\\nfirst blow, which must be followed up with\\nothers in rapid succession, unless it is to be\\nforgotten. He is quite aware of this happily,\\nand is about to recommence his march back\\nagain, only taking the coast line instead of the\\ninland route.\\nAt Warca, near the Patia Uiver, and on the\\nwonderfully fertile plateau that stretche3 away\\nsouthwards from the base of Mount Egmont,\\nthere is reason to believe that the natives will\\nbe found in very considerable force, and with\\nformidable works of defence. The country is\\ndifficult, owing to the heavy scrub of manuka\\nand flax which occupies most of the district\\nand the natives are so fully competent to take\\'\\nadvantage of this that it may safely be said\\nthat the heaviest part of the work is yet to\\ncome.\\nA continuance of the same fearless tactics\\nwill, however, in the opinion of every compe-\\ntent judge, lead to the complete and early\\nsuccess of the operations at Warca as elsewhere,\\nand loo much credit can scarcely be given to\\'\\nGeneral Chute for the ready and able way in\\nwhich he lias adopted and applied to regular\\nmilitary practice the lessons to be learnt from\\nthe experience of the colonial forces.\\nThe native contingent on the East Coast has\\nbeen gaining fresh laurels, and the rebels we\\nmay hope have been gaining new experiences\\nwithin the last few days. The rebels who were\\ndefeated so often by the combined native and\\ncolonial forces under Major Frazer, retreated on\\nthe difficult country at the head of the river \\'\\nWairoa, where in the very inaccessible district\\nround the Waikarcmoana Lake, where the river\\ntakes its rise, they considered themselves safe\\nfrom molestation. Such was not the view of\\neither Major Frazer or the friendly chiefs who\\nfollowed them up with about 400 fighting-men.\\nOn the 11th and 12th days of this month a\\nsevere scries of skirmishes were fought close to\\nthe banks of this large and romantic lake\\nwhere the rebels had erected a pa of some\\nstrength. The struggle seems to have been\\nsevere, and the arts of the defending party were\\nso clever that it seems hard that they\\nshould have proved so ineffectual. On the\\nsecond day the victory of our men was so well\\nestablished that the rebels, having lost their pa,\\ntook to their canoes, and favoured by the fine\\nweather-in windy weather the lake is too\\nstormy for ennocs-made their escape, leaving\\nforty-one dead bodies behind them. Many, no\\ndoubt, were wounded in the affair on their side,\\nas thirteen were on ours. The greatest chief of\\nthe Wairoa was left dead by the rebels, as well\\nas five or six men of leading rank. Amongst\\nthe loyal dead (twelve) there were no men of\\nnote ; but old lhaka, a great chief and warrior,\\nwho was, in fact, commander-in-chief, was\\nrather badly wounded in the thigh.\\nThere is no news of further fighting at\\nOpotiki, but some may be daily expected. The\\nescape of some fifty-three native prisoners from\\nthe hulk at Wellington, effected hythe removal\\nof a port and dropping into the water or a boat\\non a stormy night has caused some sensation.\\nThe principle of keeping these men shut up in a\\nhulk doing nothing beyond eating and sleeping\\nhas long been condemned by the colonists, and\\nthis second escape may perhaps stir up the\\nGovernor to consent to some more reasonable\\nplan. They were offered to Otago as hard-labour\\nmen, it may be remembered, bul the offer was\\nnot accepted owing to a mistaken notion that\\nthe chiefs would not work. The old proposal to\\ndeport them to the Chatham. Islands\\nseems better than allowing the poor wretches to\\nmake their escape and lose a large percentage\\nby drowning in the attempt-no less than six\\nout of the fifty-three arc known to have lost\\ntheir lives.\\n\\'Hie confiscation of half a million \\xc2\\xbbf acres at\\nOpotiki, will throw into the Government\\'s hands\\nsome of the first land in New Zealand, and the\\nsettlement of half the 1st Waikato Regiment\\nupon part of it will give security, and therefore\\nvalue to the remainder, which can at no distant\\ndate be sold for a good price. The province\\nof Auckland is promised a further loan of a quar-\\nter of a million to enable her\" to deal satisfac-\\ntorily with the ceded Waikato territory, but\\nhow the money is proposed to be used by the\\nProvincial Executive does not yet appear.\\nMr. Weld, the late Premier of this colony,\\nhas announced his retirement from public life\\nowing to ill-health. Had he done so before he\\nheaded a Ministry he would have carried far\\ndeeper regrets with him than he now can do\\nfrom most of the colony.\\nFrom the papers, per tho Prince Alfred steamer, wo quote\\nas follows :\\nUnder the head of Native Intelligence, in the Southern\\nCross, that journnl publishes somo \"gleanings\" on the\\nnativc question, which are not without thoir significance, and\\nfor the accuracy of which it vouches.\\nWo learn that many Europeans havo recently ponotratod\\ninto tbo bcai t of the disturbed districts, amongst the Pal\\nMnrire fanatics. With several of those tourists, wo have\\nhad an opportunity of speakincr. Starting from Auckland, and\\ngoing up to tho Waikato and Thames countries, ono remark\\nis made by all tourists-namely the diminished numbors of\\ntho natives. On being questioned regarding the cause of\\ntheir decrease, they state that the loss by war did not nearly\\nso much niTect them as tho loss by disease. Affeotiona of\\nthe throat and chest have been the chief agency in carrying\\noff (he native people ; and as they have, as a rule, gono book\\nto the licentious and communistic practices, in voguo\\ntwenty-five or thirty years ago (amongst othors, the whare\\npiihi), theie can bo little doubt that the mortality witt\\nincrease. . ,\\nSeveral gentlemen who penetrated into a comparatively\\nunknown country, in tho interior, were treated ovcrywhere\\nwith marked respect and kindness. They attribute tats to\\nwhat took place a short time previously at Matamata, wita\\nThompson. It would appear, as the natives report, that a,\\ndeputation from all tho inland tribes, numbering about tut)\\nmen, waited on Thompson, asking him to lead the tnbos ut\\nan attack on Auckland. Thompson isBaid to liave asked\\n.\\'Do you know tho way to Auckland?\" After a pauso,\\nthe deputation repliod-\" No ; but wo look to you to shoir\\nus tho wav.\" Thompson said-\" I tried to take Aucklani\\nonce, and! lost one eye. If I try to take it again I fear to\\n\\'otc tho other eyo. I made war on Auckland once, ano\\nWaikato is gone: if I mako war again I may lose\\nho Waiho (Thames).\" The deputation said no\\nmore. Thompson then added-\" As yea represent\\nall the native tribes and villages inland, mw\\nthat vou aro here, I may ns well toll you what I want\\nyou \\'to do. When any Europeans want to go\\nthrough your disfrute, they are not to be touched. \\\\ ou.\\naro not to murder onv ; you aro to help thom and treat morn.\\nwith kindness.\" Thedepulatton loft, carrying thismessaga.\\nto their villages; and the tourists to whom we refer hoard it\\nin a remoto district, through which Hereopa, with tho tewi\\nof a European, travelled only two day\\xc2\\xab previously. This\\nBpeaxs volumes for Thompson\\'s influence. .\\nOur informants often spoke on war subjects ; and oa being\\nquestioned whether it was peace or war, the natives invau\\nably answered, \" It will bo peace or war as Thompson\\ndecides.\" They are quito ready to fight-, and do not appear\\nI to think themselves lese ablo to drive tis into the sea, witt\\xc2\\xbb\\ndiminished numbers, than boforo thawar. .\\n| From Ngatimaniopoto wo learn that Rowi is anxious tor\\npeace, but that his fighting chief-his \" back;bono -\\nwants war.

      " 'BRIGHAM YOUNG\\'S MESSAGE. \\'\\nTHE message of Brigham Young, delivered according\\nto the Salt Lake iVetci, \"orally, on Monday, Feb-\\nruary 22nd, to the Senate and House of Represent-\\natives of the State of DeBeret,\" at Salt Lake City,\\noccupies nearly one and a halt columns of that paper.\\nWe make the following extract :\\nWe have met in the capacity of a State Legislature\\nwith a view to preserve our organisation, and with an\\neye to the time when, in the wisdom of God, He will\\nmove upon the minds of Senators and Members of\\nCongrecs to give us oar legal, national, and legitimate\\nrights. We wait with patience to see this done.\\nPerhaps to some it \\xc2\\xabvould seem unnecessary to keep\\nup this organisation ; but it is that we may preserve\\nour identity as a part of the nation that we assemble\\nannually in this capacity. If the machinery\\nis kept in order, when the time shall come\\nfor the water to be turned upon it there will\\nbe no difficulty in starting it. It is not so much\\nto enact laws and to sit in a Legislative capacity that\\nwe now meet, as to recognise our rights ; and in\\ndoing so we do no more than others have done and no\\nmore than is our right to do. If we who live in this\\ncountry were disposed to meet in this capacity three\\nhundred and sixty-five days in the year, it would con-\\ncern nobody but ourselves, except meddlers and those\\nwho wish to infringe upon the rights of our neighbours.\\nIn a republican government like ours it is our right to\\nmeet as we do to-day. We have the undoubted right\\nto meet together and consult upon those points,of\\ngovernmental affairs that pertain to our future peace,\\nend to gather the necessary information to enable us\\nto proceed further in the\\'duties of life. Whether,lin\\nthe providences of God, we Bhall be admitted aa a\\nState or not we leave with him. He will do as He\\npleaseB ; the hearts of all living are in His hands, and\\nwhattver condition He permits us to live in we shall\\naccept and conform to. Gentlemen, in coming together\\nto-day as the representa\\'ives of Deseret, we have the\\nproud satisfaction of knowing that we represent a people\\ncapable in every respectif governing and controlling\\nthemselves. We in this country have achieved a\\nfreedom and independence such as are rarely pos-\\nsessed by any people in these days. We raise our\\nown bread and eat it ; we make our bridges and\\nstreets and pay fur them ; we erect our public\\nbuildings, develope our resources, sustain our Govern-\\nment and officers, and are not in debt. That\\nwhich is accumulated as income from taxation is\\nappropriated for the benefit of the people. We have\\nno bondB in market for greedy financiers to speculate\\nin, to prove a cause of embarrassment to ourselves\\nor a vexation and announce to our children. Our\\nlegislators have been wise enough not to go beyond\\ntheir ability, and burden the people with a heavy\\nindebtedness without having resources to refund the\\nsame. Should we be aelmitted as a State, I look for\\nthe snn.e policy to be pursued ; we shall\\nnot fall into debt, _ but always live within\\nour mennB. This is the secret of succesB\\nwith men, communities, and nations. Take men\\nin any capacity whatever, whether singly or\\notheiwisc, and you will find that if they live within\\ntheir means they will be independent and powerful.\\nIt is so in the case of a single individual, ana it is in-\\ncreased))- so with a community or nation. We, as a\\npeople, have had wisdom enough to perceive and act\\nupon this. A people or Government rtat will suffer,\\nitself to get entangled through avarice or other causes,\\'\\nand bring upon ita people war and indebtedness, and\\nthen poverty and distress, proves that it is not capable\\nof exercising the proper lights of government. But a\\nnation that can maintain peace within i\\'s borders and\\nwith its neighbours, exhibits knowledge, wisdom, and\\npower that muBt eventually call forth the respect and\\nadmiiation of the world. Thus far we have been able\\nJ .to piestive ourselves from such contingencies. It is\\ntrue that war has been made upon us ; but the sword\\nof indignation has fallen harmless at our feet. Yet\\no,ur own .wisdom did not produce this; it was by the\\npowtr and wisdom of God, which He imparts to those\\nwho live eo as to receive them that they may preserve\\nthemselves. j\\nON POVEBTV.-111 informed in political economy,\\nthe poor are worse informed in all matters of domestic\\neconomy. Having scant wages to live upon, they\\nrarely spend those wages in the most prudent and\\nprofitable wav s. They are too often the prey to their\\nown perverted tastes, and to the tricksters who trade\\nupon those tastes. They buy bad food, and cook it\\nbadlj ; their bodies ore dirty,\" their clothes are dirty,\\ntheir hcmeB are dirty. Disgusted thereby, and\\nafflicted by the hopelessness of their condition, it is\\nalmost a tule for them to stifle their feelings in un-\\nwholesome drink ; and thus they pass, from bad to\\nwoice. Every clergyman, every dector, every one who\\nknows anything of the dwellings of the poor, can give\\nus instances. without number of the waste\\nar.d unthrift that there abound. People whese\\nearnings are barely enough, with the strictest\\neconomy, to supply their most pressing needs;\\npractise no economy at all. Families that\\nhave, perhaps, twelve or fifteen shillings a, week\\nto subsist on, do not get more than eight or ten\\nshillings\\' worth of actual subsistence. The rest is\\nsquandered foolishly or viciously. For this the poor\\nthemselves are very little to blame, How can they\\nbe expected to do better when they have never been\\ntaught, when their cares are so overwhelming, when\\nthey have every inducement to despondency and\\nnone to hope ? Yet this is surely a matter in which\\ncharitable persons, charitable women especially, might\\nexercise their charity with unspeakable advantage.\\nMuch they do ; but very much more has to be done\\nbefe re any important change can be wrought in the\\neccnomic habits of our mulions of poor. So muoh\\nthat any thorough reformation must be despaired of,\\nunlees another branch of education-in correction of\\nthe third sort of ignorance here to be alluded\\nto, and the most ruinous of all-is also zealously\\npromoted. No great improvement in the con-\\ndition and prospects of the poor can be hoped tor\\nuntil they are taught to exercise ordinary prudence\\nin limiting the size of their families in accordance\\nwith their means of decently and healthily maintain-\\ning those families. Tbis \\xc3\\x8dB not the occasion for dis-\\ncussing the general question of Malfhusianism, as it\\nis called. The great law of population, first enunciated\\nby the Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus in 1798-that\\nwhilst, in the most favourable circumstances, the\\nfood-producing powers of land can only he expected\\nto increase in an arithmetical ratio, population always\\nUr.ds to incieaeo in a geometrioal ratio; and that\\naccordingly, unleBB the area of population can be\\nadequately extended, its proper growth U inevitably\\nrestricted by famine, plague, war, and other in-\\nvoluntary checks, if not by voluntary checks\\nresorted to by man himself-is SB simple and\\nir controve\\xc3\\xad tibie as the Newtonian law of gravition.\\nAt any rate, though many have ridiculed\\nit, and many more haTe ignored it, no one has\\never seriously attempted to controvert it. Multitudes\\nhave rejeced it without consenting to reason upon it;\\nbut all of the few who have reasonably considered it,\\nhave been ferced to adopt it. The precise bearings of\\nthe law and its detailed applications, however, include\\nmany problems that have yet to be settled. We do\\nnot vet know how rnanv inhabitants our own country,\\nfor instance, can be fairly expected to maintain in\\nthat measure of comfort which all human beings haye\\na right to claim ; nor have the possibility and ex-\\npedience of drafting off to other and thinly peopled\\ndistricts those of our offspring for whom there is no\\nroom in. the me ther country, been properly taken\\naccount of; nor have the special means by which the\\nlaw shall be ec forced been dulv investigated and\\ndefined. These questions and others like them are\\nworihy of careful consideration, and will have to be\\nconsidered before long. But we need not, and may\\nIneit, wait for that time before recognising the force of\\ntrc law in its relation to the present state of the poor.

The fish, in ita respiration, consumes the\\noxygen held in solution by the water as atmospheric\\nair, furnishes carbonic acid, feeds on the insects and\\nycung snails, and excretes material well adapted as a\\nrich food to the plant, and well fitted for its luxuriant;\\ngrowth. The plant, by its respiration, consumes the\\ncarbonic acid produced by the fish, appropriating the\\ncarbon to the construction of ita tissues and fibres\\xc2\\xab\\nand liberates the oxygen in its gaseous state to sustain\\nthe healthy functions of the animal life; at the same\\ntime that it feeds on the rejected matter, which has\\nfulfilled its purposes in the nourishment of the _ fish\\nand snail, end preserves the water constantly in a\\nclean and healthy\\'condition. While the slimy snail,\\nfinding its proper nutriment in the decomposing\\nvegetoble matter and minute confervoid growth, pre-\\nvents their accumulation by removing them ; and by\\nits vital powers\" converts what would otherwise act as\\na poison into a rich and fruitful nutriment, again to\\nconstitute a pabulum for the vegetable growth, while\\nit also acts the important.- part of a purveyor to its\\nfinny neighbours.\" This perfect adjustment in the\\neconomy of the animal and vegetable kingdoms,\\nwhereby the vital functions of each are permanently\\nmaintained, is one of the most beautiful phenomena\\nef organic nature. In the marine aquarium, the pre-\\nsence of molluscs is as necessary as in the fresh-water\\naquarium, to prevent an excessive growth of con\\nfen a.-, which otherwise soon make the water turbid\\nwitn their innumerable green seeds or spores, and\\nobscure the glass by establishing themselves upon it\\nin vast colonies. The common periwinkle, topshell,\\nand limpet are very suitable for this purpose.\\nTUB New York Tribune uses the tallest language in\\nreporting the ceremony of the 4th instant. Mr.\\nLincoln\\'s words are recalled as \" beautiful and elo-\\nquent,\" and \" the sad spectacle of a drunken Vice\\nPresident\" is flung at the back of the out-going\\nChief Magistrate. There is not much exaggeration in\\nthis ; indeed, it is not until the Tribune reporter\\narrived in the ball room of the Waite House that he\\nwiitCB \" high falutin.\" Then, possibly the united\\neffect of the scene and champagne induced him to pen\\nthe following rapturous description of the Inaugural\\nBall:-\"Thebrilliant scene presented within and with-\\nout the building, radiant in colour, glowing with light,\\nbrilliant like tropical flowers or the plumage of hum-\\nming birds, and ever shifting and varying like a many\\nhued and constantly-changing kaleidoscope. Fahr faces,\\nlovely forms, penetrant perfumes diffused as the\\nbrilliant robes moved about their wearers ; distin-\\nguished men, bearing names renowned in war, states\\nmanship, letters, and the other activities of our\\ncrowding life, clothed in the martial uniform, wearing\\nthe orders and diplomatic insignia of their own\\nsovereignties, or, better still, in the simple if sombro\\ndress of the American citizen ; all these and much\\nmore met and mingled here. Great waves of music\\npuh-ated along the heated and perfumed atmosphere,\\nand the witching mazes of the dance, and the moro\\nbewitching forms of the dancers-the ladies of coursa\\n-with all the brilliancy and beauty of colour and\\nfe rm, made up a scene worthy of pencil or pen*, yet\\nboth must fail in any attempt to render it fitly.\"\\nPOSITION OF THE WAK MINISTER.-The Royal\\nOlder which defines the relation of the Commander-\\nin-Chief to the Queen, the Army, and the War Office^\\nwas published on Saturday. Now that it has been\\nbiought to light, the discovery of the Sangraal should\\nnot be despaired of. Member after member of the\\nHouse of Commons has gone in search of it, blun-\\ndered, gone far astray, lost himself, and then re-\\nturned to sit down in dumb resignation. The jealousy\\nwith which its official guardians kept their secret, and\\ntheir blank complacent look while the representatives\\nof the public were stumbling about in the dark after\\nit, vveie admirable in their way, but they are now\\nthings of the paBt. The Order has become\\na public document, and now that it is\\nsubmitted to the judgment of the country we\\nexpect to hear no more of the dispute whether ^4\\nthe Army is or is not under a dual government.\\nThe Roj al Order, which is dated Balmoral, October,\\n1861-five years after the Duke of Cambridge had\\nbeen appointed to the chief command-defines the\\nposition of his Rojal Highness in no mere incidental\\nmssner. The purpose for which it was framed is\\ndeclared to be \"to prevent any doubts as to the\\npowers and duties of the Commander-in-Chief.\"\\nThe Order does not, however, set forth what those\\npowers and duties are, but after staling to what\\nthey relate-the government of the Army and the\\nadministration of military affairs-it directs that\\n\" they \\xc3\\x9fhall be excepted from the Department of\\nthe Secretary of State for War.\" A second para-\\ngraph of the Order completes the purpose of the\\ntim, by strictly appropriating to the Commander\\nin-Chief all the powers and business relating to the\\nmatters - aforementioned. The latter are \"to be\\ndeemed to belong to hi\\xc3\\x9f office,\" and to be ad\\nmini&teied, \"subject to our (the Royal) general\\ncontrol over the government of the Army, and to the\\nresponsibility of the Secretary of State.\" Responsi-\\nbility for what ? Of course not for the act of the\\nCommander-in-Chief, whose powers and duties are\\nexcepted from the Department of the Secretary of\\nState for War, but, as the* Order further explains,\\n\" for the exercise of our Royal prerogative in that -\\nbehalf, and subject to any powers formerly exercised\\nby the Secretary at War. No words could more\\nplainly mark out the position of a great and in-\\ndependent e fficer of the State, who has the power of a\\nMinister without a Minister\\'s responsibility. We do\\nnot now ask whether this is an objectionable arrange-\\nment, or the best that could be made ; we are only\\n\\'calling attention to the evidence of the fact. The\\nmeaning and intention of the Older are beyond\\ndoubt, and so far BB they go they are in derogation\\nof the principle of responsible government which\\nEnglishmen are sSipposed to value highly.-Daily\\nNeus.\\nTHE DECAY 01 THE HOUSE OI COMMONS.\\nIt is very unsatisfactory to find that before the new\\nHouses of Parliament have been fully completed, they\\nare actually decaying in parts ; and the same esti-\\nmates include votes for the building itself, and for the\\nappliances to arrest the progress of destruction. The\\nstone of which it is constructed was taken from a\\nYorks!: ire quarry on the recommendation of a com-\\nmission appointed to inquire into the subject, but\\nalmost immediately after being placed in position, this\\nparticular stone began to shew signB of decay. The\\nfacade of the building was marked by large patches,\\nand the Gothic tracery of the architecture was sadly\\ndisfigured. So far back as 1857 various processes for\\npreserving the stone were tried on different parts of the\\nbuilding, and subsequently Professor Faraday and Sir\\nRoderick Murchison were requested to give their opin-\\nions on the relative merits of such methods. They con-\\ncurred in awarding the pre-eminence to the process\\nof M. Szerelmy, of which the particulars are, of\\ncourse, a secret. Professor Faraday, in his report,\\nsaid that so far as a judgment could be formed upon\\ntwo years\\' experience, he believed that the process\\nwould sustain its character for a lengthened period, of\\ntime. \\'\\' I do not find,\" said the learned professor,\\n\"in other parts of the building,\" where M. Szerelmy\\'\\xc2\\xbb\\napplication is more than two years old, any signs of\\nexfoliation, or defection of the prepared face of the\\nstone, or any grounds for fear in that respect.\" The\\nprocess has been applied with equal success to the\\niron of the roof, which was deteriorating at an equally\\nrapid rate. Part of it had been coated with \\xc2\\xbbino or\\ngalvanized iron. This had scarcely been fixed when\\nit showed signs of preihature oxydation. M.\\nSzerelmy\\'s preparation was applied to one of the\\naffected parts, and also to the gilding of the clock\\ntower. On a careful examination last year, it was\\nfound that the portion treated with the preservative\\nmaterial was perfectly sound, while the rest of the roof\\nhad suffered more or less from atmospheric influences.\\nThe First Commissioner of Works has accordingly\\ndirected that the remainder of the roof should be\\ncovered with the composition. Meanwhile the stone-\\nwork shews signs of disintegration, and there is som\\xc2\\xab\\nground for the anticipation that, so far as external ap-\\npearances are concerned, the new Palace at West-\\nminster will shortly look as ancient as the venerable\\nAbbey, which reckons as many centuries as Sir\\nCharles Barry\\'s costly building can reckon years,\\nM. Szerelmy\\'s process is capable of application to\\nmany kinds of building materials. Experiments have\\nbeen tried on stone, brick, iron railings, and timber,\\nwith very gratifying results. Pieces of timber coated \\'\\nwith the preparation have been sunk for two year\\xc2\\xbb in\\nhe water at Portsmouth, and are now perfectly sound.\\nTextile fabrics are also rendered waterproof and in-\\ndestructible by it.\\nAr-pAux-iNo ENTERTAINMENT.-Mr. Howard Paul,\\nwho is always indulging in some form of eccentric\\nadvertising, announces in the Daily TsUgraph that he\\nwill give JE6 fur a short sharp title for hil Entertain-\\nment at St. James\\'s Hall.

      " '\"WOMEN IN TURKEY.* .\\n(From the Times.)\\n[ Whoever Osman Bey may be, it cannot be denied\\nthat he has written an amusing and instructive book.\\nHis second title, \" Major Vladmimir Andrejevioh,\"\\nseems to imply that he is one of those Russian exiles\\nwho, finding their political or social opinions too ad-\\nvanced for their native country have fled to Turkey,\\ntaken root in her soil, and there flourished. Against\\nthis theory of his foreign origin must be set the fact\\nthat he writes of the Turks as a Turk-an\\nenlightened one, be it remarked. \"Nourri dans\\nle s\\xc3\\xa9rail, j\\'en connais les d\\xc3\\xa9tours,\" he says\\nof himself - speaking of \" our \" family,\\n\"our\" harem, and \"our\\' slaves as though\\nhe had been to the manner bred; while in one in-\\nstance, when telling us that it is the nature of that\\nunhappy class which guards Turkish harems to be\\neither mild and melancholy, or wild and demoniacal,\\nhe mentions that his mother, being the fortunate\\npossessor of one of the latter kind, got rid of him and\\nhis malignant presence in her household by making\\nhim a present to one of the Sultanas. For the rest,\\nOsman Bey seeing to have had powerful protectors\\namong the Pashas-old H- Pasha (Hafiz Pasha)\\nhaving been his great friend - to have been\\non the Staff and to have served a great\\ndeal in the precincts of the Sultan\\'s Palace.\\nSupposing him, therefore, to be a real personage,\\nwhich there seems little reason to doubt, Osman Bey\\nwas in a position to know his subject and to be\\ncapable of writing with authority, founded on expe-\\nrience, on \" Women in Turkey.\" ne can hardly,\\nindeed, remember the bad old times when the Slave\\nBazaar existed as a public institution at Constanti-\\nnople, when Circassia belonged to Turkey, and when\\nthe fair maidens of that land, were so common as tobe\\ncomparatively cheap. He had a friend, in-\\ndeed, who used to tell him of the old\\nstate of things, a sort of Turkish Legree\\xe2\\x80\\x94Hadji\\nAbdallah, of Morocco, a venerable ruffian, near a\\ncentury old, whose latter days seem to have been\\nspent in compelling recalcitrant ladies in the various\\nharems of Stamboul to be better behaved. Slight\\ncases of this kind he treated on the spot with stick\\nand whip ; more obstinate offenders he took in hand\\nat his own house by starvation and dungeons, and\\ntorture; and it was generally remarked that when\\nthese ladies returned they were \\'singularly obedient.\\nOne visit to the old Hadji\\'s house was enough, for, as\\none of them confessed, she was afraid lest she should\\nhave been buried alive, a little accident which had\\noften happened in Hadji\\'s dealings with obstinate\\nladies. That was what he did towards the end of his\\ndays. His earlier life had been spent in carrying off\\nslaves in every possible way, begging, borrowing, and\\nstealing them, and then selling them in the Slave\\nBazaar, in which business he had acquired an ample\\nfortune.\\nBut to return to Osman Bey, as his experience of\\nConstantinople does not carry him back more than\\ntwenty or thirty years, it is rather of new Turkey\\nthat he writes than of the old. Though he can re-\\nmember the wild justice which even the mild Abdul\\nMedjid dealt out to one or two of the friskiest\\nSultanas and their favourites, the days of the sack\\nand the bowstring were pretty nearly over before he\\nknew Turkish life. It is enlightened Turkey that\\nhe describes, and though he handles his native or\\nadopted country with comparative tenderness, he can\\nfind no enlightenment for Turkey until the two great\\nplague-spots of the Ottoman system\\xe2\\x80\\x94the degradation\\nof women and the existence of slavery\\xe2\\x80\\x94have been\\nhealed. Nor let any reader imagine, that his treat-\\nment of these two evils is light and trivial. His book\\nis no prurient collection of anecdotes raked together\\nfrom the hotbed of the harem. He begins from the\\nbeginning, and points out the inherent vice of Ma-\\nhomet\\'s system, in which, while recommending true\\nbelievers to have but one wife, he permits them to\\nhave four, and even to add to that number innumera-\\nble concubines. In a word the Prophet tried to\\ncure the evils of polygamy as it existed\\nbefore his time in the East and failed.\\nHe gave his followers good advice, while he winked\\nat the bad practices which he denounced. Slavery,\\ntoo, he found engrained in the civilization of the East,\\nand though he ameliorated it so that the lot of slaves\\nin Turkey, according to Osman Bey, is comparatively\\neasy, still he permitted it, and there it exists side by\\nside with polygamy as one of the curses of modern\\nTurkey. There can be no real enlightenment in a\\ncountry, no element of stability in a system which\\nat one and the same time looks on woman as an inferior\\nbeing and regards her as a chattel or plaything, and\\nkeeps large classes of the community in bondage for the\\nprofit of a peculiar class. Until these flagrant wrongs\\nhave been remedied, Osman Bey sees no prospect for the\\ncontinuance of the Ottoman Empire, the existence\\nof which he declares has been only prolonged by the\\njealousy of the Great Powers which surround it.\\nWere it left to itself, it woudd dissolve into as many\\nfragments as there are nationalities which profess the\\nMussulman faith.\\nHaving thus disposed of polygamy and slavery in\\nprinciple, Osman Bey, as one who well knows all\\nthe ins and outs of domestic life in Turkey, pro-\\nceeds to give a very lively and amusing descrip-\\ntion of the Turkish household, as shown in the\\nrespective relations of man and wife, or rather of\\na man and his wives. Under the instances of Izzed\\nBey and Zerah, an imaginary couple, he shows how\\na legitimate Turkish marriage-that is, when a young\\nwell-to-do Turk marries a young lady his equal in\\nsocial position-comes after all to be very like what\\nthe proverb tell us is the\\' fate of those who are rash\\nenough to buy a pig in a poke. When Izzed Bey\\ninforms his mother or best female friend of his desire\\nto marry, he need trouble himself no further in the\\nmatter till she comes back, and tells him that she has\\nfound in Zera, a moon-faced, plump young lady, the\\nobject of his affections. It may seem absurd, but Osman\\nBey declares it to be true, that it is part of the young\\nTurkish nature to fall vidlently in love on the spot\\nwith this imaginary object, whom Izzed Bey has\\nnever seen and never will really see till the fatal\\nmoment when, in the bridal chamber, he lifts the rose\\nhued veil and beholds in the object of his affections\\neither a houri or a ghoul, or, it may be, a nondescript\\nsomething between the two. But so it is ; Izzed\\nBey is at once enamoured, worships the tip\\nof his mistress\\'s little finger when poked\\nout of a lattice, or her eyes as she whirls by\\nhim in a carriage. So the courtship proceeds till\\nall is settled between the mothers and a handsome\\nsum paid down by the bridegroom. At last the\\nhappy day arrives, and all the world hastes to the\\nwedding to behold the bride standing upright,\\nveiled from head to foot : to admire the presents,\\nand to make remarks not always complimentary on\\nthe bridegroom, who has to run the gauntlet of the\\nsharp tongues of all beholders. Thus the day wears\\non, until the happy pair are left alone, and Izzed\\nBey lifts Zerah\\'s veil, and either discovers that he\\nis the happy possessor, of charms which, reckoned\\nin the Turkish fashion, would be worth, if the bride\\nwere a slave, some three or four thousand pounds,\\nor the unhappy owner of one or those scraggy, very\\nplain persons who at the same valuation would be\\ndear at fifty shillings. In the first case it is quite\\npossible that the union of Izzefd and Zerah may be\\nlong and happy ; in tho last, it is not likely to last\\nmany moons in a country where mere physical\\nbeauty goes for so much, and where the women are\\nsingularly uneducated\\nBut what is to be done, setting beauty on one\\nside, if what is known in England as incompati-\\nbility of temper springs up between the new-married\\ncouple ? Are the Turkish mon and wife bound to\\nlive on chained together? Not at all, if it is the\\nhusband\\'s wish. He has only to say, \" Get away with\\nthree; banish thee from my house,\" and the\\npoor thing must take heeself off there and then and\\nnever darken his doors again. That is the Turkish\\nlaw of divorce, and, be it observed , it is not reciprocal.\\nNo woman can repeat the same words and be rid of a\\nbrute of a husband. One right she has which was\\nmade much of by John Stuart Mill\\xe2\\x80\\x94she has the\\nentire disposal of her property, whether as a wife or\\nas a divorced woman ; but, as Osman Bey well points\\nout, the general condition of women in Turkey is so\\nabsolutely one of dependence on the male sex that a\\nwife can hardly spend her own money without the\\nconsent or assistance of a husband ; and\\nif divorced finds herself so preyed on by\\nadventurers that she is forced in self-defence to\\nfind another husband in order to free herself from\\ntheir machinations. But, of course, this speedy divorce\\nbetween Izzed Bey and Zerah is not common. Every\\nill-assorted union in Turkey is not cut short by those\\ndreadful words. The unhappy pair may still live to-\\ngether, and the husband, at least, be made happy.\\nHow? By that gloss called polygamy, which accom-\\npanies the text of the Koran, which recommends all\\ntrue believers to have but one wife Izzed Bey, if he\\nhas the will and the means, may have four wives all\\nat once, and supplement them with as many slaves\\nas his pocket can procure. Zerah will always be\\nhis \"first\" wife; but he may take to him another\\ncalled \"the second,\" a third called \"the middle\\none,\" and a fourth who rejoices in the title of \" the\\nlittle one,\" and who, though the last, is usually not the\\nleast in the dear love of her lord. And here arises\\none of the great economical objections to polygamy\\nits expense. Some people in Europe know how costly\\nLes Femmes en Turquie, par Osman Bey (Major Vladimir\\nAndreierUlil. P*ds : Catmwi, Levy, and Co. 1878.\\none wife can he ; but here, under one and the same\\nroof, there may be four,-all, be it remarked, with\\nseparate rooms, slaves, and establishments for them\\nand their children ; all clamouring for fine clothes\\nand sweetmeats and trinkets, and all expecting\\na carriage in which to take the air and\\neunuchs on gaily-caparisoned horses to ride\\nafter them. Quite apart from the intrigues of\\nthese ladies against one another, it is clear that\\npolygamy is a question of money, and at once implies\\none law of marriage for the rich and another for the\\npoor. The ordinary working Turk, if you can sup-\\npose so lordly a race ever to work, rubs on with one\\nwife and a slave or two ; a happier man, no doubt,\\nthan Izzed Bey, who, discontented with Zerah, marks\\neach step of his rise in life by taking to him a new\\nwife, until before he is buried himself he may, like\\nOsman Bey\\'s old patron, Hafiz Pasha, have married\\nand buried more wives than he could reckon on his\\nfingers.\\nAnd after \\'the legitimate wives come the slaves ;\\nslaves both female and male. As to the first the\\nTurk hates trouble. But legitimate marriage with\\nan equal such as we have described in the case of\\nIzzel Bey and Zerah takes time and trouble. It is\\nsomothing like that heavy form of marriage called\\n\" confarreatio,\" which got to be so tiresome to Roman\\npatricians. Why have all this worry when you can\\ngo to some private slave-dealer, for though there is no\\nslave bazaar, slaves are bought and sold every day at\\nConstantinople ? Why not go to some modern Hadji\\nAbdallah and choose for yourself, not at all on the\\npig-in-the-poke principle, but by natural selection\\nface to face ? That is how many of the Turkish\\nharems are filled with white female slaves, all more or\\nless valuable in the wife market. It is a horrid\\npractice, and the Turks ought to blush at it ; only\\nwe remember that young ladies, though, not slaves,\\nare often bought or sold for wives in other European\\ncountries. As for the male slaves, they are chieily\\nnegroes, and so are the lower female slaves who do\\nall the hard work in the household, for no Turk\\nwill work if he can help it, and so he must have\\nslaves. In his own household Osman Bey gives us\\nan amusing instance of the uselessness of a free\\nTurkish woman who came in to help. This unfor-\\ntunate creature was forced to give up the place, be-\\ncause whenever she had taken off her veil and was\\njust settling down to her work some man would\\npass through the room, when she had at once to\\nhuddle on her veil and turn her back to the in-\\ntruder lest he should behold her face. At last,\\nin throwing on her veil while she held a lighted\\ncandle in her hand, she set herself on fire, and had\\nto be put out by Osman Bey himself. The difficulties\\nof free female labour under such conditions may be\\nimagined. Our housemaids are bad enough, but what\\nwould they be if they had to jump up and veil them-\\nselves every other minute lest John or Thomas should\\nbehold their very ordinary faces ? Slaves, therefore,\\nare necessary to the Turk, both in his marital, his\\nsocial, and his domestic relations. They are an institu-\\ntion, and so long as the present Ottoman system\\ncontinues, slaves must form part of the daily existence\\nof the Turk.\\nThat is, so long as the present Ottoman system con-\\ntinues, but how long can it be capable of continuing\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94we do not say in the recesses of Asiatic Turkey, but\\nin that portion of the Empire which touches European\\ncivilization, and which, therefore, may and must be\\ncivilized ? The first step to that civilization will be\\nthe emancipation of women from their present thral-\\ndom ; for, as Osman Bey well insists, \" civilization is\\nthe joint work of both sexes, and to degrade the one\\nis to fetter and prevent the healthy action and energy\\nof the other.\" The time has come when the\\nTurk must look at home, and consider what\\nhe really is if he is to continue any longer\\na European Power. He must reform and\\nremodel his social and domestic relations along with\\nhis political system. It is not a question of religion,\\nfor Mahomet, in spite of his fifteen wives, recom-\\nmended monogamy to his disciples. Polygamy, too,\\nas we have seen, is a question of money. Few Turks\\n.can have more than one wife. If they had, the in-\\nequality of the sexes would be so great that half the\\nmen in the country would be cutting the throats of\\nthe other half for the sake of their women. But how\\nis the reform to begin ? Not assuredly by any\\nof those sham concessions which are so well\\nexposed by Osman Bey in his book. Poly-\\ngamy in Turkey will not be extinguished by\\nany such feeble innovations as what he calls\\n\" Diplomatic Polygamy\" inaugurated, we believe, by\\nRedschid Pasha, by which plan each high functionary\\nwas to have one diplomatic presentable wife who ap-\\npeared in society, while he retained his other three\\nold wives in separate retreats near Constantinople.\\nThis, quite apart from its absurdity, resolved itself,\\nagain, at last into a question of expense.\\nThe new reform in Turkish polygamy must begin\\nwhere its evils are most apparent, and where it will\\nproduce the greatest effect on the subjects of the\\nSultan. That spot is no less than the Seraglio of\\nthe Sultan himself, of which Osman Bey treats\\nin the third part of his book. In the harem, or\\nwoman\\'s part of the Seraglio, he has never set foot ;\\nbut he knows every corner of the mabein, or male\\nquarter, of that immense palace, and he does not\\nhesitate to say that the social and domestic reform\\nof Turkey must begin within its walls. What with\\nthe harem with its seven classes of Sultanas, from\\nthe Sultana Valide to the Imperial Princesses with\\ntheir separate establishments of ladies and eunuchs,\\nthere are not far from 2000 souls in the harem of\\nthe Sultan. Then on the male side, between\\nbuffoons, musicians, eunuchs, cooks, and dwarfs,\\nthe Commander of the Faithful has more than\\n1000 attendants to wait on him. Fancy 3000\\nsouls and bodies, all extravagant and grasping, and\\nreckon how many purses it must cost to maintain the\\nestablishment in the Seraglio. One little fact, if it\\nbe a fact, may show how wasteful the Sultan\\'s ways\\nare. According to Osman Bey, it wouid he con-\\nsidered high treason against the dynasty of Othman if\\nthe Sultan ever wore any article, of dress twice. From\\nthe fez on his head to the slippers on his feet he must\\nhave new clothes every day of his life. His tailors\\nmust have no sinecure ; and as for the Sultan himself,\\nhow he must suffer from new coats and pantaloons on\\nevery day ; never allowed to keep any article of his\\ndress till\\' he can get fond of it ; and then if he be\\nenlightened to wear shoes, how his feet must be tor-\\ntured by a new pair every day. His 400 wives and\\ntheir quarrels and their children must be bad\\nenough, but new shoes every day would be worse.\\nSeriously speaking, all this barbarous and useless\\nextravagance must be swept away; the Augean\\nstable of the Seraglio must be cleansed. The new\\nSultan will have hard work to make both ends meet\\nin future. Let him try to effect that useful process\\nby a reform which has became a necessity for the\\npreservation of his Empire.\\nSroJiTiNoLoitE.-The discovery of bows and arrows,\\nand also the remains of apparently favourite hunting\\ndogs in the burial-places of the early Celts, seem (the\\nGardeners\\' Magazine remarks) to prove the war that\\nwas waged by our ancestors against the wild animals\\nwhich infested the wide British forests, as well as\\nwith the object of obtaining food. History also tells\\nthat it became a pleasurable puisuit with the early\\nchiefs, nobles, and kings. The country at that date\\nwas filled with such animals as the wolf, bear, boar, wild\\ncattle, ns well as the deer, wild swine, goats, &c, which\\nafforded objects of chase. The wolf, it is well known,\\nwas once very common in England. The month of\\nJanuary was by the Anglo-Saxons called Wolf\\nmonat, as, according to an old writer, \" people aro\\nwont always in that moneth to be more in danger to\\nbe devoured of wolves than in any season els of the\\nyeare.\" This animal was looked upon as a type of\\ncourage and ferocity, and, as implying those qualities\\nwhich in those days were so highly esteempd, it was\\nfrequently adopted as a name. Thus we find Ethul\\nwulf, the noble wolf; Berthwulf, the illustrious\\nwolf, &c. Great pains were taken to exterminate this\\ndangerous and destructive animal, which appears to\\nhave been first taken in hand by King Edgar, who\\ncommuted the Welsh tribute from gold and silver to\\n300 wolves\\' heads. -Edward the First, too, gave re-\\nwards for their destruction, and, according to Camden,\\nlands were held by some persons on the tenure of\\nhunting and killing them. The wild boar was no less\\nardently pursije\\'d. In connection with the boar was\\nan old supprstrtion that its tusks were hot, and burned\\nanything which they touched. The heat .of his\\nteeth was said to inflame any wounds he made,\\nand burn the hair of the dogs\\'. Although the hare\\nwas hunted by the ancient Greeks, it was some time\\nbefore it became an object of chase with our fore-\\nfathers, by whom it was considered unclean and unlit\\nto eat. Ciesar mentions the great numbers of these\\nanimals which he found in Britain. In early times\\nthe fox, whose thieving character had alrcndy ob-\\ntained for him a bad name, was tiapped, dug out,\\nspeared, or attacked with clubs and arrows, and it\\nwas not till long after that ho obtained the distinction,\\nof being chased in the modem style.\\nGerman Medical Students.- The Official Alma\\nnack informs us that the number of medical\\nstudents entered at the various German schools during\\nthe past year was 0116.

      " '. Ofce Ss\\xc3\\xb6nca iWorn\\xc3\\xadtts jQerattu\\nTHURSDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1871.\\nTHE terrible events of Paris have set all\\npersons accustomed to inquire into the causes\\nof things to endeavour to expound those which\\nHave led to this fearful episode in the history\\nof civilization. The strength of the rebellion\\nand the destruction which it wrought, the\\nterrible sacrifice of life in its suppression,\\nand the apparent reappearance of its elements\\nin another form, have filled the world with\\nwonder and with alarm. \"Where is it all to\\nend?\\nThe highest form of civilization existing in\\nEurope has, by common consent, been attri-\\nbuted to Paris. The moat perfect examples\\nof skill, both in science and in art, have been\\nfurnished by its population. It was the most\\nbeautiful city, and had the greatest range of\\npleasures of every kind, and in the most perfect\\norder. Europe received from the French\\ntheatre its popular plays, It received from\\nthe same source its universal fashions. Luxury\\npf all kinds was carried to the highest per-\\nfection in Paris. Nowhere was the art of\\ncookery capable of producing such diet. In no\\n\\'country could all the adornments of the house,\\nof the person, of the table, be so readily\\n\\'assembled. The rich people of eveiy nation\\nhastened to Paris to partake of these splen-\\ndours and these pleasures, which continued\\nthroughout the season without intermission.\\nThe citizens of this great metropolis of gaiety\\nand enjoyment looked with complacency on the\\n. gathering of all people to pay homage to their\\nintelligence, skill, and boundless resources.\\n.Those who look back two or three years to\\n\\'what Paris was-say, when the Great Exhibi-\\ntion attracted all the world-and what Paris\\nhas become, may well be stunned with aston-\\nishment or moved with pity. All this\\nsplendour and plensure passed away, and the\\ncity finally fell under the power of its lowe\\xc3\\x9ft\\ninhabitants, who endeavoured to gain its con\\ntiol, to subject its wealth, its intelligence, its\\nrefinement, all it possessed, to a domination\\nwhich, when embodied in the persons of\\nihose who wielded it, strikes the mind with\\nabsoluta terror.\\nA splendid paper has been contributed to\\nthe Revue des Deua Mondes, by M. E. CAKO,\\non one phase of this great phenomenon,\\nentitled, \" The End of Bohemia, or the lite-\\nrary Influences in these Last Events.*\\' This\\ntreatise attributes the Communist Revolution\\nto the ascendancy of that class created by the\\nrefinements and the yicissitudes of the great\\ncity. A Bohemian signifies, in French phrase,\\na writer living by ephemeral literature, an in-\\nferior artist of any kind, a member of the\\nmedical or legal orders without patients or\\nclients.-any person, in short, thrown upon\\nthe casualties of a calling, and dependent\\nday by day upen the fluctuating success of a\\nprofession. It is from this class have arisen\\nthe writers who have corrupted, or at least\\nexpressed the \\xc2\\xa1corruption of, Parisian society.\\nI They are principally persons who have no\\nrecognised position, no established reputation,\\nwho live day by day having this question\\ncontinually recurring, Where shall we dine, and\\nhow shall we pay for our meal ? They live on\\nthe margin of society, in isolation. They are\\ndevoured by envy. Their chances are an\\nelection to the academy of France, or a place in\\nthe hospital or^in the morgue. These persons,\\nhaving no recognised status in society, have\\nmade themselves the expounders of every senti-\\nment which divides and corrupts it. They\\nhave produced a literature only copied faintly\\n| in the English publications. All the bad\\npassions of mankind have been analysed and\\nlaid open in the mocking tone of those who share\\nthem, who have boasted of them, and who haye\\nbeen destroyed by them. They have professed\\nno moral principle, they have offered no ideal,\\nthey have animuted no effort for the improve-\\nment of mankind. They have put, without\\ndisguise, the defects and disordeis of society\\ninto the language of derision, and, while they\\nhave lessened the respect for human nature\\nas a whole, they ha\\\\e been equally opposed to\\nall those institutions which have been de-\\nsigned to raise the fallen and solace the dis-\\ntressed. Their lessons have been intended to\\nexcite a hatred against the persons of men, an\\nenvy of their good fortune, and of those\\nsuperiorities which arise from knowledge or\\nindustry. The only tone in which they have\\nbeen known to addiess the unhappy portions\\nof society has been calculated not to relieve\\nbut to exasperate their resentment. They\\nhave said to the vicious that they have been\\nmade so by the organization of society; to\\nthose who have found it difficult to live, that\\nthe rich have taken away their natural right to\\ntheir portion in this world. All that society\\nhas secured by united labour foi the go\\xc2\\xbbd of\\nthe State has been treated as deductions from\\nthe daily enjoyment of the workman. The\\nemployers of labour have been always spoken\\nof as criminals, who are joined together in con-\\nspiracy against the operatives.\\nThe consequence of thiB kind of \"education,\\ncontinued for twenty years under the shadow\\nof an Imperial system, was to produce a fixed\\nhatred of everything that existed and a\\ndesperate determination to reverse, to over\\ntlnow, and to sweep all that had been ex-\\nhibited as the representative of wealth or dis-\\ntinction. It is this literature which has found\\nin tiie daily Press a full development for the\\nlast two years. The relaxation of the\\nlaws and the fall of the Empire gave\\nstill fuller scope for these opinions.\\nThe conduct of many prominent persons\\nafforded the text of satire and denunciation.\\nDuring the siege of Paris the clubs were j\\nruined, and the Bohemian class made them the\\nmedium of their propagandism. Men, women,\\nand children attended these assemblies, and\\nthe most extravagant oratory found the\\nwarmest reception. There were two classes of\\nspeakers. Commonly the orators of the work-\\ning class had somo degree of sincerity. But the\\nold leaders weie mete actors ; they were\\n. obtaining a living or a place without any\\nfaith in the principles which they proclaimed.\\nThey had experienced a long trial of patience.\\nTheir contribution* to the Press could not in\\nordinary times provide them with bread. The\\nrevolution carne lo float them upon the surface.\\nWhen the Commune was proclaimed they\\nseized its guidance. They appropriated\\nthe profits upon which they could\\nlay their hands, and, without believing in the\\npermanence of anything, turned to present\\naccount the wild rage of those who were\\nincapable of discerning their delusions. The\\nnumber of men of this class who assumed\\nomeo in the Commune was remarkable. They\\nhad a degree of education, of science, and\\nknowledge of society, but they had long been\\nnmong the disinherited. What a change,\\nthen, to become, even for three months, the\\ndignitaries of a great city, and to command\\nan army of 100,000 men.\\nA remarkable development of the Commune\\nwas the prominence it gave to some female\\npoliticians. The emancipation of woman was\\na grand cry. Lectures were delivered and\\njournals published by them in this interest.\\nThe incidents of the last revolution show how\\nfrightful was the demoralisation of Communist\\nwomen. i\\nAmong the stimulants of mischief with\\nwhich the Bohemian had been long familiar\\nis to be reckoned the use of absinthe. This\\ndangerous liquor produces a special kind of\\nfrenzy more pernicious than ordinary spirits,\\nand more maddening than opium. It is im-\\npossible to say how far even this agent of\\nhuman degradation is responsible for the crimes\\nof the revolution.\\nThe author attributes the character of this\\ninsurrection to the utter absence of religious\\nprinciple in the Bohemian class. While the\\nsavons and philosophers have been propound-\\ning the doctrines of atheism in elegant lan-\\nguage, and as the means of liberating the\\nmind from all prejudices, the lower classes\\nof writers have accepted their conclusions, and\\nsurrounded them with all the decorations of\\nan obscene literature. Every excitement to\\nthe indulgence of the passions has been pro\\n\\xc2\\xa1 duced in their writings ; and their whole\\ns) stem - has been based on negations. Is\\nthere a GOD? No. Is there a future\\nstate\\'? No. IS there a soul? No. Is\\nthere responsibility for tinknown actions\\'?\\nThere is none. Is theie any compensation\\nfor patient suffering? Never. Is there any\\nreason for the relations of social life ? No\\nThese have been the set of principles with\\nwhich Communism has started There are\\nnumbers who have professed to substitute\\nothers for them ; but these at present have\\nremained in all their deadly influence, and\\nhav\\xc3\\xb6 shown themselves in the terrible events\\nof this last civil war.\\nAN , interesting discussion took place a few\\n.months ago in the Ilouse of Commons in\\nrelation to harbours of refuge on the English\\ncoast. The question involved the considera-\\ntion of a large variety of facts, commercial,\\nhumanitarian, and national. The debate arose\\non a motion by Lord C. J. HAMILTON, whose\\nobject was to obtain a grant of public\\nmoney for the construction of a harbour of\\nrefuge at Filey in Yorkshire. The policy\\nof making further grants of public money\\nto construct and improve harbours of refuge\\non the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland\\nhad been the subject of inquiry and solici-\\ntation during the previous fourteen years.\\nA committee recommended that national money\\nshould be granted for the construction\\nof harbouis of refuge, and that funds\\nshould also be voted towards the extension\\nand improvement of existing harbours. It\\nwas also proposed that a commission of\\ninquiry should -visit the coast for the pur-\\npose of inquiry. This was delayed by\\nchange of Government ; but the commis-\\nsioners having been appointed, brought up\\na report recommending that \\xc2\\xa32,365,000\\nshould be granted, with loans at a low\\ntate of interest for harbours, on condition\\nthat cci tain stated local suma should be\\nraised to meet the national grants. These\\nfacts were stated by Lord HAMILTON, who\\nalso gave an account of the numerous\\nattempts which had been made in vain to\\ngive practical effect to the report of the\\ncommissioners, which, however, was opposed\\non the ground that it was \" altogether too\\nsweeping.\" Mr. MILNER GIBSON, when Pre-\\nsident of the Board of Trade, incurred con-\\nsiderable odium by his opposition, and when\\nsailors were drowned on the coast, there\\nwere those who did not hesitate to speak\\nof the widows of those unfortunate\\nseamen, as \" MILNER GIBSON\\'S widows.\"\\nAttempts to induce the House to adopt the\\nreport of the commissioners were renewed in\\neach session from 1862 to 1865, and the sub-\\nject was revived in 1866 and 1869, but without\\nany results satisfactory to its promoters.\\nAmong the commercial facts adduced during\\nthe debate it was stated that the trade was\\nmost extensive on the north-east coast, and\\nthat its harbours were barred, and there-\\nfore not approachable at all tides. It was\\nghen in e-vidence that the entire tonnage of\\nBritish sailing vessels clearing coastwise from\\nports in England was 8,162,000 tons ; coast\\nwajs and foreign together, 15,796,00<>; and\\nthat the annual loss to the nation by wrecks\\nivas a million and a half sterling. But since\\nthat e\\\\idcnce was given there had been a very\\nlaige increase in the foreign as well as in\\nthe coasting trade. The total foreign and\\ntoasting trade in 1857 was 23,178,782 tons\\n(Blitish ships), or an average per month\\nof 1,931,565 tons. But in February of the\\npresent year, the total foreign and coasting\\ntrade was 5,156,000 tons. Taking the coasting\\ntrade only there was a considerable increase\\nshown. In 186-9, the coasting trade for the\\nmonth of February showed 2,587,000- tons.\\nIn February, 1871, it represented 2,684,900\\ntons. Lord HAMILTON, speaking of the\\nfisheries on the coast, quoted from the report\\no\\xc3\\xad the Commissioners of Fisheries in 1866,\\nto show that the annual value of the fisheries\\non the east coast was \\xc2\\xa32-,000,000, and that\\n\"the north-east coast fisheries were of the\\nsame extent as the supcrfitial area of\\nIreland, and were annually increasing in\\nvalue to the extent of \\xc2\\xa310,000 per\\nannum.\" The Boaid of Trade re-\\nturn showed, iL that the number of re-\\ngistered fishing boats in England was 16,195,\\nrepresenting 127,013 tons, and employing\\nI 47,290 men, and 7467 boys.\"\\nThese figures, indicating the large commercial\\ninterest at stake, were not disputed, and facts\\nwere given te show how gieat are the advan-\\ntages which may be expected from an improve-\\nment of the harbours on the coast. As in this\\ncolony in regard to railways, so there appears\\nto have been in the House of Commons on\\nthis matter much local rivalry, and\\nthe question divided itself into two main\\nbranches - first, as to the expediency\\nof spending large sums of money on one\\nharbour of refuge, when (it was arguod)\\n\" unless \\'.they were multiplied almost ad\\nw\\xc3\\x9fnitum they would be of very little use;\" |\\nand, second, as to how far Government\\nassistance ought to be extended towards the\\nimprovement of harbours. It was stated by\\none member that the Government had advanced\\nmoney on easy terms to the Tyne Harbour\\ncommisioners. Another observed that the\\nsum of \\xc2\\xa31,600,000 had been spent during the\\nlast few years in improving the approach to\\nthe Tyne Uiver so as to render it a good\\nharbour of refuge ; that most of the\\nmoney was made a local charge ; and\\nthat, in consequence of the improvements\\neffected, a herring fishery had been estab-\\nlished there. By an Act passed in 1861,\\nmoney may be granted for harbour improve-\\nments on condition that it be repaid, with\\ninterest, in twenty years. The Tyne Harbour\\ncommissioners had availed themselves of\\nthese harbour loans; but it was remarked\\nthat they had not done so to such an ex\\nlent as they would otherwise have been\\nglad to do had the interest not been in-\\ncreased. They obtained \\xc2\\xa3100,000 at 3J per\\ncent., and another \\xc2\\xa3100,000 at 3.J per cent. ;\\nbut the Government after that refused to\\nlend to them at less than 5 per cent.,\\nand the commissioners became reluctant to\\nborrow on those terms.\\nFrom a national standpoint it was argued\\nthat Filey ought to bo made a harbour of\\nrefuge. It was contended that the events\\nof the past few months had altogether\\naltered the military position of the country;\\nthat England had now to look for danger\\nnorn the East, and that therefore the |\\nconstruction of a naval station on the east\\ncoast was a matter of serious moment. It\\nwas also remarked by the mover that\\nFiley was recommended by the committee of\\n1857 from a strategetical point of view-1\\nthat it would be good as a look-out, and\\nsafe for shipping in time of war. Several\\nauthorities were quoted showing the import-\\nance of a naval station on the east coast,\\nand these were supplemented by arguments\\nbased on local considerations.\\nThe humanitarian reasons urged recall the\\ndangers and sacrifices annually made in the\\ncause of commerce and navigation - the\\nterrible disasters which occur to vessels baffled\\nby winds and unable to weather rocky\\npoints - ships with torn sails and broken\\nmasts left to the fury of a gale - the\\nfoundering of vessels unable to find a\\npott of refuge, and long lines of coast\\nblack with wreck. The members were\\nreminded of \" scenes of agony which\\nbeggared description,\" and certainly the loss\\nof life shown is most lamentable. All this\\nwas admitted by the Government. Mr.\\nGLADSTONE quoted from a Parliamentary\\npaper the number \\xc2\\xa9f shipwrecks which had\\noccurred during eleven years, showing that\\n1480 lives had been lost on the south coast,\\n1240 on the north coast, and 2772 in the\\nIrish Sea. But the inference he drew from\\nthe figures was, that there was no\\nmaterial diff\\xc3\\xa9rence to be traced be-\\ntween those portions of the coast which\\nhad harbours of refuge, and those which had\\nnot. The policy of the Government was\\nclearly stated to be in favour of an improve-\\nment in the mercantile marine, and it was\\nheld that a reckless plan for a wholesale\\ncreation of bar-harbours would have the effect\\nof retarding that improvement. It was argued,\\nhowever, on the other side, that much re-\\nmained yet to be done, inasmuch as it could\\'\\nnot be denied, in the face of wrecks so\\nnumerous, that many ships went to sea in\\nan unsafe condition.\\nBut the most fatal objection to the propo-\\nsition appeared to be its local- application ;\\nand upon this point Mr. GLADSTONE and\\nMr. LOWE spoke out boldly. The former\\nsaid he could not do otherwise than euter\\nhis protest against local propositions of the\\nkind, \" because they were a fruitful source\\nof political demoralization.\" Mr. LOWE said :\\n-\" The noble mover did not propose to fol-\\nlow the general spirit of the recommendation\\nof the Commission, but picked out one iso-\\nlated point, with respect to which the Consoli-\\ndated Fund was to contribute all, and local\\nresources nothing. A more fatal blow, not\\nonly at the Exchequer, but at the reputation\\nof that House, could not be imagined. He\\nhad some experience on such a point. He had\\nbeen a member of a Colonial Assembly, the\\ngreatest part of the time of which was taken\\nup in discussing measure\\xc2\\xbb such as the noble\\nlord now proposed, involving the application\\nof general revenue to local purposes, such as\\nthe making of a road in one place, or the con-\\nstruction of a railway in another. The main\\ntime of the Legislature was occupied in that\\nmost discreditable manner, and he, therefore,\\nventured from practical experience to warn\\nthe House not to encourage such motions as\\nthe present, for it would find no course so\\ninjurious to the respect and estimation it\\nshould be held in by the \\'public as countenanc-\\ning the grant out of the general revenue of the\\ncountry of money to be expended for local\\npurposes.\"\\nTUB SYDNEY MONTHLY OVERLAND MAIL.\\nThe Summary of colonial DOWS for transmission to\\nEurope by the Btoomship Kaugoon will bo published in this\\njournal to-uiorrow (Friday) morniagi tho Cth instant.\\nAdvertisers are particularly requested to send in their\\nfavours early this (Thursday) ovening.

      " 'THE CRISIS AT CONSTANTINOPLE,\\nI -\\'?\\n(Trum the Special Corrcsjmnlent of the Standard.) \\\\\\nTUE European Consuls have been so profoundlj\\' im-\\npressed by the misery of the refugees, who are\\ncrowded together in Constantinople, and are, more-\\nover, so apprehensive that the epidemics which\\nhave already made their appearanco amongst us\\nwill increase in intenbity and fatality, that they\\nhaye met for the purpose of considering how the\\nexisting and yet impending evils niny best be\\naverted. It is believed that they will urge the\\nGovernment to adopt some such plan as that which\\n1 am about to describe. They will recommend that\\nfor the purpose of restoring the refugees to their\\nhomes, or where that cannot be done, for the purpose\\nof sending them into Asia, the Government shall\\nobtain an advance of from \\xc2\\xa3200,000 to \\xc2\\xa3250,000 from\\nthe local bankers ; and that with a view to give the\\nlocal bankers due security for the repoj-roent of the\\nadvance, tilo dutj\\' on all goods passing through the\\nCustom-house shall he raised from 8 per cent.-the\\npresent uniform rate-to 10 per cent., the additional\\n2 per cent, being applied to the payment of the\\nadv ance. They will also propose that the \\xc2\\xbbum raised\\nfor tile benefit of the refugees Bhall ho administered\\nbj- a mixed European Commission. The scheme is\\nexcellent. The additional tax is not great, and it\\nwoidd bopaid chiefly by the well-to-do classe\\xc2\\xbb. The\\nmoney raised would be well and even remuneratively\\nexpended, since it would be expended in the transport\\nof labour to the fields which are almost denuded of\\nthose who should till them. Constantinople would\\nthus be relieved of a very great aud pressing danger.\\nBut I do not think it is at all probable that\\nthe scheme can he carried out. The existing\\nCustoms duties are established under treaties with\\nforeign Powers, and even if European diplomacy\\ncould be induced to reconsider those treaties\\nwith a view to their amendment, it would\\nhardly complete its task in the lifetime of the\\nrefugee\\xc2\\xbb. I fear that to the greater part of these un-\\nfortunates the grave alone can bring relief. I see\\nmuch of them, and the more I see of them, the more I\\nam impressed by their patient, and even cheerful,\\nresignation under trials which daily become more and\\nmore intense. The situation is always becoming worse,\\nfor the conduct of the Bulgarians is such that none of\\nthe Mahometan refugees will return to their homes,\\nwhilst most of the Moslems who have not already left\\nBulgaria, aro preparing to fly from the brutality of the\\nSlavs. In addition to this, an exodus is now\\ntaking place from Epirus and Thessaly, so we aro\\nlikely to be overwhelmed by a fresh crowd of \\'fugi-\\ntives. Meanwhile, the Porte continues to bring fresh\\nrecruits to the capital, in which, and in the neighbour-\\nhood of which, there are now one hundred and eighty\\nbattalions of Turkish soldiers.\\nThe dissensions among the Ministers have arisen to\\nsuch a height that the Administration is paralysed,\\nand nil business stands still, while the partisans of\\nRussia and those of England struggle for the\\nmastery. I ara told that yesterday the Council had\\nunder consideration n fresh Note from Russia,\\nmaking a final demand for the strategical position\\xc2\\xbb\\ndescribed in my previous letters, and that it had\\nalso under consideration a counter Note from\\nEngland, protesting against the cession of these\\npositions to Russia, and stating that if they were\\nceded it would he necessary to take immediate\\nmeasures for the protection\"of English interests\\nagainst the combined hostility of Turkey and Russia.\\nThe Council could como to no decision with regard to\\nthese note\\xc2\\xbb, and when it broke up Mehmed Ruchdi,\\nwho has recently been made a Minister without a\\nportfolio, and who is expected bj- some to replace\\nAhmet Vefyk, proceeded to the Sultan to inform him\\nof the subject which the Council had had under con-\\nsideration. The Sultan, in the hope of gaining time,\\nproposes to ask the mediation of the French Ambas-\\nsador, but the strategical positions which Russia and\\nEngland demand are so important to cither nation,\\nthat the mediation of the French Ambassador is net\\nlikely to be effectual. At the same time, the conduct\\nof Austria gives the Porte other causes for uneasiness,\\nAustria demands to be allowed to occupy Bosnia and\\nthe Herzegovina, avhere the insurrection has assumed\\ndangerous proportions, and is preparing to move her\\ntroops. The Porto refuses the required permission,\\nand throws on Austria the responsibility of the\\ndisastrous consequences which must follow from the\\noccupation. This, however, is not likely to prevent\\nthe occupation. Lastly, Italy is taking a very\\nlively inteicst in the insurrection in the Greek pro-\\nvinces, and is showing phainly her fixed determina-\\ntion to be present when the time arrives for the\\npartition of Turkey. Under these circumstances, the\\nRussian party gains strength &\\xc2\\xbbily, and -will probably\\ntriumph. The Sultan and the Pachas are clinging,\\nnaturally enough, to their capital, and will do any\\nthiiiE it only tiley may retain their hold upon it.\\nApparently the Russians are far f rombeing unwilling to\\nallow the Sultan to have a further tenure of power in\\nConstantinople, and they are thus in a position to bid\\nattractively for a Turkish alliance.\\nI had written thus far when the news was brought\\nto me that all Mr. Layard\\'s efforts to maintain Ahmed\\nVefyk in power have failed. Sadyk Pacha is named\\nPrime Minister, andtheSheikK-id-Islamhas asobeen\\'\\nreplaced by Molah Bay. It seems to me that these\\nchanges point to a Russian, alliance., and.\\xc2\\xbb Hussion,\\n(occuja&ujjfionstantmctDleA.\\'.,'\n",

      " 'MILL\\'S DISSERTATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS.\\n{From the London Review.)\\nONE of the most remarkable facts which the\\nhistorian of the future must take into account\\nin estimating the forces that have governed\\nprogress in our age and country is, in spite of\\nMr Buckle, the individual influence of a great\\nman. At whatever department of thought we\\nglance, we distinguish, by comparison with the\\nconditions of twenty years ago, the unmis-\\ntakable stamp of one mind. Within the period\\nnamed, the experiential school of philosophy,\\nwhich had almost disappeared from the country\\nof Locke, driven out by a crude deluge of\\nGerman transcendentalism, has been raised\\nalmost to scientific perfection, has been formu-\\nlated, criticised, cleared of obscurities. In-\\nductive logic, since Bacon\\'s time practically\\nregnant in England, has vindicated as well a just\\nphilosophical supremacy The great problems\\nof social and intellectual freedom have been\\nboldly shaped into a grand code of tolerance, to\\nwhich even bigots are now compelled to yield\\nat least a lip worship Among our public men\\nand writers a broader view of responsibilities,\\nclass pretensions, and national claims has begun\\nto prevail Both in theoretical and practical\\npolitics the narrow selfishness, which aped\\nUtilitarianism but was really its antithesis, has\\nbeen to some extent discarded and now, if we\\nhave not quite escaped the taint of party bitter\\nness in political discussion,we have at all events\\nthe gratification of seeing that the number is\\never increasing of thinkers and even statesmen,\\nwho set philosophy above intrigue and petty\\nprivate interests On the whole we are\\njustified in the boast - though we see\\nmore promise as yet than performance\\nthat this generation is less the slave of\\nprejudices and formulas, more earnest, more\\nthoughtful, more logical than that which imme-\\ndiately preceded it It would be difficult to\\nover-estimate the share in this distinct and\\nwelcome advance which is due to the personal\\ninfluence of Mr John Stuart Mill.\\nMr Mill\\'s earlier appearances as an anony-\\nmous wrnter were of a very varied kind\\nPoetry, history, and fiction, were among the\\nsubjects of his keen impartial criticism But\\nafter the publication of his great works on\\npolitical economy and logic, wc find that he\\nlimits his labours to the severer walks of study,\\nin which he has become illustrious is an\\nauthority \\'Hie third volume of his collected\\nessays, which lies

and\\nrevolutionary, we shall find in Mr Mill\\'s system\\nthe most admirable type of modern develop\\nment Where the political economy of others\\nis hard anti narrow, his takes a broader view,\\nand docs not arrogate an irrational dominion\\nover the higher instincts of human nature\\nThus we find that ulonc, after Adam Smith, Mr\\nMill has put Ins favourite science into i form\\nnot repulsive to those bene\\'olent aspirations\\nwhich no science can extinguish in man In\\nthe same way he has softened down the harsher\\ntraits of the utilitarian philosophy, as it derived\\nitself from Bentham In politics, the tin\\nRadicalism of his fathtr, James Mill, and his\\nschool, has been vivified and informed with i\\nnew soul by that noble chapter in the \" Political\\nEconomy \\' on \\' \\'1 he Probable Futurity of tne\\nLabouring Classes, \\' by the \" Essay on Liberty,\\nand the \\' Representative Government\" And\\nthose students ol mental philosophy who wotilel\\nhave rejected the gross materialism of Hartley\\nand Condillac can recognise in the refutation\\nof Hamilton a metaphysical theory which\\nneither revolts the logical sense nor the\\nspiritual nature It is this apt combination of\\nthe strictest principles of individualism with a\\ngenerous enthusiasm for everything that is just\\nand noble, which has gained for Mr Mill his\\nwide and potent sway over the mind of\\nEngland Resting as that sway does, on the\\nfree allegiance of the mest enlightened and the\\nmost ardent spirits among the younger genera\\ntion of Englishmen, it must, beyond question,\\nbe extended and strengthened with mere lapse\\nof time How far this philosophy can be con\\nsidered an ultimate growth admits of more\\ndoubt It ein only be supplanted, however, ii\\nat all, by a system based on the solidarity of\\nmankind, and on theories which only a few\\nthinkers in this country regard as other than\\nhopeless unattainable dreams\\nAlmost cvtiy page of ihe volume befoie us\\nfurnishes us with in example of Mr Mills\\npower over opinion To him is due the grow-\\ning interest felt by the public in Mr. Hare\\'s\\nscheme of personal representation, and the\\nglowing toleration accoided to its discussion\\n\\'lins plan is very cekariy the very apothcosis of\\nindividuihsm in the domain of practical politics,\\nand, as such, will never meet with the approval\\nof those who regard rather the action of the\\npopular will through masses than the divlsion of\\nthe State into little groups of personal interests\\nIt is so very improbable that we can go so far in\\nthe wat of recasting our institutions as to adopt\\nMi Hare\\'s ingenious machinery, that the ques\\ntion is practically taken out of the sphere of\\nuseful debate, since we believe even Mr Mill\\nhimself, in bringing it under the nonce of the\\nHouse of Commons, rather desires to assert\\nthe principle than hopes to establish the\\nactual change A more real benefit, in our\\npresent effort to complete some satisfactory\\nrepresentative Reform, may be derived from\\nMr Mill\\'s sensible statement of the advantages\\nof grouping, in a redistribution of seats Wh lt\\never ma) be the fate of the fianeluse clauses of\\nthe present Government Bill, no one believes\\nthat Mr Disraeli\\'s redistribution plan has an)\\nchance ol fav omable acceptation In this\\npoint, however, the scheme of last year was\\nvery little better, and was open to all the ob\\njections which Mr Mill ably urges against\\nLord John Russell\\'s Bill of 1852 in view of\\nsome probable modifications of the grouping\\nsystem being proposed by one or other party,\\nthe following remarks on the radical vice of\\nprevious propositions will be found interest-\\ning -\\n\" \"i et, if the principle of

Later events\\nhave shown still more clearly that the\\nwhole\\'Question requires, to, be more carefully\\nlooked into, and that contingencies may aribe\\nwhich,involve doubt as to whether they have\\nbeen adequately (as they have not been ex-\\npressly) .forseen and provided for.\\n- Ihe difficulty in Ifew South Wales arose\\nfrom doubts as to whether the telegram from\\nthe Secretary of State, which the Govern-\\nment interpreted as \\'constructively sanctioning\\ntheir arrangements,<,was sufficient to cure tha\\nomission on the part of the Queen\\'s instruc-\\ntions or commission to provide expressly for\\nthe absence of the \\'Governor during a longer\\nperiod than a month without \\xc2\\xbfailing in ai\\nActing-Governor to take his place. The\\ndifficulty in Victoria was not as to the\\nswearing in of Sir Redmond Babiiy. That\\nwas disposed of by the force of circumstances\\nwhich left the Ministry but one course to\\nfollow. The difficulty there arose from tho\\nabsence of the Chief Justice (the Acting-Go-\\nvernor designate) at the time when an Acting\\nGovernor had to be sworn in, and from his\\nreturn whilst the duties of the office were being\\ndischarged by the senior Judge, the official\\ndesignated by the commission to take the\\noffice if the Chief Justice were ab.ent.\\nWas Sir W. Stawell, the Chief Justice, to\\nassume the Acting-Governorship on his return,\\nor was Sir Redmond Baeiiy, in whom the\\npowers of Governor were legally vested, to\\nretain and exercise them ? Doubt was felt\\namongst the lawyers as to whether the power*\\nof the commission under which Sir Redmond\\nBakey had been appointed were not exhausted\\nbj his appointment. These doubts, however,\\nwere overruled. Sir W. Stawell was sworn\\nin on the 11th, Sir Rldmond Bakry art\\nministering the .oaths. And it is said that in\\nthe event of any embarrassment occurring,\\na telegram will be sent to London, asking for\\n[the execution of a fresh commission.\\nAs this is cutting the Gordian knot, instead\\nof untying it-a process thati may be ver)\\n\\xc2\\xa1agreeaole to ,\\'Ministries tin Victoria, but is\\nhardly excusable\\' on constitutional \\'principles-~\\nthe difficulty remains still undisposed of. Let\\nus, then, inquire into its nature more closely,\\nThe Argus describes Sir W. Stawell as\\n\" assuming \" the administration of the Govern-\\nment, But how was it possible for hira to\\nassumo it ? Did Sir Redmond Barry give it\\nup, or was it taken from him, or did it pass\\nfrom him by the operation of the commission? I\\nThe last supposition is untenable. If Sir\\nGroROE Bowen had leturned before Sir W.\\nStawell, this sort of self-acting transfer i\\nwould certainly have taken place. Sir Red- I\\nmond Barry having become Acting-Governor\\nduring the Governor\\'s absence only,- the\\nGoveinor, in viitue of his own commission^\\nwould have resumed his full powers on te\\nentering the territory of Victoria aB a matter of\\ncourse. Sir George Bowen was Governor\\nbefore he left, was Governor whilst absent, and\\nwould have been Governor on his return, his\\ncommission having been neither cancelled nur\\nwithdrawn, but simply suspended as to its\\noperation during his absence. Not so with\\nSir W. Stawell. He \"assumed\" the ad-\\nministratorship ; he did not resume it, because\\nit was not his to resume. He had not held it\\nbefore. If he had held it before, and had then\\nleft the colony, and if Sir Redmond\\nBarry had then become administrator\\nin his place, there would have been\\nan analogy between the two cases, and Sir\\nW. Stawell might have claimed, like the\\nGovernor, the right to resume the powers\\nwhich by his absence he had become tempo-\\nrarily incapable of exercising. As it was,\\nwhen he reiurned, he returned as Chief Justice,\\nnot as Acting-Governor. He could not become\\nActing-Governor till he was Bworn in. He\\ncould only take office by assumption, not\\nby resumption, as Sir George Bowen\\ncould. Sir George Bowen, on returning,\\nwould have resumed power as Sir George\\nBowen in virtue of a personal appointment\\nby a commission still operative. Sir W.\\nStawell could neither reaBon1 nor assume aa\\nSir W. Siawell. lie had not been\\npersonally named in any commission. And the\\nonl} circumstances under which he could have\\nclaimed a right to assume the administratorship\\nas Chitf Justice-as the official designated to\\nfill the vacant office-were manifestly when the\\noffice wat, \\\\acant. But was it vacant? \\' !\\nAi Sir Rj.dmo\\xc3\\xaesd Barry was not absent on\\nSii W. t>TAWH.L\\'s return, and not suffering\\nIrom incHpucitv, a vurancy could not have\\nexistid unless he had been deprived of the\\noffice or resigned it. But, having taken the\\noaths, \\xc2\\xabho was.to deprive him of the office had]\\nlie chocen to hold it, adopting Marsh ii\\nMacMamon\\'s motto, \"J\\'y suts;j\\'y reslc\\'1\\'\"\\nHe could have held his footing in\\nthe Malakhofi\\' agnvnst anybody short\\nof the Secretary of Stnte. The sup;\\nposition, then, is that ho re_igned.(\\nBut will that resignation hold together on\\'\\nbeing shaken ? When Sir George Bowen\\nleft the colon), he did not resign the Gover-I\\nnort-hip. He simply went away, and left the\\noffice to fall into the hands of the official first\\nI in rank designated to fill itj\\' whensoever\\n\\'hat official should he duly eworn in J\\n[ But Sir Redmond Barky did hot go away.]\\nIf he resigned, he resigned and still\\nremained, able, if not willing, to discharge the\\nduties of the office. But had he the powei\\'\\nthus to resign and remain? He_ was, bo to,\\nspeak, seised of the business of administration,\\nand had he a right of his own motion to relieve\\nhimself of it, and hand o\\\\er his duties to\\nanother who, bo long as Sir Redmond was\\nActing-Governor, was his subordinate ? If Sir\\xc2\\xa1\\nGeorge Bowen had resigned he would have\\'\\nsent in his resignation to his superior officer,)\\nthe Secretary of State, and have awaited\\nhis reply. Sir Redmond Barry, derivingj\\nhis authority as Acting-Governor from the\\nsame source, could presumably resign it only\\nin the same manner. Resignation, apart from\\nsupervening incapacity, implies a reference^\\nto an authority competent to accept or decline\\xc2\\xab\\nit. But there was no such authority in Vic-\\ntoria in Sir Redmond Barry\\'s case. He\\ncould not tender his resignation to the j\\nMinistry, for their status was not superior;\\nto his own. When once he had been,\\ns worn in, they were rather under his\\nauthority than he under theirs. He could not\\ntender it to Sir W. Stawell, of whom\\nas defacto Governor, whilst Sir W. Stawell,\\nwas only Chief Justice, he took precedence.\\'\\nOn the whole, the theory of resignation seems\\nas little tenable as that of transfer by the mere\\nforce of the commission, which, if our reasoning\\nbe correct, could only have taken place if Sir1\\nW. Stawell had been the Acting-Governor,\\nfirst sworn in, and had returned after a tem-*\\nporary absence, during which Sir Redmond i\\nBarry had been his hourn (mens. A j\\nvacancy might have been created readily]\\nerpugh, ifSir Redmond Barry, who is now I\\nin New South Wales, had arranged for an\\'\\nearlier i isit, and quitted Victoria the day before \\'\\nSir W. Stawell\\'s arrival, or if the Govern-\\nment had delayed swearing in Sir W.\\nStawell until after his departure. But he\\nremained, and the question is, how while he\\nremained could the office become legally\\nvacant ? \\'\\nIt appears to ,us that, just as it was only\\nthough the absence of Sir W. \\'Stawell\\nwhen an Acting-G o vernon ,was required, that\\nSir Redmond Barry obtained the office, bo,\\nwhen Sir\\'Redmond Barry had once obtained\\nit and been duly sworn in, it was only by his\\ndeparture from t the colony, or by supervening\\nincapacity, that Sir W. Stawell could rightly\\nassume it. \\' Sir Redmond Barry became\\nActing-Governor because the swearing\\nin of an Acting-Governor was requirod\\nby , the public interest. But no such\\nnecessity aroBe. on the return of Sir\\nW. Stawell, because the office had been\\nfilled and itB duties were being discharged\\' in\\nthe manner provided hy the Royal Instructions\\nund Commission. The provisions of the Com-\\nmission and the Instructions were intended to\\nshow how a vacant office was to be filled, and\\nnot, when the office had been duly filled, to\\ncreate a vacancy in order to substitute another\\nofficer for the one in whom the powers attach-\\ning to the position legally vested.\\n\\\\ Wir at a mine of wealth there would be in the\\n\\\\inej aids of Australia if only we had a market\\nI under our lee, such as France has in Europe.\\nI\\'the day may come perhaps when in America,\\n\\xc2\\xa1if not in Europe,, Australian wines maybe a\\npopular drink, but at the present time the costs\\n\\'of production and carriage aVe against us, and\\ndhe reputation \\'of our vineyards and wine\\nicellsrs is not high enough, and in the main the\\n! market for Australian wines is still in Aus-\\ntralia. *\\nj As some compensation for the disasters it has\\n\\'latelv undergone, France was last year blessed\\nwith an unusually splendid vintage. Notwith-\\nstanding the oidium, notwithstanding the\\n\\xc2\\xa1phjlloxera, and notwithstanding hailstorms,\\n\\'the vintage was productiv e to an extent which\\nhas only once been equalled, and that was in\\n\\xc2\\xa1the year 18G9. The produce is estimated at\\n170,000,000 of hectolitres, and sr a hectojitre ;s\\nTwentr-two-1-4 gallons,\" tt\\xc3\\xadiB\\'Ms \"s equal1\\'* to\\'\\n1,540,000,000 gallons. The growth of\\nthe trade out of which France makes\\nso much money will be visible by |\\nnoticing tViat in 1854, that is only twenty years\\nago, the product was only eleven millions of\\nhectolitres; in tho following year it rose to\\nfifteen; during the eleven years from 1863 to\\n1878 inclusive, it rose to an average of fifty\\nthree millions ; \"but in 1873, which was a very\\nbad j ear, it dropped to thirty-six millions, and\\nnow, in the following year, it is very nearly\\ndouble, hating risen to seventy millions.\\nThere are only ten departments in France\\nwhich produce no wine, and the vine covers\\n4} per cent, of the whole surface of the\\ncountry, or in round numbers about five million\\nacres. There are, however, three chief wine-\\ngrowing districts, namely the Bordelais, Bur-\\ngundy, and Champagne, and the produce from\\nthose districts has not yet been rivalled by any\\nother part of the world. The number of\\npeople employed in thia industry is in propor-\\ntion to the acreage covered, for it is reckoned\\nto give occupation to no fewer than seven\\nmillion labourers ; that is to say, one industry\\nin .France alone, and that an industry which\\nproduces an article of luxury, finds wages for\\nmore than three times the whole population of\\nAustralasia. \\'\\nNor is there any fear at present of France\\nover-producing. There is an indefinite market\\nfor all the good wine that is made, although it\\nis possible that a great or sudden glut might to\\nsome extent lower the price, in order to allow\\n.-?ales to be effected rapidly. But in its wine\\nFiance has an article which tbe world\\neagerly buys ; and, as the world is grow-\\ning richer every year, and becoming more\\nand more luxurious, there is more and\\nmore eager demand for wines of the\\' best\\nquality. In this way, France is taxing the\\nwhole world to help it to pay its debts ; and\\neveryone who sips his claret or his champagne\\nassists towards the pa} ment of that satisfaction\\'\\nwhich Bismarck and Von Moltkk exacted. <\\nIt is impossible not to notice in this yield of\\n(he French vineyards how much the commerce\\nof the world has gained by the greater humanity\\nof modern methods of war. When we read\\nancient history, we hear of conqueTorB who\\n..eemtd insatiable in their revenge, who razed\\ncities to the ground, and who ploughed up the\\ncultivated fields and sprinkled them with salt.\\'\\nand who seemed never to be able to do enough\\nlo tatisfy themselves that the people who had\\npiovoked their wrath should be ruined hope-\\nlessly. If the samo spirit had animated modern\\nwar-if the Germans, not content with conqu_\\nluig, had sought only to devastate-if they,\\nhad pulled up the vines and destroyed\\nthe wine-presses, in how different a\\nsituation would France have been! How\\nheavy would have been the pressure of\\nthe taxation, and how cramped the resources\\nlo meet that taxation. What numbers would\\nhave been out of employment, and what years\\nwould have been waited by capitalists till vines\\ncould have been replanted and again become\\nproductive ! But, as it was, the German occu-\\npation did. not appreciably affect the vintage,\\nwhich even, during the disastrous year of th\\xc3\\xa7\\nwar kept up its\\'\\'average. <** * ,\\nIt is quite true that this more humane pian\\nmils the conqueror quite as well as it suits* thfct\\nconquered. The victor takes it out in monej\\ninptead of having his payment in revenge. lV\\nGeimany had destroyed the productive industij\\'\\nof France, it would have had to content itself\\nwith a far smaller indemnity. The credit of\\nFrance would have been too prostrate for it io\\nhave raised the necessary loans with the\\'\\npromptness that it did, and Germany i1-\\'\\niewar.de,d for not having destroyed French \\xc2\\xa1\\nvineyards by the receipt of hundreds of million\\xc2\\xab\\nof French gold. Doubtless to a Christian\\nspiiit this mode of re\\xc3\\xad enge is more satisfactory,\\nand to the wine-drinkers of the world it is moie\\nsatisfactory also.\\nIt is impossible also in connection with this\\nsubject not to notice how much of the wealth \\',\\nof France is due to it being a producer for the\\nluxury of the world. In the way of exporting\\nthe necessaries of life it does not do mucn,.\\nand produces mainly for its own popu-\\nlation. It exports but little of com\\' or of\\nmeat ; but with regard to all that comforts the\\nstomach or adorns the person, France stands\\nin the first rank of producers. It is the grand\\npurveyor of luxury, and, in a world that is\\ngetting every year richer and more luxurious,\\nit does not fail to find a splendid market.\\nFrance, though it has no monopoly of the busi-\\nness in luxuries, has the undisputed lea-1.\\nItaly provides many objects of art, and English\\nmanufacturers are improving yearly in tbiii\\nproductions of taste and ingenuity. Still it is to\\nFrance that the world turns for models and foi\\nits choicest objets de luxe; and there seems no\\nlikelihood \\' of its pre-eminence in this depart\\nment being interfered wi li. The French\\nmanipulators seem to have as great an aptitude\\nfor work of this sort as their soil and climate\\nhave aptitude for a special class of wines. The\\ncommercial position of France in these respects\\n| brings it wealth, in spite of all its foreign wai s\\nand its intestine discords, and of the damage in-\\nevitably done to trade when capital is alarmed\\nby insecurity and labour is oppressed bj\\ntaxation.\\nTub Vatican Decbees.-AVe print to-day, on\\nthe sixth page, the first part of the Right Hon.

      " 'ODc \\xc2\\xa3fiUneg ifloni\\xc3\\xadits pe\\xc3\\xadala.\\nWEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 137C.\\nIn yesterday\\'s issue avo published a letter of\\nMr. CnACKNELi/s on the second cable question.\\nThe letter, as our readers Avili have observed,\\nalthough addressed to the Government of this\\ncolony, comes to us by AA\\'ay of Victoria. On\\nseveral occasions during the last, few months\\nwe have been indebted to Victorian sources of\\ninformation for the official correspondence of\\nNoav South \"Wales. Matters Avithheld from\\nthe public by our own Government are com-\\nmunicated to the Government of tho neigh\\nI bouring colony. By that Government they\\naro sent to the Press, and in this way, in\\nregard to the cable question at least, we have\\ngot to know Avhat is going on in ofticial\\ncircles in Ncav South Wales. We are not\\naware whether this anomalous state of\\nthings is attributable to too much communi-\\ncativeness in the one Government or to too\\nmuch reserve in the other. It is, however, a\\nstate of things which can scarcely bo said to\\nbo satisfactory.\\nAnything that relates to the improvement\\nof telegraphic communication between these\\ncolonies and the mother-country is just now of\\nthe utmost importance, and if there is any in-\\nformation in the hands of the Government in\\nregard to a great question of this lund, the i\\npeople of this colony are, to Bay the least, as\\nfully entitled to it as the people of Victoria.\\nWe have no wish to contend for the publica-\\ntion of private documents. A large section of\\nthe correspondence that passes through the\\nhands of a Government is judiciously with-\\nheld, at least temporarily, from the public.\\nThere are also documents which may be Avisely\\nsent to the Government of another colony\\nand as wisely kept from the people of\\nthis colony ; and as to what documents should\\nbe regarded as private and what as public the\\nGovernment itself must be the primary judge.\\nIt is not too much, however, to insist that\\nthere should be a proper xinderutanding and a\\nproper agreement between Governments like\\nthose of Victoria and New South Wales, and\\nthat any departure from the agreement on\\neither side should be made the subject of\\nimmediate inquiry. We certainly cannot see\\nanything in Mr. Cracknkll\\'s lost communi-\\ncations that should necessitate their being\\nconfined to diplomatic circles. But, on the\\nother hand, such things cannot be claimed\\nby the public as a right. If these\\nand other communications have. been\\nsent to the Government of Victoria as\\nprivate documents, the Government of this\\ncolony has sufficient ground to complain of\\nbreaches of courtesy and of trust. If stich\\ndocuments are public, and not priA\\'ate, the\\npublic of the colony to which they aTe sent\\nought not to be dependent on Victorian\\nchannels of intelligence for a sight of them.\\nUnder any circumstances, it can hardly be\\ndeemed satisfactory that we should be\\ndependent upon the Government of another\\ncolony for a knowledge of Avhat is being done\\nby the agents of this colony to increase the\\nmeans of telegraphic communication between\\nAustralia and the rest of the world.\\nIt is certainly matter for congratulation\\nthat Mr. Cracknell is so fully devoting his\\nleisure time to the task of duplicating the\\ncable ; and in one point, at least, Mr.\\nCracknell\\'s last letter reports material pro-\\ngress. The letter of Lord Caknahvon,\\nwhich reached us a Aveek or two ago, so\\nfar as we were able to understand it, sub-\\nmitted the cable from Rangoon to Penang as a\\nquestion, the settlement of which Avould be\\ndependent upon the decision of the colonies.\\nMr. Cracicnkll tells us that the new cable\\nI between thes9 two places has actually been\\nI shipped, and from this we may gather that\\nI this cable will be laid whether the colonies\\n| agree to pay the subsidy of \\xc2\\xa320,000 asked for\\nI or not. The object of the subsidy named is\\nthe reduction of the rates, and bo far as this\\n\\' part of the line is concerned, the colonies will\\nhave to choose between the payment of high\\nTates and no subsidy, and the payment of low\\nrates and a subsidy of \\xc2\\xa320,000 a year. Tho\\nEastern Extension Company has its own in-\\nterests to consider as well as those of the\\ncolonies, and ic is not improbable that the\\n1 company have already found out that business\\nconsiderations Avili compel tbem to construct\\nthe duplicate cable to Penang whatever the\\ndecision of the colonies may bo. Under any\\ncircumstances we may conclude, that in a\\nvery short time there will be a duplicato cable\\nbetween London and Singapore.\\nThe immediate question, \"according to Mr.\\n| Cracknell, is the -duplicating of the cable\\nI between Singapore and Banjowangie. This\\nwould remedy the evils of a very defective\\n1 section between Singapore and Batavia and of\\nthe Java land lines, which ave Avorked by ,\\nDutch operators. The distance ia about 1000\\nmile., and the subsidy risked for is \\xc2\\xa321,780,\\ninclusivo of interest and renewal. Mr. Crack\\nsru, thinks that tlio cabio from Singapore to\\nBaujowangio should ho arranged for at once,\\nI and about this there really ought not to be two\\nopinions. This is a part of the line that\\nspecially concerns the Australian colonies, and\\none that no company could bo expected to\\nestablish -without au Australian subsidy\\nMr Cuax\\'Kneli. thinks that a second cable\\nbetween Java and Australia is not a matter\\nof immediato importance, li it is found that\\nsuch a cabio is necessary, ho recommeuda\\nthat the duplicate lino should extend from\\nBaujowangio to North-West; Capo in Weston.\\nAustralia. Tho Eastern Extension Company\\noffer to construct a second Australian line,\\nconnecting at theso two points, and covering\\na distance of about 900 milos, for a subsidy\\nof \\xc2\\xa323,220. But Mr. C\\xc3\\xa4acknklt. think* that\\nprolonged interruption between Java and Port\\nDarwin is not likely to occur for flomo time,\\nand that a Becond lino this side of Java need\\nnot be undertaken for tho next few years.\\nWo hopo that tho Conference which is\\npromised for tho purpose of considering\\ntho whole question of a second cable will\\nbe of a different opinion. It is\\nnot likely that another interruption in the\\nDarwin-Banjo wan gie cable would ho as pro-\\nlonged as the one that commenced about eight\\nmouths ago ; but experience has shown beyond\\nall question that on greaC couti al lines a\\nduplicate cabio is absolutely necessary, if\\nthe cable is to bo relied upon for the transac-\\ntion of business of importance. Should we\\ncontent ourselves with one cable, wo may not\\nhave another interruption extending over four\\nor fivo months for a long time to come; but\\ntho liability of an interruption for a month, or\\neven a week, may, under critical circum-\\nstances, involve risks which aro too serious to\\nbe incurred, A second cable botween London\\nand nil the principal cities ol\\' Australia would,\\nunder any ordinary circumstances,, auswer all\\ncommercial and political purposes, but nothing\\nshort of this will suiflco.\\nFrom Mr. Chackmet.t/s tole_j;rara we\\nlearn that the Eastern Extension Com-\\npany are prepared to lay a second cable\\nbetwoen Singapore and Western Aus-\\ntralia for a subsidy of \\xc2\\xa34-\"3,0OO. This, it\\nseems, is submitted as a definite offer, and if\\nso the question to be decided by these colonie?\\nis whether this offer shull be accepted or\\nnot. The alternatives which present them-\\nselves are our lomaining as wo are, with the\\ninconvenioncies of a single cable, or the adop-\\ntion of another rouro altogether. Solar as we\\nare able to gather, the prevailing opinion in\\nVictoria is in favour of having the second\\ncable in the direction of the Mauritius or\\nCeylon. The duplicating of a cable on the\\npresent line is, however, the course that has\\nbeen advocated by the Government of this\\ncolony. Tins course is strongty urged by Mr.\\nOiiACKNTtLL, whose opinion in matters of this\\nkind is certainly entitled to respect The same\\ncourse ia urged upon tue colonies by the Im-\\nperial Government, and it is said tn_,t it is not\\nimprobable that that Government will as___t\\nin subsidizing a second cable between Singa-\\npore and Java.\\nShould the Australian colonies agree to\\naccept the terms of the Eastern Telegraph\\nCompany, there is no reason why Are\\nshould not have a second cable around the\\nworld in a very few months from the present\\ndate. The non-acceptance of these terms\\nwill, however, lead either to the postpone-\\nment of the whole quesltion, or to no\\ninconsiderable delay iu the settlement of\\nit. When the duplicate cable reaches Singa-\\npore it will be within less than 2000 miles\\nfrom the Australian coast. This is the\\nshortest route for the second cable,, and must\\nbe the least expensive. Objection\\xc2\\xbb may be\\nraised against our having a Becond cable on\\nthe same route as the fit st, but objjectkms\\nmore formidable may possibly be urged\\nagainst any other route that is suggested.\\nThe most natural and the most reasonable\\nproposition for securing a supply of an\\nincreasingly urgent public want is the one\\nthat is now before the colonies, and it would\\nbe well if some arrangement could b.e made\\nby which Mr. Cracknell could be kept ia\\nLondon until the terms for laying down a\\nsecond cable between Singapore and Australia\\nare actually agreed upon, and the work is\\nactually begun.\\nIn accordance with the provisions of the\\nSydney Corporation Restoration Act, eight\\naldermen o\\xc2\\xa3 the city of Sydney-being one\\nfor each ward-will go out of office on the 1st\\nof December next, and an election will take\\nplace in their respective wards to supply the\\nvacancies thus occasioned. The aldermen\\nwho go out by eftluxion of time, are, unless\\nspecially disqualified, capable of being re\\nelected. The present is therefore an exciting\\ntime in aldermanic and municipal circles.\\nOur readers are aware that the municipal\\nlaws which relate to the city, and the Act\\nwhich relates to municipalities generally\\nthroughout the colony, are separate and distinct\\nstatutes. The Act by virtue of Avhich the\\naffairs of the city are regulated is as remark-\\nable on account of ita incompleteness as are\\nthe municipal efforts of the city aldermen for(\\nthe want of appreciation of the importance of\\nthe duties which are entrusted to them. At\\nevery election we hear the cry that \" new\\nblood \" is necessary, and some frosli candidate\\nu damned with a fatal iiuency,\" comes forward\\nas a sort of municipal saviour, and promises\\nreforms without number. Hut after maldug\\none or two ineffectual straggles, ho becomes\\nas tamo as his municipal brethren, whose\\nprincipal object appears to bo to fix upon the\\ntreasury chest like so many horse-leeches.\\nThe two grand characteristics of the Sydney\\nMunicipal Council are a magnificent capacity\\nfor borrowing, and a patient endurance under\\ndeficient legislation\\' and ridiculously light\\ntaxation.\\nA seat in the City Council has been for years\\na sort of procrustean bed on which all alder-\\nmen of more than ordinary mental and moral\\nstature have been dwarfed to the proportions\\nof aldermanic mediocrity. It is time that this\\ncondition of things should be changed, and\\nas another opportunity is now presented to\\nthe ratepayers, we hope that they will have\\nsome regard to the importance of tho\\noccasion, and return men of sufficient in-\\ntellect to understand the position in which\\nthe city is placed, and Buf\\xc3\\xadicienfc inde-\\npendence and force of character to make\\ntheir influence felt. The city of Sydney\\ncannot go on much longer without fresh legis-\\nlation, it needs it quito as much as the sui\\nurban and country municipalities, and in\\nregard to the metropolis, of which Sydney is\\nthe contre, we must have a radical change.\\nNearly twenty years Lave elapsed since the\\nCity Corporation was restored, and the altera-\\ntion of circumstances which has taken place\\ndnriug that timo bus completely altered\" _,_\\ncondition of things. The suburbs have bl\\xc2\\xab!\\nas populous as the city; they have inter\\xc3\\xb3sea!\\n\\'\\xc2\\xa3 *ndf. .imPortant, and it i9 uot lik\\xc2\\xa3\\nthat m this now country thuy will corf\\nsent to the creation o\\xc2\\xa3 an anomaly like thnf\\nwhich exists in England in regard to It. chief\\ncity and its metropolis. And, further t__\\ntime is come wheu the reckless borrowin-of th\\ncity must bo checked, and whon al) tue\\xc2\\xb0muni\\ncipahties which con-tituto tho metr\\xc3\\xb3poli, ,naaI\\nbe placed upon an equal and (\"tiB\\xc3\\x8dao:\\xc2\\xab.^\\nfooting. \\'\\nWo do not think that the ratepayers oC\\nSydney havo heretofore exorcised th\\xc2\\xabj. \\xc3\\xb1i\\\\\\\\m<\\ncipal franchis, with very great discretion\\'\\nMon have been elected to represent the cHv\\nand ita Municipal Council who have not _eea\\nqualified either hy education or by natural\\ntalent. On tho contrary, many\\' person*\\nhavo boen elected who have ais\\nplayed little capacity for bu.ines\\xc2\\xbb, and have\"\\nbeen completely overwhelmed by the mngni.\\ntudo of the affairs which they have undertaken\"\\nto manage and control. It is R mistake to\\nsupposo that auy man will make an efficient\\nalderman, or ( that the best municipal repr\\xc2\\xab.\\nsentatives will be those who promise \"a\\nliberality which they do not exercise-towards\\ntheir own employes. The most objectionable\\ncandidates aro certainly those who have\\nindividual or relative \" axes to grind/\\' uni\\nwho seek to attain their own ends by 1:0.\\nCessions of profuso generosity. It ia desiriblj\\nthat those who a i-f elected to fill the municipal\\nofliee, both in Syduoy and the suburbs, should\\nbe men of independent character and vigorous\\nintellect-who are above log-rolling and the\\nlowest aldermanio nits ; who will not htmc ia\\nany power which will scenic to them a few\\nextra votes-who will not iuvolve the city in\\nlargo expenditure to promoto their own private\\ninterests, but who will endeavour\\'to carryon\\nthe municipal work on true municipal*\\nprinciples, and exercise their influence to\\nsecuro tboso r\\xc2\\xab Conns which are necessarv to\\npromote uumJeip.\\'J usefulness, Experience\\nhas already shown that municipalities areno\\'\\nto bo trusted with matters affecting the public\\nhealth, and that in order to secure an eftlcient\\nsystem of dtainage and water supply for the\\nwhoio metropolis, a Metropolitan Board of\\nWorks has become nu absolute necessity.\\nMunicipal duties thereforo will probably, it\\nno distant chite, be properly brought w_t_in\\na much more narrow compass.\\nA good many theories on municipal \"govern-\\nment have been set up by candidates for\\nmunicipal honours. We have sometimes heard\\n| people who aspire to the oflioo of alderman\\nexpatiate at considerable length upon th\\xc2\\xab sub-\\nject ol\\' loca) taxation generally, us xlioufb,\\nthey were about to be elected to a sxit in the\\nLegislative Assembly ^ Avheve tiley might hops\\nto give a vote for the purpose of determiniug\\nthi* important question. Occasionally casii\\ndates are eloquent on the subject of the eight\\xc2\\xab\\nhour question, in order to conciliate the support\\nof Corporation labourera and others. Some ate\\ngrear, upon the subject of municipal endow-\\nment , not as to the necessity o\\xc2\\xa3 increasing\\nthe c\\xc2\\xab.lnwment or otherwise, but U9 to the\\nmode in whioh that endowment ought\\nto be raised. rliie,> -want pnblicani\\'\\nlicenses, wine and spirit merchante\\' licenses,\\nauctioneers\\' licenses, the proceeds of the dog\\ntax, and in addition to all these they want \\xc2\\xbb\\nspecial endowment from the public Treasurr\\nof pound for pound extending over a number\\nof years. With thinse sources of income, the) \\xc3\\x8d\\nare of opinion that they could conduct tin\\nmunicipal business with great satisfaction\\nand financial success. They set forth a pro-\\ngramme so liberal as to draw forth unlimited\\napplause. But, after all, their opinions upon\\npoints of this kind are of very small conse-\\nquence. They cannot give any practical\\neffect to them as members of the Munici-\\npal Council, and the rate-payers will do\\nwell lo remember that they are no*\\nabout to elect men to perform purely\\nmunicipal duties, and not to take part\\nin legislation to amend the municipal law.\\nWe are clearly of opinion that the munici-\\npalities are entitled to a more liberal endc-i\\xc3\\xae-\\'\\nment, and that they ought to possess more\\nperfect and extensive powers of taxation. But\\nin connection with the present elections we\\nhave to consider, not how we can best secure\\nan alteration of the law, but how we can best\\nsecuro a proper administration of the law\\nwhich at present exists. We hope that this\\nwill bo borne in mind by the various rate-\\npayers, and that they will not give their votes\\nto mea whom they would not trust in private\\nlife, or to men whose mental capacity and\\nmoral status they hold in contempt.\\nTffE subject of forest vegetation and its effect\\xc2\\xbb\\non climate, dealt with by the Rev.

Tho ground of tho applica-\\ntion was that the order was not an oidor in which tho\\ndefendant promised to pay any amount. For tho pkintiff\\nit was contended that defendant\\'s order\\'was a guarantee for\\n(ho perfommncoof a contract taken by O\\' Brien from the Cor-\\nporation. Tho aflidavit of one of the\\' professional gontlomon\\nengaged in tho caso slated that tho Judgo had held thnt\\nthe order was a good and valid dooumont in law, and that\\nthat was the ground of the decision. With respect to tho\\n| order, his Honor held a different opinion, and a new trial\\nmust thcroforo bo granted. Mr. Gannon appeared in sup-\\nport of the application, and Mr. G. C. Davis opposed it.\\n\\xc3\\xaeiAvrs v. iionoiiGir OP PADDINGTON.\\nThe plaintiff in this caso h id been tho Council clerk to\\ntho borough of Paddington, and ho now sued the defendant\\nfor wrongful dismissal. He claimed \\xc2\\xa3160 damages. Mr.\\nPigott appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. S. C. Brown for\\ntho defendant. The agreemont undor which the plaintiff\\nserved tho Council provided that the engagement\\nmight be terminated by cithor party on a\\nmonth\\'s notice. Mr. Brown objected that tho\\nnew Municipalities Act conferred oxprosaly upon the\\nmayor of any borough power to diBmiss any of tho servants\\nof tho borough, and that it was not competent for the\\nCourt to review the mayor\\'s dotormination in that respect.\\nHis Honor was ef opinion, on the provision cited, that tho\\npower of suspension was delegated to tho Mayor, and that\\nthe power to dismiss rested with tho Council. He hold\\nthat it was competent for him to review tho dismissal by\\ntho Council. Tho evidence showed that tho plaintiff was\\nsuspended on the 9th of Juno, and that tho sus-\\npension was confirmed by tho Council al its next\\nmeeting, held shortly afterwards. Plaintiff\\'s testimony\\nshewed that tho mayor of tho borough (Mr. Taylor) told\\nhim that ho only suspended him because ho was askod_ to\\ndo so ; Taylor admitted that ho had no fault to find with\\nhim, and spoke highly of his efficiency, Messrs. Penfold\\nand Peate, aldermen of tho borough, gave evidence to the\\neffect that tho plaintiff had at all tunes performed tho duties\\nof his office in tho most efficient and satisfactory manner ;\\nwhile, on tho other hand, Aldermen Humphrey and Stone\\nstates that tho plaintiff had inaccurately kopt the minutes,\\nwithheld certain vouchers, whereby tho borough lost tho\\nGovernment endowment for tho half-year-that he had\\ndiEobcyed orders, and had been disrespectful to tho Mayor,\\nin practically calling him a liar on the occasion of a public\\nmeeting, and again at a meeting of tho Council. Theso\\nallegations were contradicted by the plaintiff. Tho minutes\\nof Council contained no record of the cause of plaintiff\\'s\\ndismissal, and tho only evidence on this point was in tho\\nvorbal report of the mayor, who thon stated\\nthat he had suspended the plaintiff because his\\nconduct was distasteful to a majority of tho\\naldermen, and because he bad no confidence in him.\\nMr, Taylor (the mayor of tho borough) sworo that ho did\\nsot dismiss Davis in consequence of any ill feeling, but\\nsimply becauso on ono or two occasions Mr. Davis had\\nasserted that he (witness) was a liar, and that Davis had on\\nmore than one occasion altered things in the account-books\\nin opposition to his (tho mayor\\'s) instructions. Ho was of\\nopinion that Davis was out of his mind at times. [At this\\nBtagc of tho caBc, his Honor intimated ho was of opinion\\nthat plaintiff had been wrongfully dismissed ; that\\nif there had not been any ill-feeling in exist-\\nence, plaintiff would never havo been dismissed.]\\nMr. Brown \\xc2\\xabintended that tho mayor of a municipality\\nhad the power to suspend a clerk or servant, at any time,\\nwho in his opinion was guilty of misconduct; such suspen-\\nsion, of courso, would bo subject to csnfirmation by tho\\nCouncil. In this instance, tho Council had confirmed tho\\nsuspension, that Davis had no right, boing a servant of tho\\nCouncil, to have attended any public meeting of tho rate-\\npayers, and; that Davis, having charged the mayor with\\ntelling falsehoods was quito sufficient cause for his dismis-\\nsion. Tho utmost that could bo claimed by tho\\nplaintiff was,\" a month\\'s pay. Mr. Pigott con-\\ntended that plaintiff was entitled to a year\\'s\\nsalary, tho contract having been for that period.\\nHis Honor was of opinion that he had jurisdiction to\\nconsider the question whether tho plaintiff hod been\\nwrongfully dismissed. He did not think that it was evor\\nthe intention of the Legislature that the Council clerk\\nshould be entirely at the meicy of tho Council, and should\\nbe deprived of all resort to a Court of law. As a matter i\\nof fact, he was of opinion that tho defendant had been\\nwrongfully dismissed by the Council. He was disposed to\\nthink that the plaintiff had shown a spirit of |\\npar\\'ialify, and had been guilty of conduct\\nwhich was unbecoming, and which would havo\\njustified the defendant in giving him a month\\'s\\nnotice ; but he did not think that that impropriety of con- j\\nduct was sufficient to justify his summary and absoluto\\ndismissal. He was of opinion upon the ovidenoe that tho\\nplaintiff had not been dismissed for misconduct, but becauso\\nhe did not givo satisfaction to a majority of the aldermen.\\nThe contract was for a year\\xc2\\xbf and that contract had not\\nbeen determined by the notice in writing required to be\\ngiven under it.

Loyalty,\\non the other hand, U a particularly\\ngross colt, and although he lias already\\n?bown himself to be something out of the\\ncommon, I fancy ho will not be seen at hi\\xc2\\xbb\\nvery best until later on in Ids career. He\\nwi 1, of course, be rjy.ite fit to race next\\n\\xc2\\xbbpring, but if his legs stand-and they cer-\\ntainly look a\\xc2\\xbb if they will-he will continue\\nto improve with age, and hi\\xc2\\xbb best perform-\\nances \\xc2\\xbbill probably be registered when be is\\nfour or five years old.\"\\nMr. H, K.

      " 'BRIGHAM YOUNG\\'S MESSAGE. \\'\\nTHE message of Brigham Young, delivered according\\nto the Salt Lake iVetci, \"orally, on Monday, Feb-\\nruary 22nd, to the Senate and House of Represent-\\natives of the State of DeBeret,\" at Salt Lake City,\\noccupies nearly one and a halt columns of that paper.\\nWe make the following extract :\\nWe have met in the capacity of a State Legislature\\nwith a view to preserve our organisation, and with an\\neye to the time when, in the wisdom of God, He will\\nmove upon the minds of Senators and Members of\\nCongrecs to give us oar legal, national, and legitimate\\nrights. We wait with patience to see this done.\\nPerhaps to some it \\xc2\\xabvould seem unnecessary to keep\\nup this organisation ; but it is that we may preserve\\nour identity as a part of the nation that we assemble\\nannually in this capacity. If the machinery\\nis kept in order, when the time shall come\\nfor the water to be turned upon it there will\\nbe no difficulty in starting it. It is not so much\\nto enact laws and to sit in a Legislative capacity that\\nwe now meet, as to recognise our rights ; and in\\ndoing so we do no more than others have done and no\\nmore than is our right to do. If we who live in this\\ncountry were disposed to meet in this capacity three\\nhundred and sixty-five days in the year, it would con-\\ncern nobody but ourselves, except meddlers and those\\nwho wish to infringe upon the rights of our neighbours.\\nIn a republican government like ours it is our right to\\nmeet as we do to-day. We have the undoubted right\\nto meet together and consult upon those points,of\\ngovernmental affairs that pertain to our future peace,\\nend to gather the necessary information to enable us\\nto proceed further in the\\'duties of life. Whether,lin\\nthe providences of God, we Bhall be admitted aa a\\nState or not we leave with him. He will do as He\\npleaseB ; the hearts of all living are in His hands, and\\nwhattver condition He permits us to live in we shall\\naccept and conform to. Gentlemen, in coming together\\nto-day as the representa\\'ives of Deseret, we have the\\nproud satisfaction of knowing that we represent a people\\ncapable in every respectif governing and controlling\\nthemselves. We in this country have achieved a\\nfreedom and independence such as are rarely pos-\\nsessed by any people in these days. We raise our\\nown bread and eat it ; we make our bridges and\\nstreets and pay fur them ; we erect our public\\nbuildings, develope our resources, sustain our Govern-\\nment and officers, and are not in debt. That\\nwhich is accumulated as income from taxation is\\nappropriated for the benefit of the people. We have\\nno bondB in market for greedy financiers to speculate\\nin, to prove a cause of embarrassment to ourselves\\nor a vexation and announce to our children. Our\\nlegislators have been wise enough not to go beyond\\ntheir ability, and burden the people with a heavy\\nindebtedness without having resources to refund the\\nsame. Should we be aelmitted as a State, I look for\\nthe snn.e policy to be pursued ; we shall\\nnot fall into debt, _ but always live within\\nour mennB. This is the secret of succesB\\nwith men, communities, and nations. Take men\\nin any capacity whatever, whether singly or\\notheiwisc, and you will find that if they live within\\ntheir means they will be independent and powerful.\\nIt is so in the case of a single individual, ana it is in-\\ncreased))- so with a community or nation. We, as a\\npeople, have had wisdom enough to perceive and act\\nupon this. A people or Government rtat will suffer,\\nitself to get entangled through avarice or other causes,\\'\\nand bring upon ita people war and indebtedness, and\\nthen poverty and distress, proves that it is not capable\\nof exercising the proper lights of government. But a\\nnation that can maintain peace within i\\'s borders and\\nwith its neighbours, exhibits knowledge, wisdom, and\\npower that muBt eventually call forth the respect and\\nadmiiation of the world. Thus far we have been able\\nJ .to piestive ourselves from such contingencies. It is\\ntrue that war has been made upon us ; but the sword\\nof indignation has fallen harmless at our feet. Yet\\no,ur own .wisdom did not produce this; it was by the\\npowtr and wisdom of God, which He imparts to those\\nwho live eo as to receive them that they may preserve\\nthemselves. j\\nON POVEBTV.-111 informed in political economy,\\nthe poor are worse informed in all matters of domestic\\neconomy. Having scant wages to live upon, they\\nrarely spend those wages in the most prudent and\\nprofitable wav s. They are too often the prey to their\\nown perverted tastes, and to the tricksters who trade\\nupon those tastes. They buy bad food, and cook it\\nbadlj ; their bodies ore dirty,\" their clothes are dirty,\\ntheir hcmeB are dirty. Disgusted thereby, and\\nafflicted by the hopelessness of their condition, it is\\nalmost a tule for them to stifle their feelings in un-\\nwholesome drink ; and thus they pass, from bad to\\nwoice. Every clergyman, every dector, every one who\\nknows anything of the dwellings of the poor, can give\\nus instances. without number of the waste\\nar.d unthrift that there abound. People whese\\nearnings are barely enough, with the strictest\\neconomy, to supply their most pressing needs;\\npractise no economy at all. Families that\\nhave, perhaps, twelve or fifteen shillings a, week\\nto subsist on, do not get more than eight or ten\\nshillings\\' worth of actual subsistence. The rest is\\nsquandered foolishly or viciously. For this the poor\\nthemselves are very little to blame, How can they\\nbe expected to do better when they have never been\\ntaught, when their cares are so overwhelming, when\\nthey have every inducement to despondency and\\nnone to hope ? Yet this is surely a matter in which\\ncharitable persons, charitable women especially, might\\nexercise their charity with unspeakable advantage.\\nMuch they do ; but very much more has to be done\\nbefe re any important change can be wrought in the\\neccnomic habits of our mulions of poor. So muoh\\nthat any thorough reformation must be despaired of,\\nunlees another branch of education-in correction of\\nthe third sort of ignorance here to be alluded\\nto, and the most ruinous of all-is also zealously\\npromoted. No great improvement in the con-\\ndition and prospects of the poor can be hoped tor\\nuntil they are taught to exercise ordinary prudence\\nin limiting the size of their families in accordance\\nwith their means of decently and healthily maintain-\\ning those families. Tbis \\xc3\\x8dB not the occasion for dis-\\ncussing the general question of Malfhusianism, as it\\nis called. The great law of population, first enunciated\\nby the Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus in 1798-that\\nwhilst, in the most favourable circumstances, the\\nfood-producing powers of land can only he expected\\nto increase in an arithmetical ratio, population always\\nUr.ds to incieaeo in a geometrioal ratio; and that\\naccordingly, unleBB the area of population can be\\nadequately extended, its proper growth U inevitably\\nrestricted by famine, plague, war, and other in-\\nvoluntary checks, if not by voluntary checks\\nresorted to by man himself-is SB simple and\\nir controve\\xc3\\xad tibie as the Newtonian law of gravition.\\nAt any rate, though many have ridiculed\\nit, and many more haTe ignored it, no one has\\never seriously attempted to controvert it. Multitudes\\nhave rejeced it without consenting to reason upon it;\\nbut all of the few who have reasonably considered it,\\nhave been ferced to adopt it. The precise bearings of\\nthe law and its detailed applications, however, include\\nmany problems that have yet to be settled. We do\\nnot vet know how rnanv inhabitants our own country,\\nfor instance, can be fairly expected to maintain in\\nthat measure of comfort which all human beings haye\\na right to claim ; nor have the possibility and ex-\\npedience of drafting off to other and thinly peopled\\ndistricts those of our offspring for whom there is no\\nroom in. the me ther country, been properly taken\\naccount of; nor have the special means by which the\\nlaw shall be ec forced been dulv investigated and\\ndefined. These questions and others like them are\\nworihy of careful consideration, and will have to be\\nconsidered before long. But we need not, and may\\nIneit, wait for that time before recognising the force of\\ntrc law in its relation to the present state of the poor. I\\n- Vndtrtht C\\'totcn. t\\nBALANCE OF-THE ANIMAL AND VEOBTAHLE KINODOMS\\nIN AK AQUARIUM.-In Chamber ft Miscellany we find\\nthe following :- In remarking .upon the result;\\nof his experiments, Mr. Warrington observes, \" Thus\\nwe have that admirable balance sustained between the\\nanimal and vegetable kingdoms, and that in a liquid\\nelement. The fish, in ita respiration, consumes the\\noxygen held in solution by the water as atmospheric\\nair, furnishes carbonic acid, feeds on the insects and\\nycung snails, and excretes material well adapted as a\\nrich food to the plant, and well fitted for its luxuriant;\\ngrowth. The plant, by its respiration, consumes the\\ncarbonic acid produced by the fish, appropriating the\\ncarbon to the construction of ita tissues and fibres\\xc2\\xab\\nand liberates the oxygen in its gaseous state to sustain\\nthe healthy functions of the animal life; at the same\\ntime that it feeds on the rejected matter, which has\\nfulfilled its purposes in the nourishment of the _ fish\\nand snail, end preserves the water constantly in a\\nclean and healthy\\'condition. While the slimy snail,\\nfinding its proper nutriment in the decomposing\\nvegetoble matter and minute confervoid growth, pre-\\nvents their accumulation by removing them ; and by\\nits vital powers\" converts what would otherwise act as\\na poison into a rich and fruitful nutriment, again to\\nconstitute a pabulum for the vegetable growth, while\\nit also acts the important.- part of a purveyor to its\\nfinny neighbours.\" This perfect adjustment in the\\neconomy of the animal and vegetable kingdoms,\\nwhereby the vital functions of each are permanently\\nmaintained, is one of the most beautiful phenomena\\nef organic nature. In the marine aquarium, the pre-\\nsence of molluscs is as necessary as in the fresh-water\\naquarium, to prevent an excessive growth of con\\nfen a.-, which otherwise soon make the water turbid\\nwitn their innumerable green seeds or spores, and\\nobscure the glass by establishing themselves upon it\\nin vast colonies. The common periwinkle, topshell,\\nand limpet are very suitable for this purpose.\\nTUB New York Tribune uses the tallest language in\\nreporting the ceremony of the 4th instant. Mr.\\nLincoln\\'s words are recalled as \" beautiful and elo-\\nquent,\" and \" the sad spectacle of a drunken Vice\\nPresident\" is flung at the back of the out-going\\nChief Magistrate. There is not much exaggeration in\\nthis ; indeed, it is not until the Tribune reporter\\narrived in the ball room of the Waite House that he\\nwiitCB \" high falutin.\" Then, possibly the united\\neffect of the scene and champagne induced him to pen\\nthe following rapturous description of the Inaugural\\nBall:-\"Thebrilliant scene presented within and with-\\nout the building, radiant in colour, glowing with light,\\nbrilliant like tropical flowers or the plumage of hum-\\nming birds, and ever shifting and varying like a many\\nhued and constantly-changing kaleidoscope. Fahr faces,\\nlovely forms, penetrant perfumes diffused as the\\nbrilliant robes moved about their wearers ; distin-\\nguished men, bearing names renowned in war, states\\nmanship, letters, and the other activities of our\\ncrowding life, clothed in the martial uniform, wearing\\nthe orders and diplomatic insignia of their own\\nsovereignties, or, better still, in the simple if sombro\\ndress of the American citizen ; all these and much\\nmore met and mingled here. Great waves of music\\npuh-ated along the heated and perfumed atmosphere,\\nand the witching mazes of the dance, and the moro\\nbewitching forms of the dancers-the ladies of coursa\\n-with all the brilliancy and beauty of colour and\\nfe rm, made up a scene worthy of pencil or pen*, yet\\nboth must fail in any attempt to render it fitly.\"\\nPOSITION OF THE WAK MINISTER.-The Royal\\nOlder which defines the relation of the Commander-\\nin-Chief to the Queen, the Army, and the War Office^\\nwas published on Saturday. Now that it has been\\nbiought to light, the discovery of the Sangraal should\\nnot be despaired of. Member after member of the\\nHouse of Commons has gone in search of it, blun-\\ndered, gone far astray, lost himself, and then re-\\nturned to sit down in dumb resignation. The jealousy\\nwith which its official guardians kept their secret, and\\ntheir blank complacent look while the representatives\\nof the public were stumbling about in the dark after\\nit, vveie admirable in their way, but they are now\\nthings of the paBt. The Order has become\\na public document, and now that it is\\nsubmitted to the judgment of the country we\\nexpect to hear no more of the dispute whether ^4\\nthe Army is or is not under a dual government.\\nThe Roj al Order, which is dated Balmoral, October,\\n1861-five years after the Duke of Cambridge had\\nbeen appointed to the chief command-defines the\\nposition of his Rojal Highness in no mere incidental\\nmssner. The purpose for which it was framed is\\ndeclared to be \"to prevent any doubts as to the\\npowers and duties of the Commander-in-Chief.\"\\nThe Order does not, however, set forth what those\\npowers and duties are, but after staling to what\\nthey relate-the government of the Army and the\\nadministration of military affairs-it directs that\\n\" they \\xc3\\x9fhall be excepted from the Department of\\nthe Secretary of State for War.\" A second para-\\ngraph of the Order completes the purpose of the\\ntim, by strictly appropriating to the Commander\\nin-Chief all the powers and business relating to the\\nmatters - aforementioned. The latter are \"to be\\ndeemed to belong to hi\\xc3\\x9f office,\" and to be ad\\nmini&teied, \"subject to our (the Royal) general\\ncontrol over the government of the Army, and to the\\nresponsibility of the Secretary of State.\" Responsi-\\nbility for what ? Of course not for the act of the\\nCommander-in-Chief, whose powers and duties are\\nexcepted from the Department of the Secretary of\\nState for War, but, as the* Order further explains,\\n\" for the exercise of our Royal prerogative in that -\\nbehalf, and subject to any powers formerly exercised\\nby the Secretary at War. No words could more\\nplainly mark out the position of a great and in-\\ndependent e fficer of the State, who has the power of a\\nMinister without a Minister\\'s responsibility. We do\\nnot now ask whether this is an objectionable arrange-\\nment, or the best that could be made ; we are only\\n\\'calling attention to the evidence of the fact. The\\nmeaning and intention of the Older are beyond\\ndoubt, and so far BB they go they are in derogation\\nof the principle of responsible government which\\nEnglishmen are sSipposed to value highly.-Daily\\nNeus.\\nTHE DECAY 01 THE HOUSE OI COMMONS.\\nIt is very unsatisfactory to find that before the new\\nHouses of Parliament have been fully completed, they\\nare actually decaying in parts ; and the same esti-\\nmates include votes for the building itself, and for the\\nappliances to arrest the progress of destruction. The\\nstone of which it is constructed was taken from a\\nYorks!: ire quarry on the recommendation of a com-\\nmission appointed to inquire into the subject, but\\nalmost immediately after being placed in position, this\\nparticular stone began to shew signB of decay. The\\nfacade of the building was marked by large patches,\\nand the Gothic tracery of the architecture was sadly\\ndisfigured. So far back as 1857 various processes for\\npreserving the stone were tried on different parts of the\\nbuilding, and subsequently Professor Faraday and Sir\\nRoderick Murchison were requested to give their opin-\\nions on the relative merits of such methods. They con-\\ncurred in awarding the pre-eminence to the process\\nof M. Szerelmy, of which the particulars are, of\\ncourse, a secret. Professor Faraday, in his report,\\nsaid that so far as a judgment could be formed upon\\ntwo years\\' experience, he believed that the process\\nwould sustain its character for a lengthened period, of\\ntime. \\'\\' I do not find,\" said the learned professor,\\n\"in other parts of the building,\" where M. Szerelmy\\'\\xc2\\xbb\\napplication is more than two years old, any signs of\\nexfoliation, or defection of the prepared face of the\\nstone, or any grounds for fear in that respect.\" The\\nprocess has been applied with equal success to the\\niron of the roof, which was deteriorating at an equally\\nrapid rate. Part of it had been coated with \\xc2\\xbbino or\\ngalvanized iron. This had scarcely been fixed when\\nit showed signs of preihature oxydation. M.\\nSzerelmy\\'s preparation was applied to one of the\\naffected parts, and also to the gilding of the clock\\ntower. On a careful examination last year, it was\\nfound that the portion treated with the preservative\\nmaterial was perfectly sound, while the rest of the roof\\nhad suffered more or less from atmospheric influences.\\nThe First Commissioner of Works has accordingly\\ndirected that the remainder of the roof should be\\ncovered with the composition. Meanwhile the stone-\\nwork shews signs of disintegration, and there is som\\xc2\\xab\\nground for the anticipation that, so far as external ap-\\npearances are concerned, the new Palace at West-\\nminster will shortly look as ancient as the venerable\\nAbbey, which reckons as many centuries as Sir\\nCharles Barry\\'s costly building can reckon years,\\nM. Szerelmy\\'s process is capable of application to\\nmany kinds of building materials. Experiments have\\nbeen tried on stone, brick, iron railings, and timber,\\nwith very gratifying results. Pieces of timber coated \\'\\nwith the preparation have been sunk for two year\\xc2\\xbb in\\nhe water at Portsmouth, and are now perfectly sound.\\nTextile fabrics are also rendered waterproof and in-\\ndestructible by it.\\nAr-pAux-iNo ENTERTAINMENT.-Mr. Howard Paul,\\nwho is always indulging in some form of eccentric\\nadvertising, announces in the Daily TsUgraph that he\\nwill give JE6 fur a short sharp title for hil Entertain-\\nment at St. James\\'s Hall.

Tho domo was burned in 1808, and circum\\nBtnnccB having given the Greeks a preponderance ia\\nPalestine, (hey profited by it to reconstruct tho church, to\\nhe exclufion ot tho Latins. In their turn they applied\\nthemselves to covering the monument vvith inscriptions\\nand images borrowed from their language and liturgy.\\n\"At present, Greeks and Latins confront oaeh other.\\nOno party demands tho reconstruction of the domo as it\\ninttcd before 1808 : tlio others demand a reconstruction\\n\\xc2\\xabTourinp; their olnim of possession or of vested rights,\\nino gi cat Powers, France and Russia, animated by the\\nttost hoDiurablo sentiments, havo sought to put an ond to\\nthose deplorable manifestations.

Tho distribution of the first mentioned\\nembraces 8 maximum periods of spots, of which 6 agree\\n. with the maxima of storms. Of 8 maximum periods, 5\\n\\' coincide with those of tho spots. Theso results agree witli\\n! those he obtained- for the hurricanes of the Antilles,\\ni Considering the difference of the phenomena, . and\\n1 that of latitude, this agreement points to cosmic\\nI influence. As regards the North Atlantic tempest\\xc2\\xab\\n\\'and gules, the minimum of instances correspondB tcf\\nthe maximum of spots in 1800, and tho maximum of in-,\\nstances to the minima of spots in 1867- M.

Though elected by the\\ndistrict meetings, the ministers cannot be looked\\nupon in every case as strictly representative,\\nbecause they did not give a statement ot their views\\nbefore their \\xc3\\xa9lection..

This ministerial com-\\nmittee, consisting of ministers appointed by the\\nConference and ministers electee! by the finan-\\ncial district meetings, will meet in London on\\nThursday, October 28. Sustentation funds havo been\\nreferred \"to in most of the financial district meetings,\\nthe object of them being to augment the stipends of\\nministeis in poor circuits to the sum of \\xc2\\xa3150 per\\nannum for each married minister. The movement is\\nprogressing in the following districts \\xc2\\xa1-Devonport,\\nNewcastle-on-Tyne, First London, Bristol, Liverpool.\\nManchester, Nottingham, Portsmouth, Bolton. In\\nthe Bolton district there is only one circuit giving less\\nthan \\xc2\\xa3150. In the Liverpool district it was reported\\nthat all the stipends were raised to the amount pro-\\nposed, and that \\xc2\\xa3120 had been sent to the general\\nfund. The Newcastle district, after meeting all\\nclaims, had sent to the general fund \\xc2\\xa3110. - Steps\\nare being taken for the formation of sustentation funds\\nin the following districts :-Cornwall, Leeds, South\\nAVales, Exeter, &c. Many of the districts have ar-\\nranged for special missions to be held in each circuit\\nduring the winter months. A special convention . of\\nChristian workers has been held in Birmingham, and\\none will shortly he held at Leeds. Arrangements are\\nbeing made for a large convention of AVcsleyan\\xc2\\xbb in\\nLondon,-\\'\\xc2\\xa1\\'he T/\\'w-\\xc3\\xaf,\\nEnglish v. Ammucak Watches. - Sir Edmund\\nBeckett, a scientific horologist, who is perhaps the\\nhighest English authority upon the subject, in his\\nwork upon \" Watches, Clocks, and Bells,\" says :\\n\"The liability of a watch, like any other piece of\\nmechanism, to require repair is in the ratio of the\\nnumber of separate parts which make up its unity1.\\nThe English watch, with its fusee and chain, ia com-\\nposed ot (\\xc2\\xbb38 more pieces than the American watch.\\nDispense with these G38 additional chances \\' of\\nbreakage, and it is easy to infer the superiority 0/\\nAmerican watches, in this one respeet at least. The\\nfusee and chain are_ rejected in the Waltham -waWh,\\nand the direct action of the mainspring adopted,\\nbecause the fusee and chain add giearly to the cost of\\na watch, and its tendency to injury, and are of\\'ne)\\npractical \\\\ alue for good timekeeping. This change is\\naelvocated on the ground that there is greater\\nsimplicity of action, less friction in the transmission\\nof motive power, increased facility for using a lighter\\nand more uniform spring, and more room for play iii\\nthe other parts of the movements.\" In support\"of\\nthis view (says the British Trade Jout nal), Sir Edmund\\nBeckett speaks very favourably of the American\\nprinciple of onlitting the chain. After alluding to\\nwhat lie calls the mischievous and common accidents\\nof chain-breaking, and noting the tendency of\\nadv \\xc2\\xa1meed watchmaking to do without, fusee and\\nchain, he says, \" Accordingly, both) in Switzerland\\nand America, which are gradually stealing away our\\n| common watch trade, the fusee and the chain aro\\nalmost univeisally omitted.\"\\n1'\n",

      " 'A GENERAL VIEW OF THE PRESENT\\nSTATE OF THE CHINESE EMPIRE.\\n(By the Special Correspondent of the Overland China\\nMail.)\\nHANKOW, 5th August, 1862.\\nTHERE is nothing in the present aspect of affairs\\nwhich promises the dawning of a more peaceful day\\nupon this distracted land. Ten long years have\\nelapsed since the beginning of these commotions;\\nand, for aught we can see just now, ten or twenty\\nmore are likely to follow ere they subside. Here\\ndynastic changes, like all other changes, move\\non very slowly ; they generally take from twenty to\\nforty years for their consummation. There are\\nno reasonable grounds for hoping that this\\nwill be accomplished within a shorter period. China\\nis what she has ever been\\xe2\\x80\\x94slow, stolid, stagnant;\\nand it is hardly fair to expect from her, in her dotage,\\nsigns of greater life and vigour than she was wont to\\ndisplay in the days of her much-vaunted strength. A\\nwell-instructed Chinaman, reviewing the events of\\nages gone by, sees nothing strange in all that is\\ngoing on around him. He looks upon the decade of\\nturmoil which has just passed, and anticipates the\\ncoming, too, as inevitable in the history of his nation.\\n\"These things needs be.\" Such is his reply to any\\nremark you may please to make on the judgments\\nthat are now shaking the very foundations of the\\nempire. In this he is doubtless right. Were it not\\nfor these frequent visitations, China would have sunk\\nlong ere this under the pressure of her accumu-\\nlated vices. This apparently destructive element\\nhas been the means of preserving the political\\nand social life of the people from entire extinction.\\nA Chinaman reasons more philosophically on the sub-\\nject than we seem capable of doing. We point to the\\npresent strife, and say, \"That is hell-born.\" \"No-\\nthing of the kind,\" remarks the Chinaman, \"it is only\\nan expression of the mind of Heaven.\" We pro-\\nnounce it poison ; the Chinaman calls it medicine.\\n\"It will convert your rich and fair country into a\\nbarren heath,\" observes the foreigner. \"No danger,\"\\nrejoins the Chinaman, \" it will only destroy the\\nweeds ; and when it is all over, we shall ring harvest\\nhome more loudly and heartily than we have done for\\nthe last fifty years.\"\\nLet anyone take Hankow (called by the natives the\\n\" Centre of the Empire \") for his stand-point, and\\ncalmly survey the surrounding provinces, and he will\\nhave some idea of the extensive disorder which pre-\\nvails, and of the utter impotence of the central\\ngovernment to cope with the evil.\\nSi-Chwan is to the west of us. This, the largest\\nand one of the finest provinces in the empire, is in a\\ncomplete state of anarchy. Shih-tah-kai, one of the\\nold followers of the \" Celestial King,\" is there with\\n400,000 men. Li-ta-ta is there at the head of a mil-\\nlion of men. The capital is reported to have been\\ntaken by him. Li-ta-ta is not connected with either\\nthe Tai-pings or Shih-tah-kai. He is setting up for\\nhimself, and hopes in due time to drive all parties\\nfrom the field. Though the number of his men is\\ndoubtless greatly exaggerated, still, to justify the ex-\\naggeration, it must be enormous.\\nKwei Chow and Yun Nan are also more or less\\nconvulsed.\\nThe news has just arrived at Hankow, that Shih-\\ntah-kai has passed over into Shen-si with a large\\nbody of men. This is regarded by the natives as a\\nsplendid move on his part. The province is famous for\\nits great merchants and wealth. The Imperialists\\nwill find it difficult to dislodge him from his mountain\\nfastnesses, if he is determined to hold them. He has\\nalso taken some places in the north-western parts of\\nthe province of Hupeh.\\nHonan is to the north of us. This province has\\nbeen the prey of the Honan Filchers for many years.\\nIn vain have the Imperialists tried to cope with them.\\nThey aim at nothing but plunder. They take a place,\\nremain in it as long as it affords them the means of\\nsubsistence, and, when thoroughly exhausted, they\\nbid it a temporary farewell. The mandarins have\\nlearned this, and act accordingly. Very seldom, or\\never they come into collision. The \"Fathers of the\\nPeople\" go out at one gate, and the filchers enter at\\nanother. When the latter retire, the former return, and\\nresume their places as the loving fathers of the people.\\nThese filchers are the men that defeated the famous\\nSun-kuh-ning-sin in several successive engagements\\nlast year, and ravaged the whole of the province of\\nShan-tung; they are the men that murdered Messrs.\\nHolmes and Parker. They are now threatening to\\npay a visit to Tien-tsin, and to do with the province\\nof Chih-li as they have done with those of Shan-tung\\nand Honan. The natives say that the Tai-pings are\\nvery angels compared with these incarnate demons.\\nThe province of Kiang-su and Che-kiang, and parts\\nof Ngan-hwei, are in the hands of the Tai-pings.\\nThey have evacuated several places of importance\\nwithin the last twelve months. To say that the Im-\\nperialists have recovered them, would be untrue.\\nMost of the cities on the banks of the Yang-tse had\\nbecome useless, or nearly so, to them. This will\\nprobably account for their giving them up so easily.\\nSince the foreign powers in China have thrown their\\ninfluence on the side of the Imperialists, these cities\\nhave become a source of weakness rather than of\\nstrength to their cause. Thousands of braves have\\nbeen passing under their guns in foreign ships, and\\nthey have not dared to put match to powder. All\\nthey could do was to gnash their teeth, shake their\\nheads, and swear vengeance. Nanking is being closely\\nbesieged again, and there is a rumour that the \"Celes-\\ntial King \" is thinking seriously of removing his\\nCapital. Should he do so, he will probably fix on\\nHangchow. That the Imperialists, single-handed,\\nwill be able to take Nanking, is out of the question ;\\nthat the chief may think it prudent to leave, from fear\\nof a visit from the English and French, is possible\\nenough. It is quite credible that within six months\\nthis noble city will cease to be the capital of the\\n\"Great Peace\" dynasty. What then? Will the re-\\nbels scatter ? \"Will their power be broken. Will\\nTaipingdom come to naught ? This is not probable.\\nTheir very existence and future prosperity depend\\nupon their adopting such a measure. In the interior\\nthey will be at a safe distance from our shot and shell,\\nand will be able to carry on their aggressive measures\\nwithout fear of interference on the part of the outside\\nnations. The probable result of such a retirement\\nwould be the extension of their operations into the\\nprovinces of Kiang-si, Fuh-kien, and Canton.\\n\"There is a vague rumour that the Yingwang (gen-\\nerally called the \" Four-eyed Dog \") has been cap-\\ntured by the Imperialists, or by Miau-pei lin, who\\nthreatens to hand him over to the Imperialists. If\\ntrue, the Tai-pings have lost their bravest general.\\nLike most rumours of the kind, however, it is likely\\nto turn out false.\\nAt Shanghae and Ningpo, the Tai-pings have\\nproved themselves to be a foe not quite so despicable\\nas we had supposed them to have been. In more than\\none engagement they have shown considerable pluck ;\\nand the recapture of Ningpo has cost us more than we\\nhad bargained for. The French have lost an excellent\\nAdmiral, and our noble Admiral has had a very\\nnarrow escape in these engagements. The Tai-pings\\nseem to hold Ward in great contempt ; and when\\nalone, they generally show him that, out of Imperialist\\nsoldiers, he can make nothing but Imperialists soldiers.\\nThese fellows are likely enough to hand him over\\nsome fair day. Probably, he would have been in the\\nsafekeeping of his foes long ere this, were it not for\\nthe timely and generous aid of an arm stronger than\\nhis, which has been stretched forth more than once\\nfor his rescue.\\nHaving been sadly beaten whenever they have had\\nthe boldness to dispute the ground with the English\\nand French openly, the Tai-pings have very wisely\\nfor themselves changed their tactics. They will no\\nlonger meet us face to face; they will exchange no\\nmore powder and shot with us if they can help it ;\\nbut they will hover about us, cut off all supplies,\\nseize our boats, kidnap our men, and vanish into air\\nlike so many spectres, the moment the attempt is\\nmade to grasp them. Pursue them into the interior,\\nand they sniff the air, and laugh at your madness ;\\nreturn, and you will find them at your heels. This is\\na sort of fighting which we shall find desperately hard\\nto deal with ; and this is on enemy that bids fair to\\nwear out our patience before the work is half done.\\nWe recovered several cities and towns around Shang-\\nhae. Not being numerically strong enough to hold them\\nourselves, and the Chinese being too craven-hearted\\nto, do so, they have all been abandoned, and subse-\\nquently re-occupied by the Taipings. Would that as\\nmuch wisdom as courage had been displayed in the\\nrecent measures which had been adopted at Shanghae.\\nThe latter is conspicuous enough\\xe2\\x80\\x94the former is sadly\\nwanting. In forsaking these captured cities, by\\nreason of rebel pressure, and thus confessing our in-\\nability to accomplish what we had undertaken, we\\nhave lost prestige and much moral power. The rebels\\nwill regard each case as a signal victory ; and the Im-\\nperialists are beginning to whisper that foreign\\ngenerals and admirals are good for nothing, and their\\nown little better. Then, what an amount of misery\\nand wretchedness do we heap up for the people by\\nsuch measures. Mere compassion for the people who\\nare the victims of both rebel and imperialist cruelty and\\nrapacity, ought to deter us from adopting rash,\\nill-advised, counsels in the present crisis.\\nMoreover, we have converted the Taipings into\\nbitter enemies to all foreigners, without gaining\\nthe slightest personal advantage, or in the slightest\\ndegree ameliorating the condition of others. Before\\nadopting such measures, the following questions ought\\nto have been seriously considered, \"Is it right? If\\nso, is it practicable ? If practicable, would it be\\nprudent ? Is England prepared seriously to entertain\\nthe thought of the annexation of China ? If so, how\\nis the difficulty with France and Russia to be over-\\ncome? What provinces shall we take to ourselves,\\nand what provinces shall be handed over to the other\\nparties in the field ? These are all fair questions.\\nBut there seems to be a very strong anti-rebel mania\\nprevailing just now, and a determination to put it\\ndown, come what there may. For this purpose our own\\nglorious admiral and ward are seen walking abreast to\\nthe battle-field; Chinamen are taught the foreign\\nmode of warfare ; and our steamers are allowed to\\nconvey Imperialist troops from Hankow to Shanghae.\\nWe believe that the upshot will prove, that blind pas-\\nsion has been wielding the sceptre of late, and not\\ncalm judgment. If Shanghae is to be defended, why\\nnot do so from the only place where it can be done\\neffectually. The movements of the rebels can be con-\\ntrolled only from Nanking ; and it is there the\\nAdmiral ought to make his power felt\\xe2\\x80\\x94not by driving\\nthe rebels out, which would be a suicidal course, but\\nby making the chief feel that his tenure of it depends\\nupon his faithfulness to his promises. This would cost\\nus but little, and the thing would be done effectually.\\nIf we wish to see peace restored to the land, then\\nlet us observe the strictest neutrality between the con-\\ntending parties. It will never be restored by\\nattempts to put down these movements for a\\ndefunct government. Any interference on our part in\\nbehalf of the Imperialists, will only protract a struggle\\nwhich must go on till a dynastic change is effected. It\\nis absurd to expect the Chinese to bring this about in\\nany fashion except their own. They will do it in\\ntheir own time and way.\\nAnd why should we render to the Imperialists the\\nslightest aid ? We have nothing to hope from them,\\nbut everything to fear. They are not friendly to us,\\nand for aught we can see now, never will be. They\\nwould drive us into the sea to-morrow if they had the\\npower. Look at their conduct towards foreigners at\\nHankow or Kiukiang. Were it not for foreign\\ninterference, Hankow would have fallen into the\\nhands of the rebels a year ago. The people\\nare now returning in large numbers, the native\\nhongs are springing up with amazing rapidity, and\\nthe place promises to be as flourishing as ever within\\ntwo or three years. All this is to be traced to the\\npresence of foreigners. But, in spite of the good we\\nhave done them, the mandarins seem bent\\nupon annoying, despising, and cheating us\\nto the utmost of their power. They in-\\nduced our representatives to fix upon the most\\nworthless ground in the place for a British settlement,\\nand have kept us waiting for it for more than a\\ntwelvemonth. When fixed upon, the value of a lot\\nin that part of the town would be about three or four\\nhundred taels ; now they want five thousand\\ntaels. Our boats are stopped here and\\nthere and everywhere along the river, by\\npetty mandarins, because we won\\'t pay them squeezes.\\nWe are insulted, and not unfrequently molested by\\nthe braves ; and the mandarins declare that they can\\'t\\nmanage them. When asked if they could manage\\nthem were they themselves the victims of such indig-\\nnities, they reply that the two cases are different.\\nNot long since, a gentleman was sadly bruised by\\nthese braves, and then taken on board their boat,\\nwhere he was made to go through the three prostra-\\ntions and the nine knocks. The boat was seized, in\\nconsequence, by our authorities, and sent down the\\nYangtse in a blaze. A severe argument this! but,\\nunfortunately, it seems to be the only kind of argu-\\nment they are capable of appreciating. Ever since,\\nthe mandarins have been more careful, and the braves\\nmore civil.\\nWe are told, however, that Prince Kung is our\\nfriend. Well, it is the opinion of some, who are not\\nvery bad judges in such matters, that Prince Kung is\\nplaying a double game. One thing is certain, Prince\\nKung is either insincere, or a mere cipher in the\\nEmpire. The Mandarins in these parts act in direct\\nopposition to the letter of his treaty, and his subse-\\nquent instructions. The case of the Roman Catholic\\npriests and converts is a conclusive proof of this.\\nAccording to the treaty, persons teaching or profess-\\ning the Christian religion shall alike be entitled to the\\nprotection of the Chinese authorities ; nor shall any\\nsuch, peaceably pursuing their calling, and not offend-\\ning against the laws, be persecuted or interfered with.\\nPrince Kung in the Peking Gazette has been reiterating\\nthese sentiments calling upon the mandarins to treat\\nthe Roman Catholic converts justly and lovingly, and\\npromising that the clause in which the Roman Catho-\\nlic religion is proscribed shall be omitted in all future\\neditions of the Sacred Edict. All this is very good ;\\nbut in these provinces, any petty mandarin seems to\\nregard the whole as bosh. This must be because they\\nhave a deeper insight into the secret counsels\\nof Prince Kung than our Minister seems to have, or\\nbecause he is powerless in the administration of\\naffairs.\\nNot long since, an examination was held at Nan\\nChang, the provincial capital of Kiangsi. The Eng-\\nlish, French, and Russians were the theme. The ex-\\namination was concluded by a combined assault on\\nthe Roman Catholic establishment. The life of the\\nforeign priest was sought, but he managed to escape,\\nand afterwards to reach Kiu Kiang in safety. This\\nwas done under the immediate notice of the great\\nofficers of government, and, doubtless, with their\\ntacit consent. Placards have been posted up in\\ndifferent parts of the province, denouncing our ag-\\ngressive policy, exposing our excessive barbarism,\\nand explaining our recent proceedings against the\\nrebels as an atonement to the government for our past\\noffences.\\nIn the province of Kwei Chow, a foreign priest, has\\njust been executed by orders of the local mandarin.\\nHe produced his passport ; but was told that it was a\\nforeign affair, with which his Excellency had nothing\\nto do.\\nIn Hunan, a regular system of persecution has been\\ngoing on for some time. Chapels have been pulled\\ndown, houses of the converts have been broken into,\\nand their property confiscated. The mandarins are\\neither unable or unwilling to do anything in the\\nmatter.\\nIn Peking, the Protestant religion is prohibited. A\\nmedical missionary of large experience and high\\nstanding is there, but he is not allowed to appear in\\nhis compound character. He may heal the sick, but\\nhe must not save souls. A chaplain is there, who\\npossesses an extensive acquaintance with the Manda-\\nrin dialect. Whilst requested to preach every Sun-\\nday to the handful of his fellow-countrymen who re-\\nside in the capital, he dare not mention these things to\\nthe myriads of heathen who perish for the lack of know-\\nledge. It is reported that he is allowed to teach a\\ndozen or more Tartar youths the English language, on\\nthe condition that they hear nothing from him of\\nChrist and him crucified. One of our best missionaries,\\nwho by his learning and piety, would do more to raise\\nthe English character in the estimation of the magnets\\nof Peking than any dozen of common men, has found\\nit impossible to enter that city as a missionary.\\nDuring his fortnight\\'s visit, he might talk to the\\npeople about everything and everybody, except Christ\\nand his religion.\\nWhose fault is this? Are these Prince Kung\\'s\\ndoings ? We doubt it, and that for the good reason\\nthat Roman Catholic priests are there, carrying on\\ntheir work boldly and openly, without any one dar-\\ning to make them afraid. It is difficult to see why\\nthe Chinese government should regard the Roman\\nCatholic priests with greater favour than the Protes-\\ntant missionary. There is not the slightest danger of\\ndisturbance being excited by the preaching of the\\nGospel in the city. Missionaries have visited\\nthe surrounding towns and cities, and have\\nfound the people remarkably well disposed;\\nIt is not probable that they are different within the\\nwalls of the capital. The odium of this must fall, we\\nfear, on one nearer to us than Prince Kung. Such a\\npolicy is unjust and ill-advised. It must be given up\\nsooner or later. Why not at once ? It is high time\\nthis matter should be minutely sifted, and its injustice\\nthoroughly exposed.\\nSuch is the present aspect of affairs. It is rather\\ngloomy and discouraging. Let us hope that better\\ntimes are coming, and that all these commotions, and\\napparently adverse circumstances, will be succeeded\\nby a brighter day than has ever yet dawned on this\\nland._\\nA NEW CONFEDERATE IRON-CLAD. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 A corres-\\npondent of the Dublin Evening Mail writes as follows:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 \"She can steam from 16 to 18 knots an hour, is\\nperfectly seaworthy, for all practical purposes in-\\nvulnerable, and will prove to any vessel she may\\nencounter as formidable an antagonist as our own\\nWarrior, the boast of the British navy. This is the\\n\\'No. 290,\\' as to whose whereabouts Federal cruisers\\nhave with reason betrayed such anxiety. It had been\\nknown for some time that a large and powerful iron\\nvessel was being constructed at the dockyard of\\nMessrs. Laird, Birkenhead ; but monsters of the deep\\nare so much the order of the day at that establish-\\nment that no one troubled his head much about this\\nnew production, or cared to remark the extra thick-\\nness of the plates which were being used. At the\\nvery last moment the Federal authorities seem to have\\nhad their suspicion aroused, for the Tuscarora was\\ndispatched to keep watch in the neighbourhood of\\nthe dock where she lay, and the southern\\ncoast of Ireland was also strictly guarded\\n\\'No. 290,\\' meanwhile, apprised of all that was going\\non, dropped down the river quietly one day, and\\nsteamed out into the bay, nominally for her trial trip,\\nwith a party of ladies and musicians on board. In-\\nstead, however, of returning to her moorings at Bir-\\nkenhead, where she would have been kept in durance\\nvile by the Tuscarora, she quietly landed her pas-\\nsengers at Holyhead, and proceeded on her voyage,\\navoiding the harbours of Cork, Waterford, &c , in the\\nneighbourhood of which she might have heard of\\nsomething not all to her advantage. \\'No. 290\\'\\nsteamed round by Londonderry and Donegal, and was\\njoined off the west coast of Ireland by the steamer,\\nwhich had previously started, having on board the\\narmament intended for the gigantic Ironsides. Had\\nshe even met the Tuscarora while still unarmed it\\nwas the intention of her captain to try the fortune of\\nwar by running stem on at full speed into her anta-\\ngonist. It needs no extraordinary powers of discern-\\nment to discover what excitement must be caused at\\nthe other side of the Atlantic by the arrival of the\\n\\'No. 290.\\' \"'\n",

      " 'j TJNrvEit8iry tsxdowments. j\\nUnivsbsity endowments are the thorne of much\\ncontroversy in the present day. How to with-\\ndraw or distribute them has attraoted more\\nattention than how to increase them. And this\\nhas necessarily been the case. The worthiest\\nuniversity corporations in the world are Oxford\\nand Cambridge, and it ia towards* thom that the\\nreforming spirit has been chiefly directed. Just\\ncause of complaint has been afforded by the\\nmanner in which their endowments and benefac-\\ntions have hitherto been dealt with. Those uni-\\nversities have assuredly done less, and tb.it in linly\\nin the wrong direction, tliau they ought to have\\ndone. They have obstinately lagged bohuid the\\nage ; for in them \\'\" the dust of antique Time lies\\nstill unswept.\" Every eil\\'urt to liberalise) them lins\\nbeen powerfully resisted, and suido>ii has succjdS\\ncrowntd that effort. The To its\\'question w.wa\\nI vexed and protracted one, before any semblance\\nof reason entered the solemn port tis of these\\nancient cloisters. But at last even thoir learned\\nrepose was disturbed. Force from without\\nsucceeded in opening wider the gates ot\\ntheir places which had so long been\\nmerely close boroughs. Although sown\\'nwderu\\ncharacteristics of English hie Were re-\\nflected in Oxford and Oainbridgi, they wero\\nphysical rather than mental charaot<\\xc2\\xa1rtsttcs.\\nTrue, the revoit .of progressive intellect w\\xc2\\xabw ant\\nunheeded, but it was too weak to obum a victory.\\nNot a few of Oxford\\'s best scholars loarlussly\\nassailed her exclasiveuess, and in the hot beds of\\nToryism avowed and pr\\xc2\\xab>pagated the extretnest\\nRadical views. Her recent poet is as Republbun\\nas her young political philosophers aro (J imttst.\\nYet all thewbile she has assuund au attitude! uf\\nserene indifference. Her affluent endowments\\nhave too often been diverted to the maintenance\\nof intelligent laziness, till even now Professor\\nHuxley illustr\\xc3\\xa2tes the condition of the enriched\\nsloth she has encouraged. \" \\xc3\\xafou know\" (he says\\nto tho Aberdeen student*) \"that among the beos\\nit depends on the kind of*cell iu which the egg\\nis deposited, and the quantity and quality ol\\nfood which is supplied to the grub, whether it\\nshall turn out a busy little worker or a big idle\\nqueen. And in the human hive, the cells of the\\nendowed larvas are always tending to enlarge,\\nand their food to improve, until wo got queen*,\\nbeautiful to behold, but which gather no honey\\nand build no comb.\" This similitude cannot be\\nunproved upoD.\\nBut it is not with other Universities as with\\nthese old temples of learning. They have too\\noften Buffered lor lack of the gold required for\\nbare support. \\xc2\\xabSome, indeed, have had uo occa-\\nsion to grumble, yet even they cannot boast of\\ntheir excessive riches. The \\xc2\\xa1Scottish Universities,\\nfor instance, thrive well, and doubtless would do\\nso even were they less favourably endowed than\\nthey are, for they possess many Regius professor-\\nships, besides other chairs established by private\\nmunificence. Trinity College, Dublin, is in a\\nposition moro akin to the great Euglish Univer-\\nsities than any other notable seminary of learning\\nwe can mention ; and this is one reason why she\\nhas been so often and bitterly called to account.\\nBut there is another reason for the attack upon\\nher : she has been jealously regarded by the\\nRoman Catholics as a citadel of Protestantism,\\nand not even that excellent compromise, the\\nQueen\\'s University, could remove this jealousy,\\nit was denounced at the outset \\xc2\\xab13 a trinity of\\n\" godless colleges \" by Sir R. Inglis, when, we\\nthink, he was member for Oxford ; and the Roman\\nCatholics were too glad of such a cry not to take\\nit from the lips of an inveterate Episcopalian.\\nThe large annual grant to Maynooth was no balm\\nto their wounded feelings, and the consequence\\nhas been that not only has Trinity College, Dublin,\\nbeen persistently assailed, but the Queen\\'s\\nUniversity has been unwarrantably maligned and\\ndenounced. Nevertheless, no greater freedom\\nfrom \\xc2\\xab testa . or anything obnoxious to the\\nfeelings and convictions of students of all\\nreligious persuasions can be found than in the\\nQueen\\'s University, Ireland. And this brings us\\nto the point whereat the \\'question of endowments\\nbifurcates as applied to Ireland and to England,\\nand furnishes an unmistakable guide to the\\ntendencies of the two countries. In England it\\nis sought to divert a portion of the endowments\\nof Oxtord and Cambridge to more general uses\\nto widen their approaches, and to assist more of\\nthose who enter them.L In Ireland, the aim is\\ndirectly opposite. There it is desired to \\xc2\\xabdivert\\nthe money in order to erect a more exclusive\\ncollege. The grant of a Charter to a Catholic\\nUniversity must be followed, as we know\\nfrom experience, by a substantial dole, or,\\nmore preferably, by a thick slice from the\\nTrinity cake. The debate in the House of\\nCommons, fourteen months ago, in which Pro-\\nfessor Fawcett so ably distinguished himself as\\na great authority on University questions, ex-\\nposed the tactics of the Catholic hierarchy, and\\ngave-mainly through that exposure-a tresh\\nlease of life to Dublin University. In Scotland,\\nlortuuately, University education has .always\\nbeen on a liberal basis, and nothing has occurred\\nto provoke differences or lend couutenance to an\\nassault on tho endowments. The Established\\nChurch still maintains, certainly, her hold on the\\nTheological Faculty iu each University, but the\\nexclusive right of that Church to the Principal\\nships or Prolessorships (not theological) has boon\\nlong done away with. We had notable instances\\nof this in the appointments of Sir David\\nBrewster and of his successor, Sir Alexander\\nGrant, as Principals of tho University of Edin-\\nburgh ; of a Free Church man, Professor Veitch,\\n1 to the Chair of Logic, and of Mr. Edward Caird,\\n1 to that of Moral Philosophy in Glasgow Uni-\\nversity ; and of Dr. Calderwood, a United Pres-\\nbyterian clergyman, to the Professorship of Moral\\nPhilosophy m Edinburgh. This removal of\\nsectarian supremacy h\\xc2\\xabu> already dono inestimable\\ngood. Tho Loudon University, on the other\\nhand, was tho result of revolted and magnificent\\neffort, and the distinction for liberality and use-\\nfulness which she sought has already been\\nachieved. But her case in nowise touches the\\nquestion in the light 111 which wo have viewed it.\\nHowever, we care les3 for disputes about the\\nalienation oi endowments aud -the reasons\\nannexed thereto, than we do about an increase\\nof them where they ara especially wanted. Wa\\nhave iu our midst a tree of knowledge planted\\nir. good soil, but it requires watering and tendiug.\\nIn other words Sydney University, although it\\ndoes not languish, is not the object of that sub-\\nstantial care which ought to be bestowed on it.\\nThis University is not open to any of the objec-\\ntions applicable to some ot those already passed\\nin review. Neither obeso endowments nor can-\\nkering tests afl\\'\\xc2\\xab,ct her body. She is the embodi-\\nment of the time, saving the wealth which is\\nlooked upon as the sinews.\\' Such an institution,\\nindeed, cannot fail to exercise a wiso and\\nbeneficial inlluence on a young \\' community ;\\nand the more attractive it is made the\\nless \\' excuse will remain, for those who sail\\nto Europo for a University education. Still\\nit is not to this more afilucnt cl.iss that our ob-\\nservations will have reference ; it is rather to the\\nclass who cannot afford, and yet lonjr-for, the\\nhighest instruction, and who if enabled to prose-\\ncute their studies would probably reflect honour\\non the country. The mere racej for wealth is\\nanything but ennobling, and nothing acts so\\nsoothingly on the nation hastening to become\\nrich, than pervading intelligence and high and\\nrefined culture. It we look at those countries\\nwhich in their infancy neglected to take learning\\nby the hand, we perceive a ruggedness and want\\not pure taste disagreeably remarkable. The com-\\nmercial enterprise and the advancement of agri-\\ncultural, pastoral, and mining pursuits are not\\nretarded, but aided by the spread of higher learn-\\ning. The Scotch, who are commonly accounted\\na shrewd people, saw this centuries ago, and sup^\\nported with comparative profusonesa and energy\\ntheir insufficiently endowed colleges; and wa\\nhave only to look at their schools, regarded as\\nmodels throughout the world, to witness the\\nfiuits of -voluntary effort in raising money to\\nbuild and endow them. The bursaries, not leas\\nthan the scholarships and prizes, are rich in\\nnumber and amount ; and as an instance of the\\nbenefit accruing from one wo may cite the Snell\\nExhibition of Glasgow University. That reward\\nfor tcholarahip is given annually in the shape of\\n\\xc2\\xa3130 ajear for fa ve years to two students who\\nprticeed to Oxford for that period. Of those thus\\naidi d, and most of whom could never have pro-\\nceeded thitber without assistance, the names of\\nDr. Adam Smith (author of the \"Wealth of\\nNations\"), Sir William Hamilton, the present Arch-\\nbishop of Canterbury, and the present Lord Presi-\\ndent oi \\xc2\\xa1Scotland, occur to us among a host of dis\\ntingiiii-htd nien. Other scholarships, fellowships,\\n\\xc2\\xa1um bursaries-many near and up to .\\xc2\\xa3100 per\\nai.nuni are conferred on students remaining at\\ntheir Universities ; while another class of bursa-\\nries, and th.it a very largo one, are given to de\\nst rvmg j oung men before they go to Uollege at all,\\nin order to enable them to go there. Their parents\\nare generally tuo poor to send them, and at their\\nage they are unable to earn enough to_ support\\nthemselvt-s while there. Heuce the wise previ-\\nsion and provision made. Many brilliant in-\\nstances of that kind of timely and substantial\\natsistance are to bo found in the colonies, doing\\ntheir educated best for their adopted land.\\nTho above is but a casual illustration of the\\nway in which countries when comparatively\\npoorer than New South Wales dealt with the\\ngrowing want of education of the highest class,\\nand looked to learning as something supremely\\ndeserving of support. Much nonsense has, indeed,\\nbeen talked about paying for otheia out of money\\nmade for oneself, and by oneself. Verily, this is\\nthe meanest kind of selfishness. Moreover, it has\\nbeen said that \" compulsory education is justified\\nby the consideration that ignorant people do not\\nwant to be taught,\" but when it is argued from\\nthis that others partly educated do not desire a\\nUniversity education it is trifling absurdly with\\nthe question. Those who have slaked but not\\nquenched their thirst for learning may be the\\nvery ones too \\xc3\\xa7oor to pay for another draught ,of\\nthe Pierian spring. Again, the pursuit of Jcnow\\nledge under difficulties ia a pet stone to throw \\'at\\nthe advocates for assisting students, but would\\nthat knowledge not have been greater and better\\nas well\\' as sooner gained, had there been fewerjor\\nno difficulties 1 All this is sheer begging the\\nquestion. The conclusion such people draw\\nis drawn from the premises of their\\npocket. Others may freely think and believe that\\nthere is nothing to object to but r<ither something\\npiaiseworihy in this giving to the cause of educa\\ntiau-if others do so. But-agerc considerate\\nplnris est quam, cogitare jtrudenter. Amerita,\\ntoo, furnibhi\\'S eminent examples of merchants\\nand others giving quickly ana largely, and it i.s\\nneedles-s to specily where the instaucea are almost\\ninnumerable.\\nA writer in Frasers Magazine declares that\\n\"if there were not considerable funds devoted\\' te\\nthe support of the studies which do not itnniodi\\n;itely lend themselves to utilitarian purpose*, the\\nstudies would be altogether neglectsd.\" This is\\nindisputably true. Our advance in every branch\\nof science, ;irt, aud industry is bat thought in\\naction. Leisuie is required to mature any great\\nproject, to perfect any great inveution. If to the\\ninventive genius of mechanics and non-univer-\\nsity men wo owe many of the best invention1\\nand most important discoveries, we owe theil\\ncompletion to methodically and highly-trained\\nUniversity men. We all know thit Watt dis\\ncovered steam\\xc2\\xbb and that Stephenson invented the\\ncteam-engine, but we must not forget that Profes-\\nsor Wheatstone and Professor William Thomson\\ngave us our telegraph system. _ Besides,\\nscientific inquiry and -the artistic appli-\\ncation of results can only be made i by\\nthose who have boen specially educated to a\\nknowledge of the phenomena. We say nothing\\nhere of literature, philosophy, and the fine arts,\\nwhich elevate, strengthen, and refine a people, for\\nit would be quite superfluous to offer any re-\\nmarks thereon to those who appreciate the value\\nof cultivated taste, and the proper guidance of\\nintellectual power.\\nThe influence of Sydney University requires,\\nin our opinion, to be extended, and that is mainly\\nto be done by amplifying the means at her com-\\nmand. Her endowments ought to be increased.\\nShe would then be able to take a wider range and\\nto embrace every section of the community ; for\\na University should combine all classes as well\\nas all studies of paramount utility and of value\\nin themselves, and from it as a centre should\\nradiate the ideas that would germinate through\\nthe country. Additional scholarships might be\\nfounded, and inducements held ont to\\ndeserving men to prolong their studies or\\ncontinue their scientific investigations in\\nthe University. But this is, alter all, a\\nconsideration\" secondary and auxiliary to the\\nbringing of the makings of such men to the\\nUniversity. A number of bursaries sufficient\\nin money to sustain in the most moderate way\\nthe picked scholars of our leading academies in\\ntown and country, supplemented by other bur-\\nsaries given by private individuals to youthful\\naspirants, would go very far indeed to aid the\\ncause which we have so much at heart. The\\ncondition of granting the latter sort of help would\\nnecessarily be the inability of the student to main-\\ntain himself, and thus a low rung in the social\\nladder -would be reached. There is, moreover,\\nanother reason. Very few poor students can\\nafford the expense incurred iu the training preli-\\nminary to a competitive examination-and as it\\nis, we are no lovers of cram. The system is a\\nvicious one, for the most part vain even while it\\ncramps the youthful faculties, further, the\\nbeveral colleges incorporated with Sydney Uni-\\nversity might easily obtain money enough to\\nattract one or two scholars each to them, and thus\\nprovide them with college bursaries to the Uiii\\nversity. The Queenslander are beginning to\\nt-ee the need and pressure of this Bubject, and\\nere long we may see among us a contingent of\\ntheir foremost Grammar scholars at the University.\\nThey propose to devote \\xc2\\xa32000 per annum to the\\nsending and keeping of these youths-that is,\\nnearly half the annual endowment originally\\ngranted to Sydney University for buildings,\\nstipends, scholarships, prizes, ifec. Let us take\\nthe hint.\\nWe aro not going to say anything here against\\nParliament on the score of endowments, for we\\ngladly admit that they have been most liberal\\nwhen they believed it to be tbeir duty. What\\nthey have already done is in the highest, degree\\npraisewoi thy, and he would bo a churl who\\ni thought otherwise. But as the population\\nincreases, and scientific progress marches at\\n.double quick time, the, necessity for more\\nendowed chairs and additional encouragement to\\nI scholars advances with them.\\nIt is, however, to our chief merchants, miners, I\\nand landowners that the real urgency of the case |\\nmust be put. They have done much already, for\\nthere aro among our citizens men whose generous\\ntreatment of this difficulty will secure to tht m\\nthe lasting gratitude of the colony. Where so\\nmany have liberally given of their substance I\\'or\\nthe promotion of learning, it would be invidious to\\nparticularize. Others equally able to afford the\\nmeans may well follow the beneficent example\\nbefore them, The poorer students must,be thcl:\\nespecial care, although the rewards for industry\\nand distinction may wisely be multiplied. It\\nmust, nevertheless, ,be remembered that though\\nprizes may stimulate they cannot feed and clothe\\nthe poorer though perhaps better scholar ; and\\neither the scholarships for the best competitors at\\nthe matriculation examinations must be largely\\nincreased, or bursaries such as we have suggested\\nmust be given. Professors and teachers will re-\\nceive more money the greater the number of\\'their\\npupils, and bo far as they are concerned the ques-\\ntion necti not be considered further at present.\\nThere Is little fear of our professors or students\\nfattening on\\'endowments, or becoming mero lotus\\neatiug fellows of one college or another ; little\\ndanger, indeed, of Professor Huxley\\'s reproach\\ntouching us. Over-wealthy endowments can\\nnever exist among us with our experience, but\\nlet them, for all that, be sufficient in number and\\namount. The Sydney University has unques-\\ntionably a\\'claim on all classes of the community,\\nand we trust that claim will be readily\\xc2\\xab speedily,\\nand substantially recognised.\\nBETA.'\n",

      " 'SOCIAL AFFAIRS IN ENGLAND.\\nLONDON, NOVKMBBB 6, 1868.\\n[WHITTEN EVPRESBI/V ion THE S. M. HEKALII.]\\nTHE great political battle for Parliamentary power\\nhas now fairly commenced, and before a fortnight\\nhas elapsed the country will have emphatically deci-\\nded whether the Conservatives or the Liberals are\\nto be masters of the situation. Everywhere the\\ncanvassing is going on in grim earnest, sometimes,\\nae at Blackburn, mingled with fierce rioting and\\neven bloodshed. The publicans, too, ate playing\\ntheir little game. Where they are not being bribed\\nby the different competing candidates, they are to be\\nfound starting their own man, their logic evidently\\nbeing that if the electors choose to make them an in-\\nfluential class, it is but fair that the influence so ob-\\ntained should be exerted to the uttermost on behalf\\nof those possessing it. The new voters do not, as a\\nrule, see things exactly in this light, hence we have\\nthe curious end significant anomaly of the great mass\\nof electors being found ranged on one side, and the\\nunpopular candidates, backed\\'by the publicans, on the\\nother. Of course, every possible political and social\\ntopic has now a chance of being discussed. For in-\\nstance, the Sunday question \\xc3\\x8dB continually being\\nmooted at the different election meetings, but in a very\\nfew places only are the candidates found sufficiently\\nbold to declare themselves in favour of the opening of\\nmuseums and similar places of recreation on Sundays,\\nso greatly is public opinion divided on the subject.\\nVery significant is the unmistakable rebuffs which\\nthe working-class candidates are everywhere expe-\\nriencing. Although want of money may have had\\nsomething to do with their general non-success, the\\nreal obstacle with which they have had to contend is\\nthe popular instinct respecting their utter uafitness\\nfor Parliamentary duties. Take, for instance, the\\nsecularist Bradlaugh, who is now struggling to procure\\none of the Beats ocrupied by Charles Gilpin and Lord\\nHenley at Northampton. Suppose for a moment that he\\nwas returned for that busy_ tow n, what possible informa-\\ntion could he impart to his fellow-members respecting\\nthe social condition and wants of the working class ?\\nAbsolutely nothing. He is a mere clap-trap speaker.\\nMere demagogues are out of place in Parliament.\\nWhat is really wasted are men whose character and\\nabilities shall be of the right kind. That the people\\ncan recognise these, even in a political opponent, is\\nclearly shown by the cordial reception recently\\nawarded the Marquis of Salisbury at Manchester.\\nTen years ago the idea of a Conservative statesman\\nbeing feted by the \" Manchester School \" would have\\nappeared impossible of realisation. Sut this is the\\nage of anomalies, and therefore we are surprised\\nat nothing. Yet the event is not with-\\nout its importance. It seems to be, to\\nquote the words of an experienced journalist :\\n\" One of those incidents which to the future historian\\nof this country will seem to mark a peaceful revolu-\\ntion in its political and social relations. It looks as if\\nthe barrier\\'of strangeness and distrust between the\\nhereditary territorial aristocracy and the democratic\\npotentates of an industrial epoch, were breaking\\ndown, end that the great principles which have BO\\nlong been the watchwords of an advanced pirty, were\\nbecoming the common property ot public men of all\\nparties, orders, and degrees, with any pretensions to\\nstatesmanship.\" That Mr. Gladstone will have re\\nsawed the premiership, with a large majority to sup-\\nport him, by Christmas, seems to be generally\\naccepted even by the Tories aa an inevitable fact.\\nAustralian interests bid fair to be pretty well repre-\\nsented in the new Parliament. Colonel Torren\\xc2\\xbb seems\\nto have a good chance at Cambridge, Mr. M\\xc2\\xabArthur\\nis safe for Lambeth, and of the other half-dozen can-\\ndidates connected in some way or another with Aus-\\ntralian matters, not one has even the prospect of\\nfailure.\\nlhe\" death of the Archbishop of Canterbury has\\nexcited considerably less remark than would have\\nbeen the case had the event occurred at a time when\\nthe public mind was not so fully occupied with\\npolitical matters. The Archbishop was a good and\\nkind-hearted man, but scarcely fitted for the im-\\nportant post which he was called upon to hold. The\\nnonconformist, a journal not much given to speaking\\nwell of the epifcepacy, commenting on the prelate\\'s\\ndecease, remarks that the Archbishop \\xc2\\xab\\' died-after <\\nconducting the Church, of which he waa the nominal ,\\nhead, with at least great judiciousness, through a I\\nserien of almost unparalleled troubles-a good and\\nbumble man. Those who Baw him frequently-and\\nthis, at one time, \\'was the case with ourselves-and\\nthose \"who knew him intimately, will both say that he\\nwas a Christian gentleman. Be had gTeat suayity of\\nmanser, but he never produced the impression of\\nbeing insincere. \"When one comes to think of it this\\nis a good deal to say for an Archbishop of Canter\\nbury, for it is a good deal to say of any man, and\\nmore especially of any clergyman, who has risen to\\nthe highest office in the land. Few could wear the\\nloftiest mitre without showing some spiritual or, at\\nany rate, some human pride. The late Archbishop\\nindicated no vice of this kind.\" Never was man\\nplaced in a greater dilemma than is Mr. Disraeli at\\nihe present moment. Whatever way he may decide,\\nhe is certain .to create for himself a host of enemies\\nwithin the Church.\\nAmong the minor and almost unnoticed indications\\nof social progress in this country is the gradual dis-\\nappearance of the once familiar turnpike gatea. The\\nturnpike-road system seems to have been a complete\\nfailure. It was as bad as the French octroi, without\\nany of its advantages. True, the main roads were\\noften maintained in pretty good order, but the side\\nthoroughfares were invariably neglected ; and, how-\\never pleasant might be our green country lanes on a\\nbright sunny day, a shower of rain sufficed to\\nspeedily render them almoBt impassable. Travellers\\nusing vehicles or horses were heavily taxed, at the\\nsame lime the revenue thus raised was totally insuffi-\\ncient for the purpose for which it was required, the\\nconsequence being an enormous amount of debt, the\\ninterest m which at the present time consumes a\\nconsiderable percentage of the sums annually raised\\nby the taxation of those making use of the roads on\\nwhich the toll-gates still exist. The management of\\nthe vrious turnpike trusts appears to have fallen into\\nthe hands of the legal profession, to whom they have\\nproved almost as rich a source ot wealth as has the\\nChancery Cturt itself. To rescue the different trusts\\nfrom the grasp of the lawyers, and afterwards to re-\\nplace the system of turnpike tolls by one based on the\\nplan of a county rate, has been the object of those\\nendeavouring to sting about a better state of things.\\nIn this they are proving very successful, the chief\\ndifficulty being the vast amount of debt with which\\nthe various trusts are encumbered. Indeed, so great\\nis the progress made, that it is probable the day is not\\nvery far distant when the millennium of the children of\\nRebecca shall have arrived, and not a toll-gate be\\nknown in the kingdom. The effects of the abolition\\nof the turnpike system on local traffic will be im\\nmenee, rspecially in agricultural districts where it has\\nlong impeded the development of agricultural enter-\\nprise and improvements.\\nThe reappearance of distress in the eastern metro-\\npolitan districts has again directed public attention to\\nthe subject of emigration. The recent American mail\\ninforms us that \"An \\'Immigration Convention,\\' in-\\ntended to unite in one body all the societies through-\\nout America, formed for the encouragement of immi-\\ngration and the protection of immigrants, has just\\nbeen held at Baltimore.\" If our Transatlantic brethren\\nreally desire to avail themselves of our surplus labour\\nthev will have no difficulty in procuring it, but the\\nmajority of English statesmen would, we suspect,\\nrather behold the stream of labour drifting\\ntowards Australia. The Welch, it may be remem-\\nbered, have attempted to form a colony in Patagonia.\\nThere seems, after all, a chance of the experiment\\nturning out satisfactorily, notwithstanding the diffi-\\nculties with which its promoters have had to contend.\\nThe original idea was to make the settlement purely\\nWelch in character. This portion of the scheme has\\nnow been abandoned, and the influx ot British\\ncolonists is cordially invited. Ina very short time it\\nis intended to send out a Church clergyman to the\\ncolony, indeed, an application to that effect has I\\nalready been made by the colonists to the Bishop of\\nBangor, a circumstance which has encouraged the\\nformation of a band of Church people as emigrants for\\nthe new colony. The movement is an extremely im-\\nportant one. If ever a penal settlement is planted in\\nthe Falklands - and the supposition is not an\\nunlikely one-a system of graduated punish-\\nments will probably be attempted by fixing\\nanother settlement on the Fatagoniun coast,\\nto which the better class of convicts might\\nbe removed. It certainly would be most\\nunwise to leave it in the power of Russia or America\\nto get hold of this important part of the world. Al-\\nready a French adventurer claims to be \"King of\\nPatagonia,\\'* by election of the native tribes. There\\nmay be more than a madman\\'s trick in this ; it may\\nbe that something of the hocus-pocus principle,\\ncharacteristic of the recent Fijian treaty, may have\\nbeen practised in this particular case. A settlement\\nhalf-way between Australia and England would be\\ninvaluable to us, both nationally and commercially.\\nProvidence has evidently handed over the southern\\nzone to British colonisation, and the presence of an\\nAnglo-Saxon element in South America may do\\nmuch towards remedying the misrule and neglect\\nby which an effete Spanish race have so-\\nlong closed that large and beautiful country\\nagainst the advancing wave of emigration. That\\nthe emigration movement may ultimately become\\ndiverted to the South may be inferred from a very\\nremarkable paper, by Mr. C. H. Pearson, on \" The\\nLand Question in the \"United States,\" in which it is\\ncontended that the wholesale manner in which Ame-\\nrican capital is being invested in American land will,\\nwithin the next twenty years, cause the stoppage of\\nthe facilities and inducements at present held by\\n\"United States emigrants. He also tells us that \" the\\nfuture of our colonies is in their own hands, that the\\nland reserve of which they dispose is one that may\\neasily be exhausted, and that in \"Victoria a cry against\\nany encouragement to fresh emigrants is already a\\nwatchword with the popular party.\" Comfortable\\nthinking this, eh? But what are we to do if the\\nrest of the world is to be closed against our surplus\\npopulation? \" Teach the people,\" says Mr. Pear-\\nson, and remember \" if the work be not done within\\nthe next twenty years, it is just possible that our\\nchildren may have to maintain order, and whatever\\nmakes up society, by the sword.\" Perhaps it will\\nnot be quite so bad as that. At least, we hope not.\\nIt is, however, not very encouraging to those\\ndesirous of founding new enterprises in the Southern\\nhemisphere, to read the accounts of the recent pro-\\nceedings in connection with the attempted winding\\nup of the Panama, New Zealand, and Australian\\nBoyal Mail Company. The Times calls attention to ?\\nthe circumstance \" that the course of post between\\nthis country and New Zealand and Australia, via\\nPanama, has now been reduced to less than four\\nmonths,replies to the letters which left Southampton\\non the 2nd of July having been received on the 27th\\ninstant, a period of only 117 days. Of this,\\' 22 days\\nand nine days respectively were afforded in New Zea-\\nland and Sydney for answering letters, the time occu-\\npied on the through voyage each way between\\nWellington and Southampton being 47\\xc2\\xbf days, and\\nbetween Sydney and Southampton 54 days.\"\\nThe publication of this statement has tended to\\nrevive public confidence in the possible future\\nprosperity of the enterprise, should the desire of the\\ngieat body of creditors be complied with. This desire\\nis that \"the company should be continued, there\\nbeing every reason to believe that the undertaking\\ncan be worked with profitable results.\" There exists\\nalso a general impression amongst all interested in\\nsuch matters that if the various suggestions made by\\nMr. Cave, M.P., at the recent extraordinary general\\nmeeting of the Company, were carried out, they would\\nresult in complete success. It is a significant circum-\\nstance that at the recent half-yearly meeting of the\\nRoyal Mail Steam Packet Company, an opinion was\\nexpressed by the shareholders that proceedines\\nadverse to the Panama, New Zealand, and Australian\\nRoyal Mail Company should be avoided, and that, as\\nthe service across the Pacific contributes to the re-\\nceipts of the Boyal Mail Company, increased facilities\\nshould be afforded for developing the traffic with the\\nAustralasian colonies. In the report of the same\\nCompany, just issued, allusion is made to the finan-\\ncial difficulties of the Panama Company, and a hope\\nis expressed that this service will be continued, as it\\nhas been -worked with great regularity, and has of\\ncourse brought traffic to the Royal Mail Company.\\nIhe fatewell dinner to Sir James Fergusson, the\\nnew Governor of South Australia, at Willis\\'s Rooms,\\nwas a great success, If Sir James only creates as\\nfavourable an impression at the Antipodes as he did\\nat the banquet, the South Australians will\\nhave no cause to regret his arrival. He\\nspoke with much good sense, and seemed perfectly\\nwwe of the responsibilities attached to his new\\noffice. Although his Conservative views have acted\\nas a hindrance to his gaining popularity here, people\\nhave not forgotten his presence in the Crimea, and\\nhow he wa\\xc2\\xbb wounded at the battle of Inkermann.\\nMr. Disraeli certainly might have made a worse\\nappointment.! The dinner itself was a brilliant affair,\\nas such celebrations generally are, especially when\\nheld at Willis\\'sJRooms. Among the features of the\\nevening was the .? loving cup \" filled with real South\\nAustralian wine, scarcely distinguishable from the best\\nclaret. Whether Australian beef or mutton graced\\nthe tables neither gntsts nor waiters seemed to know.\\nBut then your real cook is such a genius. We do\\nnot always know what we eat.\\nA collision at the mouth of the Thames, whereby\\nthe Leichhardt, a ship boundj from London to New\\ni \\xc2\\xbf\\xc2\\xabaland, was run down and sunk by the steamer\\nNorth Star, has revived the public interest in the\\nsubject of the increasing number of disaster, at sea.\\nThe Board of Trade has ordered an inquiry into the\\nmatter, it being asserted that the pilot in charge of the\\nsteamer was drunk. To call the affair a collision\\nset ms a misuse of the word. As a morning journal\\nvery truly remarks, \" the case for the assessors of the\\nBoord of Trade in the matter of the Leichardt and the\\nNorth Star is as simple as a ease of assault in a police\\ncourt, when a drunken passer-by has knocked down a\\nsober and inoffensive person standing still on the\\npublic pavement.\" Has it ever entered the heads of\\ninsurance companies and shipowners that a consider\\nable proportion of the losses incurredby them may\\nhave arisen fi om the intemperate habits of those in\\ncharge of their vessels ? It is to be feared that drun-\\nkenness is as terrible in its destructive effects on\\nsea as well as on land. The captain, no leas than\\nthe common seaman, is not above the temptation,\\noffered by the brandy bottle, and in too many caaes\\na cargo of gunpowder, would be far less dangerous\\nthan is the presence of a barrel of rum in the ship\\'s\\nhold. It is a significant fact, that the proportion of\\nvoyages safely made by temperance captains-and\\nthere are many such-is double, and even treble, that\\nmade by their drinking brethren. If the rum bottle\\nwere banished from aboard ships, the number of\\nshipping disasters would speedily become dimin-\\nished.\\nBut the drink-demon is persecuting us even more\\nheavily on land, for to its influence ia directly traceable\\nmuch of the pauperism with which we are cursed,\\nand which is daily increasing to such an\\nextent as to appal all who have become\\nacquainted with the same. New workhouses, in-\\nfirmaries, asylums for the imbecile poor, and other\\ninstitutions, are being erected in all directions, but\\nthe more we provide accommodation the more it\\nbecomes required. Pauperism is increasing faster\\nthan the means of relief, and how it will end no one\\ndares predict. The new Parliament will be called\\nupon to solve many questions, but none of auch im-\\nportance as this. Ihe pressure of local taxation ia\\nalso increasing at a fearful tate. In St. Paneras the\\nangry ratepayers are up in arms ; in other parishes\\nthe murmur of discontent is daily growing more and\\nmore loud. In Hackney, the\" poor-rates for the\\ntwelve months ending Lady Day, 1868, wore \\xc2\\xa335,000.\\nFor the six months ending Lady Day, 18G9, they will\\nbe i36,000 ! It is everywhere the same. Tura which\\nway we will-North, East, West, or South-the\\nsame dismal picture presents itself. What are we\\nto do ? The new j ear \"will dawn anything but hope-\\nfully for us. With poverty and disease waiting\\nsadly at our gate, how are we to enjoy Christmas r\\nIn the presence of this terrible social problem, all\\npolitical questions sink into utter insignificance. We\\ncare not whether Ritualists carry on their senseless\\nmummeries to a greater or lesser extent-we care not\\nwhether my Lord Fiddle-de-dee is to wield the rein\\xc2\\xbb\\nof political power, or whether they are to be entrusted\\nto the charge of my Lord Tweedledum ; but we do\\ncare whether or not we are to continue to bear thia\\nfestering canker in our very midst, eating up\\nour prosperity, and dragging us down from.\\nthe temple of our pride. Would that the\\nday had arrived when men, forgetting their religious\\nand political differences, strove to exert themselves to\\nameliorate the condition of our poorer brethren. Hoir\\nmean, contemptible, and ignoble seem all these petty\\nbickerings about points of religious doctrine or arti-\\ncles of political faith, in presence of tho dark cloud\\nwhich is beginning to gather over our social fortunes.\\nIf men would but imbibe a little more of the true\\nspirit which animated Him, whose birthday will\\nbefore these lines are being read beneath the Southern\\nCross-have been celebrated with gladness and joy\\nthroughout the civilised wotld, we might hope for\\nbetter thingB.

      " 'THE LATE GUNPOWDER EXPLOSION.\\nINQUEST ON THE BODY OF GEORGE GAMBLE.\\n[FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.]\\nAn inquest was held before Mr Brown, coroner for the dis-\\ntrict, at the Weatherboard Inn, \"Western Road on the 17th\\ninstant, upon the body of George Gamble, nineteen years\\nof age, who was killed on Thursday evening, while driving\\na dray loaded with blasting powder, which exploded.\\nWilliam McManamey, on oath, deposed: I am a senior\\nconstable of police, stationed at Pulpit Hill, Bathurst dis-\\ntrict , about 8 o\\'clock last evening, I was informed at the\\nstation that there had been an explosion of two tons of\\nblasting powder, that was being conveyed on a dray owned\\nby James Melville, and driven by deceased, the powder\\nwas the property of Mr. W. W. Watkins, railway con-\\ntractor; I proceeded to Spring-hill, five miles from the\\npolice station; I there saw the body of deceased, it was\\nforty feet from where the dray was when the powder\\nblew up, the body was quite naked, the skin\\nbeing scorched off all over, it was lying on its\\nstomach, the hands stretched forward, some of the\\nbowels were twisted round the fence that encloses\\nthe railway cuttings, I found the left foot of deceased was\\nabout four yards from the body and through the fence; it\\nappeared as if it had been torn off by striking against the\\nfence; there were marks on the post of the fence as if the\\nbody had struck against it; on examining the body I ob-\\nserved that the head was nearly torn from the trunk, it\\nwas only held on by a small piece of skin on ths lsft side of\\nthe neck, the right side of the head, face, and neck had\\na black, burnt appearance, tha skin and hair of the head\\nwere torn off for several inches, the right ear was wholly\\ngone, the eyes were black and scorched , the jaws and face\\nwere smashed, the arms broken, the right hip was very\\nblack and torn inwards for a depth of from two to three\\ninches, and for a circle of six inches the flesh was gone. It\\nappeared as if the right side of deceased was nearest the\\nfire, the right leg below tbe knee was broken , the axle of\\nthe dray lay on the side of the road, ten feet from\\nwhere the dray was at the time of the explosion, one tire\\nof wheel is some considerable distance further off, there\\nis no other trace of a dray left, one of the horses was lying\\non his near side about five yards away , the entrails\\nwere strewn over the road, the heart laying some distance\\nfrom the body, another horse appeared as if he bad been\\nforced along the road with great velocity, his back was\\nbroken near the shoulders, and entrails forced out; a\\nthird horse was found about thirty yards away, and had\\nbeen lifted from the road over the railway\\ncutting and fence enclosing it, he was quite blind; a\\nfourth horse had the off hind leg tom away, was scorched, and\\nblind, since dead , a fifth had the hoof torn off the hind leg,\\nblind, since dead, the sixth is very much scorched and\\nnearly blind , the harness is all destroyed; the banks at the\\nside of the road were much torn up , the telegraph wire was\\nblown off half a dozen of the posts, three panels of fencing\\nwere broken, and posts and rails split about 40 feet off.\\nJohn Keegan deposed I have a contract with Mr.\\nWatkins for the cartage of blasting powder from the railway\\nstation, Penrith, to No. 4 section Great Western Railway\\nextension, I1 helped to load deceased\\'s dray on Monday\\nlast, I objected to take the powdor in its then unfit state\\nfor transit, numbers of the casks being loose, and the\\npowder escaping from them, Mr. Francis, and Mr. Watkins,\\nclerk of works, said if I did not take the powder some one\\nelse would, and that my security (\\xc2\\xa3100) would pay for a\\ngood deal of the carriage; I, to save my security,\\nloaded deceased\\'s dray, and two others driven by\\nmy self, I felt the risk my drivers incurred\\nso much that I begged Mr Watkins not to\\nallow the powder to be sent, he did not interfere, as the\\nteams proceeded along the road theo powder was dropping\\nout, when riding up from Pennth this morning there\\nwere traces of the powder all the way along, and on several\\noccasion when my horse trod on it the loose powder ex-\\nploded, sending flame up to the horses girth.\\nMichael Redden deposed; I am a carrier, and was about\\nseven yards ahead of deceased at the time of the explosion,\\nhad been travelling with him for two or three miles, de-\\nceased was, when I first saw him a few minutes before the\\noccurrence, walking at the side of the dray, he was sober;\\nI saw powder along the road, it had dropped from the dray\\nin front of me, driven by Pat Keegan, after the discharge\\nI found one of deceased\\'s shaft horses had been driven\\nunder my dray between the wheels, I had some difficulty\\nm gotting the horse extricated from its position, no part\\nof deceased\\'s dray or loading was visible after the explo-\\nsion, I saw deceased\\'s body after it was found.\\nJohn Redden deposed; I was about fifty yards behind\\ndeceased\\'s dray, when the powder took fire a turn of the\\nroad intercepted my view, mv horses turned round on the\\nroad and knocked me down, when I recovered no dray or\\nloading was to be seen, deceased was sober, and did not\\nsmoke, I saw the body of deceased after it was found,\\npowder was strewn along the road from the drays that pre-\\nceded me; I helped my brother to get the horse from under\\nhis team.\\nPatrick Keegan deposed; I loaded at the same time with\\ndeceased, I heard my father (J. Keegan) refuse to\\ntake the powder in the drays, which he after-\\nwards did at the instigation of Mr. Francis, the\\ncasks were quite unfit to be moved , half on each load were\\nloose, hoops broken, and heads not tight, from the start\\nthe powder was strewing on the road, they said to them-\\nselves often that they would be blown up , my father fol-\\nlowed as far as the top of Lapstone Hill, to caution us to\\nuse every care for this time, and he would throw up the\\ncontract before he would expose us to such risk again;\\nwhen the explosion took place he was about thirty yards\\nahead, I was standing on the shaft of my wag-\\non, I was thrown off , as I was descending I\\nwas struck near theo eye with the telegraph wire, that was\\njust at same instant blown off the posts; I did not perceive\\nthat it was deceased\\'s load that exploded at first, I thought\\nit was my own , I started to run away, but seeing my load\\nuntouched, I proceeded to where deceased\\'s dray had been;\\nI saw deceased\\'s body found, he did not drink any intoxi-\\ncating liquor, or smoke, after we started from the Plains.\\nThe jury found a verdict of \"Accidentally killed, by ex-\\nplosion of gunpowder,\" adding the following rider, viz :-\\n\\'The parties in charge of the powder belonging to Mr.\\nWatkins, at Emu Plains, have not used proper precaution,\\nby not seeing that the casks were in a fit state to convey\\npowder.\"'\n",

      " 'Special Sitting at Nisi Pnivs.\\nBefore Ilib Honor tho Chiet Justice and n jury of\\nfinir.\\nCOOK V. 11Y11NE\\xc3\\x8d, AND ANOTHEK.\\nTho trial of this case, which had already lasted two\\ndays, was resumed and concluded.\\nIt was on action bj- Simon Cook, a farmer of Illawarra,\\nagainst James Bj-mcs and William Byrnes, proprietors of\\ntho Mount Pleasant Colliery, to recover damages for the\\npollution of a creek or small stream of fresh water which\\nran through tho plaintiff\\'s land, by coal from tho defend-\\nants\\' worts. Tho plaintiff\\'B declaration put tho case in\\ntwo ways, first, that the creek had been wilfully polluted\\nby tho casting of coal therein ; secondly, that tho damiegti\\nhad been the result of ncgltgenco. Tho defendants had\\npleaded-first, a general doninl that thej- had dono any\\ninjury to tho plaintiff ; secondly, that whatever injury had\\nbeen inflicted lind been the unavoid.iblo result of what thoy\\nhad done in the lawful conduct of their businoss as coal\\nlumera.\\nSir William Manning, Q.C., Mr. Darloy, and Mr. Salo-\\nmons, instructed by Mr. Maguire, appeared for the plaintiff;\\nand Mr.,Butlor, instructed by Messrs. Allen, Bowden, and\\nAllen, for the defendants.\\nTho plaintiff was the lessee of Spring G rovo, a farm of\\nfifty acres, at Fairy Meadow, Wollongong district,\\nin the vicinity pf the Mount Pleasant Colliery. His\\ncase was that a small stream of water which ran through\\nhis and other lands in that neighbourhood had been ren-\\ndered unfit for uso bj- tho deposit of n largo quantity of\\nslocOc coal from the collierj\\' in question, ana that his farm\\nhad boen otherwise injured from the samo cause. Tho\\ndefendants\\' caso was that there had been no such injury,\\nand that although the creek might have boon partially fillod\\nup by slack coal, this had not been the result of any care\\nlossnoss on tho part of tho emploj-ccs at the colliery, but of\\nn land slip, the result of a flood, for which tho defendants\\nwere not responsible. The evidenco was very voluminous,\\nand in\\'many respects very conflicting. Tho amount really\\nin question was a small one, but tho object of tho contest\\nwas rather, it would appear, to determine tho genorol ques-\\ntion whether or not tho proprietors of cool mines in that\\ndistrict were to be held responsible for damages of this cha-\\nracter. According to the plaintiff and his witnesses the\\ncreek had clearly been damaged by the presence of a\\nquantity of slack coal which hod como down from an\\nimmense henp noar the mouth of the mine-a result bl ought\\nabout by the carelessness of the minors in allowing bo vast\\nan accumulation at such a place. Tho supply of water from\\nthis creek had previously been regular ana abundant. Tho\\nwater, although a littlo hard for washing purposes, hail\\nbeen excellent for every other kind of domestic use, but\\nsince the conl had come down it had been quito useloss.\\nTho waterholes had boen completely filled up, so that the\\nconstancy of tho supplj- of water was to it great extent put\\nan end to, and such as was still to bo had was very bad.\\nThe flood, too, bad carried tho slack coal over some of tho\\ncultivated land, and hod destroj-cd or damaged tho crops.\\nCook had about forty head of cattle which had boen accus-\\ntomed to drink at this stream, but which could\\nnow scarcely use ii. He had boon compelled\\ntherefore to sink a well. Ho had offered to toke \\xc2\\xa320\\nin full compensation for these injuries, and for this sum to\\nclear out the bed of tho creek himself, but tho defendants\\nhad refused lo give him that amount and had offered only\\n\\xc2\\xa310. According to tho defendant\\xc2\\xab\\' wltnosses the water of\\nthis creek, which had always been a littlo brackish,.had\\nbeen in no way injured by tie influx of slack coal, which\\nwas far less than had been represented, and was occasioned\\nsolely by a landslip during a flood which hod brought down\\nat the samo time a largo quantity of soil. The spread of\\nslack coal over tho land to a small extent had rather a\\ntendency to increaso its productiveness than otherwise, and\\ntho catUo had in no way suffered. The^offer of \\xc2\\xa310 had\\nbeen tendered, it was sworn, without prejudico-that is to\\nsay without admitting any liability-and only in tho hope\\nby dealing liberally with tho plaintiff to save all trouble and\\nexpense. Samples of tho water from . this\\ncreek were exhibited in Court, whioh sample\\xc2\\xab\\npresented a very uninviting appearance. It was contended\\ntint they had not been fairly token, but that the water must\\nhavo been btorcd up, but this was denied. Some of this water\\nwas analysed by Mr. Watt, from whose evidence it would\\nappear that its\" foulness aid not in all probability result\\nfrom tho presence of coal, but from that of organic matter.\\nIt further appeared that watcrcrcsscs wore growing plen-\\ntifully in the creek, and that decomposed vegetable matter\\nmight in dry weather help to make the water bad. Tho\\nwater of the creek, according to Mr. Watt, was naturally\\nbrackish, and tho slack coal from this\\'mino when settled\\n(as it. would, settle) ,at. tho bottom of theiBtreain when\\n\\' \\'net flowing rapidly- would\\'\\xc2\\xab not pollute it as alleged.\\nThere was nirtfccr evidence that a stream of water coming\\n.ut of the same seam of coal was quite pure, and was con-\\nstantly used for domestic purposes. Seme of the coal was\\nbroken up in Court and placed in tumblers ef water, upon\\nwhich it left a slight scum, although without otherwiso\\nrendering the water apparently impure. The impurity, J\\nhowever, va\\xc2\\xab most positively \\xc2\\xabvom to by the plaintiff\\'\\xc2\\xab *\\n**\"?\"-~-i _.\\n.witnosBcs. Somo evidence was gone into on the part of tho\\nI ?\\'_.nti(T lo show that tho lond-slip, if it did canso tho dam-\\nage (which was denied), lind been the result of some mis-\\nmanagement of tho excavation. This was mot by direct\\ncontradiction on tho(pnrt of tho defendants. Tho ovidenco\\nwas directly contradictory na to the quantity of slack coal\\nin tbo heap nenr the colliery, and in nearly ovcry other im-\\nportant particular, even \\xc2\\xa1is to tho local features of tho\\ngi omul.\\nHis IIokoh directed the jury that the plain ques-\\ntion for their deteniiiuation was whothor or not tho\\nplaintiff hnd mndo ont any claim to damages for\\ninjurj\" sustained by him through any want oi duo core on\\ntho p\\'nrt of tho defendants\\' employes. Evory man had a\\nright to work n coal mine, but ho was bound so to monago\\nit as that his neighbours should not bo injured. Against\\nlend slips nud floods no amount of caro could guarel ; but\\ntho miners wero bound to exctciso duo caro and forethought\\nso ns when buch accidents took placo their neighbours\\nmight bo \\xc2\\xabs little injured as possiblo by any escapo from tho\\nminc.\\nThe jury, without leaving tho box, found a verdict for the\\ndefi\\'iidnnts.'\n",

      " '. Ofce Ss\\xc3\\xb6nca iWorn\\xc3\\xadtts jQerattu\\nTHURSDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1871.\\nTHE terrible events of Paris have set all\\npersons accustomed to inquire into the causes\\nof things to endeavour to expound those which\\nHave led to this fearful episode in the history\\nof civilization. The strength of the rebellion\\nand the destruction which it wrought, the\\nterrible sacrifice of life in its suppression,\\nand the apparent reappearance of its elements\\nin another form, have filled the world with\\nwonder and with alarm. \"Where is it all to\\nend?\\nThe highest form of civilization existing in\\nEurope has, by common consent, been attri-\\nbuted to Paris. The moat perfect examples\\nof skill, both in science and in art, have been\\nfurnished by its population. It was the most\\nbeautiful city, and had the greatest range of\\npleasures of every kind, and in the most perfect\\norder. Europe received from the French\\ntheatre its popular plays, It received from\\nthe same source its universal fashions. Luxury\\npf all kinds was carried to the highest per-\\nfection in Paris. Nowhere was the art of\\ncookery capable of producing such diet. In no\\n\\'country could all the adornments of the house,\\nof the person, of the table, be so readily\\n\\'assembled. The rich people of eveiy nation\\nhastened to Paris to partake of these splen-\\ndours and these pleasures, which continued\\nthroughout the season without intermission.\\nThe citizens of this great metropolis of gaiety\\nand enjoyment looked with complacency on the\\n. gathering of all people to pay homage to their\\nintelligence, skill, and boundless resources.\\n.Those who look back two or three years to\\n\\'what Paris was-say, when the Great Exhibi-\\ntion attracted all the world-and what Paris\\nhas become, may well be stunned with aston-\\nishment or moved with pity. All this\\nsplendour and plensure passed away, and the\\ncity finally fell under the power of its lowe\\xc3\\x9ft\\ninhabitants, who endeavoured to gain its con\\ntiol, to subject its wealth, its intelligence, its\\nrefinement, all it possessed, to a domination\\nwhich, when embodied in the persons of\\nihose who wielded it, strikes the mind with\\nabsoluta terror.\\nA splendid paper has been contributed to\\nthe Revue des Deua Mondes, by M. E. CAKO,\\non one phase of this great phenomenon,\\nentitled, \" The End of Bohemia, or the lite-\\nrary Influences in these Last Events.*\\' This\\ntreatise attributes the Communist Revolution\\nto the ascendancy of that class created by the\\nrefinements and the yicissitudes of the great\\ncity. A Bohemian signifies, in French phrase,\\na writer living by ephemeral literature, an in-\\nferior artist of any kind, a member of the\\nmedical or legal orders without patients or\\nclients.-any person, in short, thrown upon\\nthe casualties of a calling, and dependent\\nday by day upen the fluctuating success of a\\nprofession. It is from this class have arisen\\nthe writers who have corrupted, or at least\\nexpressed the \\xc2\\xa1corruption of, Parisian society.\\nI They are principally persons who have no\\nrecognised position, no established reputation,\\nwho live day by day having this question\\ncontinually recurring, Where shall we dine, and\\nhow shall we pay for our meal ? They live on\\nthe margin of society, in isolation. They are\\ndevoured by envy. Their chances are an\\nelection to the academy of France, or a place in\\nthe hospital or^in the morgue. These persons,\\nhaving no recognised status in society, have\\nmade themselves the expounders of every senti-\\nment which divides and corrupts it. They\\nhave produced a literature only copied faintly\\n| in the English publications. All the bad\\npassions of mankind have been analysed and\\nlaid open in the mocking tone of those who share\\nthem, who have boasted of them, and who haye\\nbeen destroyed by them. They have professed\\nno moral principle, they have offered no ideal,\\nthey have animuted no effort for the improve-\\nment of mankind. They have put, without\\ndisguise, the defects and disordeis of society\\ninto the language of derision, and, while they\\nhave lessened the respect for human nature\\nas a whole, they ha\\\\e been equally opposed to\\nall those institutions which have been de-\\nsigned to raise the fallen and solace the dis-\\ntressed. Their lessons have been intended to\\nexcite a hatred against the persons of men, an\\nenvy of their good fortune, and of those\\nsuperiorities which arise from knowledge or\\nindustry. The only tone in which they have\\nbeen known to addiess the unhappy portions\\nof society has been calculated not to relieve\\nbut to exasperate their resentment. They\\nhave said to the vicious that they have been\\nmade so by the organization of society; to\\nthose who have found it difficult to live, that\\nthe rich have taken away their natural right to\\ntheir portion in this world. All that society\\nhas secured by united labour foi the go\\xc2\\xbbd of\\nthe State has been treated as deductions from\\nthe daily enjoyment of the workman. The\\nemployers of labour have been always spoken\\nof as criminals, who are joined together in con-\\nspiracy against the operatives.\\nThe consequence of thiB kind of \"education,\\ncontinued for twenty years under the shadow\\nof an Imperial system, was to produce a fixed\\nhatred of everything that existed and a\\ndesperate determination to reverse, to over\\ntlnow, and to sweep all that had been ex-\\nhibited as the representative of wealth or dis-\\ntinction. It is this literature which has found\\nin tiie daily Press a full development for the\\nlast two years. The relaxation of the\\nlaws and the fall of the Empire gave\\nstill fuller scope for these opinions.\\nThe conduct of many prominent persons\\nafforded the text of satire and denunciation.\\nDuring the siege of Paris the clubs were j\\nruined, and the Bohemian class made them the\\nmedium of their propagandism. Men, women,\\nand children attended these assemblies, and\\nthe most extravagant oratory found the\\nwarmest reception. There were two classes of\\nspeakers. Commonly the orators of the work-\\ning class had somo degree of sincerity. But the\\nold leaders weie mete actors ; they were\\n. obtaining a living or a place without any\\nfaith in the principles which they proclaimed.\\nThey had experienced a long trial of patience.\\nTheir contribution* to the Press could not in\\nordinary times provide them with bread. The\\nrevolution carne lo float them upon the surface.\\nWhen the Commune was proclaimed they\\nseized its guidance. They appropriated\\nthe profits upon which they could\\nlay their hands, and, without believing in the\\npermanence of anything, turned to present\\naccount the wild rage of those who were\\nincapable of discerning their delusions. The\\nnumber of men of this class who assumed\\nomeo in the Commune was remarkable. They\\nhad a degree of education, of science, and\\nknowledge of society, but they had long been\\nnmong the disinherited. What a change,\\nthen, to become, even for three months, the\\ndignitaries of a great city, and to command\\nan army of 100,000 men.\\nA remarkable development of the Commune\\nwas the prominence it gave to some female\\npoliticians. The emancipation of woman was\\na grand cry. Lectures were delivered and\\njournals published by them in this interest.\\nThe incidents of the last revolution show how\\nfrightful was the demoralisation of Communist\\nwomen. i\\nAmong the stimulants of mischief with\\nwhich the Bohemian had been long familiar\\nis to be reckoned the use of absinthe. This\\ndangerous liquor produces a special kind of\\nfrenzy more pernicious than ordinary spirits,\\nand more maddening than opium. It is im-\\npossible to say how far even this agent of\\nhuman degradation is responsible for the crimes\\nof the revolution.\\nThe author attributes the character of this\\ninsurrection to the utter absence of religious\\nprinciple in the Bohemian class. While the\\nsavons and philosophers have been propound-\\ning the doctrines of atheism in elegant lan-\\nguage, and as the means of liberating the\\nmind from all prejudices, the lower classes\\nof writers have accepted their conclusions, and\\nsurrounded them with all the decorations of\\nan obscene literature. Every excitement to\\nthe indulgence of the passions has been pro\\n\\xc2\\xa1 duced in their writings ; and their whole\\ns) stem - has been based on negations. Is\\nthere a GOD? No. Is there a future\\nstate\\'? No. IS there a soul? No. Is\\nthere responsibility for tinknown actions\\'?\\nThere is none. Is theie any compensation\\nfor patient suffering? Never. Is there any\\nreason for the relations of social life ? No\\nThese have been the set of principles with\\nwhich Communism has started There are\\nnumbers who have professed to substitute\\nothers for them ; but these at present have\\nremained in all their deadly influence, and\\nhav\\xc3\\xb6 shown themselves in the terrible events\\nof this last civil war.\\nAN , interesting discussion took place a few\\n.months ago in the Ilouse of Commons in\\nrelation to harbours of refuge on the English\\ncoast. The question involved the considera-\\ntion of a large variety of facts, commercial,\\nhumanitarian, and national. The debate arose\\non a motion by Lord C. J. HAMILTON, whose\\nobject was to obtain a grant of public\\nmoney for the construction of a harbour of\\nrefuge at Filey in Yorkshire. The policy\\nof making further grants of public money\\nto construct and improve harbours of refuge\\non the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland\\nhad been the subject of inquiry and solici-\\ntation during the previous fourteen years.\\nA committee recommended that national money\\nshould be granted for the construction\\nof harbouis of refuge, and that funds\\nshould also be voted towards the extension\\nand improvement of existing harbours. It\\nwas also proposed that a commission of\\ninquiry should -visit the coast for the pur-\\npose of inquiry. This was delayed by\\nchange of Government ; but the commis-\\nsioners having been appointed, brought up\\na report recommending that \\xc2\\xa32,365,000\\nshould be granted, with loans at a low\\ntate of interest for harbours, on condition\\nthat cci tain stated local suma should be\\nraised to meet the national grants. These\\nfacts were stated by Lord HAMILTON, who\\nalso gave an account of the numerous\\nattempts which had been made in vain to\\ngive practical effect to the report of the\\ncommissioners, which, however, was opposed\\non the ground that it was \" altogether too\\nsweeping.\" Mr. MILNER GIBSON, when Pre-\\nsident of the Board of Trade, incurred con-\\nsiderable odium by his opposition, and when\\nsailors were drowned on the coast, there\\nwere those who did not hesitate to speak\\nof the widows of those unfortunate\\nseamen, as \" MILNER GIBSON\\'S widows.\"\\nAttempts to induce the House to adopt the\\nreport of the commissioners were renewed in\\neach session from 1862 to 1865, and the sub-\\nject was revived in 1866 and 1869, but without\\nany results satisfactory to its promoters.\\nAmong the commercial facts adduced during\\nthe debate it was stated that the trade was\\nmost extensive on the north-east coast, and\\nthat its harbours were barred, and there-\\nfore not approachable at all tides. It was\\nghen in e-vidence that the entire tonnage of\\nBritish sailing vessels clearing coastwise from\\nports in England was 8,162,000 tons ; coast\\nwajs and foreign together, 15,796,00<>; and\\nthat the annual loss to the nation by wrecks\\nivas a million and a half sterling. But since\\nthat e\\\\idcnce was given there had been a very\\nlaige increase in the foreign as well as in\\nthe coasting trade. The total foreign and\\ntoasting trade in 1857 was 23,178,782 tons\\n(Blitish ships), or an average per month\\nof 1,931,565 tons. But in February of the\\npresent year, the total foreign and coasting\\ntrade was 5,156,000 tons. Taking the coasting\\ntrade only there was a considerable increase\\nshown. In 186-9, the coasting trade for the\\nmonth of February showed 2,587,000- tons.\\nIn February, 1871, it represented 2,684,900\\ntons. Lord HAMILTON, speaking of the\\nfisheries on the coast, quoted from the report\\no\\xc3\\xad the Commissioners of Fisheries in 1866,\\nto show that the annual value of the fisheries\\non the east coast was \\xc2\\xa32-,000,000, and that\\n\"the north-east coast fisheries were of the\\nsame extent as the supcrfitial area of\\nIreland, and were annually increasing in\\nvalue to the extent of \\xc2\\xa310,000 per\\nannum.\" The Boaid of Trade re-\\nturn showed, iL that the number of re-\\ngistered fishing boats in England was 16,195,\\nrepresenting 127,013 tons, and employing\\nI 47,290 men, and 7467 boys.\"\\nThese figures, indicating the large commercial\\ninterest at stake, were not disputed, and facts\\nwere given te show how gieat are the advan-\\ntages which may be expected from an improve-\\nment of the harbours on the coast. As in this\\ncolony in regard to railways, so there appears\\nto have been in the House of Commons on\\nthis matter much local rivalry, and\\nthe question divided itself into two main\\nbranches - first, as to the expediency\\nof spending large sums of money on one\\nharbour of refuge, when (it was arguod)\\n\" unless \\'.they were multiplied almost ad\\nw\\xc3\\x9fnitum they would be of very little use;\" |\\nand, second, as to how far Government\\nassistance ought to be extended towards the\\nimprovement of harbours. It was stated by\\none member that the Government had advanced\\nmoney on easy terms to the Tyne Harbour\\ncommisioners. Another observed that the\\nsum of \\xc2\\xa31,600,000 had been spent during the\\nlast few years in improving the approach to\\nthe Tyne Uiver so as to render it a good\\nharbour of refuge ; that most of the\\nmoney was made a local charge ; and\\nthat, in consequence of the improvements\\neffected, a herring fishery had been estab-\\nlished there. By an Act passed in 1861,\\nmoney may be granted for harbour improve-\\nments on condition that it be repaid, with\\ninterest, in twenty years. The Tyne Harbour\\ncommissioners had availed themselves of\\nthese harbour loans; but it was remarked\\nthat they had not done so to such an ex\\nlent as they would otherwise have been\\nglad to do had the interest not been in-\\ncreased. They obtained \\xc2\\xa3100,000 at 3J per\\ncent., and another \\xc2\\xa3100,000 at 3.J per cent. ;\\nbut the Government after that refused to\\nlend to them at less than 5 per cent.,\\nand the commissioners became reluctant to\\nborrow on those terms.\\nFrom a national standpoint it was argued\\nthat Filey ought to bo made a harbour of\\nrefuge. It was contended that the events\\nof the past few months had altogether\\naltered the military position of the country;\\nthat England had now to look for danger\\nnorn the East, and that therefore the |\\nconstruction of a naval station on the east\\ncoast was a matter of serious moment. It\\nwas also remarked by the mover that\\nFiley was recommended by the committee of\\n1857 from a strategetical point of view-1\\nthat it would be good as a look-out, and\\nsafe for shipping in time of war. Several\\nauthorities were quoted showing the import-\\nance of a naval station on the east coast,\\nand these were supplemented by arguments\\nbased on local considerations.\\nThe humanitarian reasons urged recall the\\ndangers and sacrifices annually made in the\\ncause of commerce and navigation - the\\nterrible disasters which occur to vessels baffled\\nby winds and unable to weather rocky\\npoints - ships with torn sails and broken\\nmasts left to the fury of a gale - the\\nfoundering of vessels unable to find a\\npott of refuge, and long lines of coast\\nblack with wreck. The members were\\nreminded of \" scenes of agony which\\nbeggared description,\" and certainly the loss\\nof life shown is most lamentable. All this\\nwas admitted by the Government. Mr.\\nGLADSTONE quoted from a Parliamentary\\npaper the number \\xc2\\xa9f shipwrecks which had\\noccurred during eleven years, showing that\\n1480 lives had been lost on the south coast,\\n1240 on the north coast, and 2772 in the\\nIrish Sea. But the inference he drew from\\nthe figures was, that there was no\\nmaterial diff\\xc3\\xa9rence to be traced be-\\ntween those portions of the coast which\\nhad harbours of refuge, and those which had\\nnot. The policy of the Government was\\nclearly stated to be in favour of an improve-\\nment in the mercantile marine, and it was\\nheld that a reckless plan for a wholesale\\ncreation of bar-harbours would have the effect\\nof retarding that improvement. It was argued,\\nhowever, on the other side, that much re-\\nmained yet to be done, inasmuch as it could\\'\\nnot be denied, in the face of wrecks so\\nnumerous, that many ships went to sea in\\nan unsafe condition.\\nBut the most fatal objection to the propo-\\nsition appeared to be its local- application ;\\nand upon this point Mr. GLADSTONE and\\nMr. LOWE spoke out boldly. The former\\nsaid he could not do otherwise than euter\\nhis protest against local propositions of the\\nkind, \" because they were a fruitful source\\nof political demoralization.\" Mr. LOWE said :\\n-\" The noble mover did not propose to fol-\\nlow the general spirit of the recommendation\\nof the Commission, but picked out one iso-\\nlated point, with respect to which the Consoli-\\ndated Fund was to contribute all, and local\\nresources nothing. A more fatal blow, not\\nonly at the Exchequer, but at the reputation\\nof that House, could not be imagined. He\\nhad some experience on such a point. He had\\nbeen a member of a Colonial Assembly, the\\ngreatest part of the time of which was taken\\nup in discussing measure\\xc2\\xbb such as the noble\\nlord now proposed, involving the application\\nof general revenue to local purposes, such as\\nthe making of a road in one place, or the con-\\nstruction of a railway in another. The main\\ntime of the Legislature was occupied in that\\nmost discreditable manner, and he, therefore,\\nventured from practical experience to warn\\nthe House not to encourage such motions as\\nthe present, for it would find no course so\\ninjurious to the respect and estimation it\\nshould be held in by the \\'public as countenanc-\\ning the grant out of the general revenue of the\\ncountry of money to be expended for local\\npurposes.\"\\nTUB SYDNEY MONTHLY OVERLAND MAIL.\\nThe Summary of colonial DOWS for transmission to\\nEurope by the Btoomship Kaugoon will bo published in this\\njournal to-uiorrow (Friday) morniagi tho Cth instant.\\nAdvertisers are particularly requested to send in their\\nfavours early this (Thursday) ovening.

Later events\\nhave shown still more clearly that the\\nwhole\\'Question requires, to, be more carefully\\nlooked into, and that contingencies may aribe\\nwhich,involve doubt as to whether they have\\nbeen adequately (as they have not been ex-\\npressly) .forseen and provided for.\\n- Ihe difficulty in Ifew South Wales arose\\nfrom doubts as to whether the telegram from\\nthe Secretary of State, which the Govern-\\nment interpreted as \\'constructively sanctioning\\ntheir arrangements,<,was sufficient to cure tha\\nomission on the part of the Queen\\'s instruc-\\ntions or commission to provide expressly for\\nthe absence of the \\'Governor during a longer\\nperiod than a month without \\xc2\\xbfailing in ai\\nActing-Governor to take his place. The\\ndifficulty in Victoria was not as to the\\nswearing in of Sir Redmond Babiiy. That\\nwas disposed of by the force of circumstances\\nwhich left the Ministry but one course to\\nfollow. The difficulty there arose from tho\\nabsence of the Chief Justice (the Acting-Go-\\nvernor designate) at the time when an Acting\\nGovernor had to be sworn in, and from his\\nreturn whilst the duties of the office were being\\ndischarged by the senior Judge, the official\\ndesignated by the commission to take the\\noffice if the Chief Justice were ab.ent.\\nWas Sir W. Stawell, the Chief Justice, to\\nassume the Acting-Governorship on his return,\\nor was Sir Redmond Baeiiy, in whom the\\npowers of Governor were legally vested, to\\nretain and exercise them ? Doubt was felt\\namongst the lawyers as to whether the power*\\nof the commission under which Sir Redmond\\nBakey had been appointed were not exhausted\\nbj his appointment. These doubts, however,\\nwere overruled. Sir W. Stawell was sworn\\nin on the 11th, Sir Rldmond Bakry art\\nministering the .oaths. And it is said that in\\nthe event of any embarrassment occurring,\\na telegram will be sent to London, asking for\\n[the execution of a fresh commission.\\nAs this is cutting the Gordian knot, instead\\nof untying it-a process thati may be ver)\\n\\xc2\\xa1agreeaole to ,\\'Ministries tin Victoria, but is\\nhardly excusable\\' on constitutional \\'principles-~\\nthe difficulty remains still undisposed of. Let\\nus, then, inquire into its nature more closely,\\nThe Argus describes Sir W. Stawell as\\n\" assuming \" the administration of the Govern-\\nment, But how was it possible for hira to\\nassumo it ? Did Sir Redmond Barry give it\\nup, or was it taken from him, or did it pass\\nfrom him by the operation of the commission? I\\nThe last supposition is untenable. If Sir\\nGroROE Bowen had leturned before Sir W.\\nStawell, this sort of self-acting transfer i\\nwould certainly have taken place. Sir Red- I\\nmond Barry having become Acting-Governor\\nduring the Governor\\'s absence only,- the\\nGoveinor, in viitue of his own commission^\\nwould have resumed his full powers on te\\nentering the territory of Victoria aB a matter of\\ncourse. Sir George Bowen was Governor\\nbefore he left, was Governor whilst absent, and\\nwould have been Governor on his return, his\\ncommission having been neither cancelled nur\\nwithdrawn, but simply suspended as to its\\noperation during his absence. Not so with\\nSir W. Stawell. He \"assumed\" the ad-\\nministratorship ; he did not resume it, because\\nit was not his to resume. He had not held it\\nbefore. If he had held it before, and had then\\nleft the colony, and if Sir Redmond\\nBarry had then become administrator\\nin his place, there would have been\\nan analogy between the two cases, and Sir\\nW. Stawell might have claimed, like the\\nGovernor, the right to resume the powers\\nwhich by his absence he had become tempo-\\nrarily incapable of exercising. As it was,\\nwhen he reiurned, he returned as Chief Justice,\\nnot as Acting-Governor. He could not become\\nActing-Governor till he was Bworn in. He\\ncould only take office by assumption, not\\nby resumption, as Sir George Bowen\\ncould. Sir George Bowen, on returning,\\nwould have resumed power as Sir George\\nBowen in virtue of a personal appointment\\nby a commission still operative. Sir W.\\nStawell could neither reaBon1 nor assume aa\\nSir W. Siawell. lie had not been\\npersonally named in any commission. And the\\nonl} circumstances under which he could have\\nclaimed a right to assume the administratorship\\nas Chitf Justice-as the official designated to\\nfill the vacant office-were manifestly when the\\noffice wat, \\\\acant. But was it vacant? \\' !\\nAi Sir Rj.dmo\\xc3\\xaesd Barry was not absent on\\nSii W. t>TAWH.L\\'s return, and not suffering\\nIrom incHpucitv, a vurancy could not have\\nexistid unless he had been deprived of the\\noffice or resigned it. But, having taken the\\noaths, \\xc2\\xabho was.to deprive him of the office had]\\nlie chocen to hold it, adopting Marsh ii\\nMacMamon\\'s motto, \"J\\'y suts;j\\'y reslc\\'1\\'\"\\nHe could have held his footing in\\nthe Malakhofi\\' agnvnst anybody short\\nof the Secretary of Stnte. The sup;\\nposition, then, is that ho re_igned.(\\nBut will that resignation hold together on\\'\\nbeing shaken ? When Sir George Bowen\\nleft the colon), he did not resign the Gover-I\\nnort-hip. He simply went away, and left the\\noffice to fall into the hands of the official first\\nI in rank designated to fill itj\\' whensoever\\n\\'hat official should he duly eworn in J\\n[ But Sir Redmond Barky did hot go away.]\\nIf he resigned, he resigned and still\\nremained, able, if not willing, to discharge the\\nduties of the office. But had he the powei\\'\\nthus to resign and remain? He_ was, bo to,\\nspeak, seised of the business of administration,\\nand had he a right of his own motion to relieve\\nhimself of it, and hand o\\\\er his duties to\\nanother who, bo long as Sir Redmond was\\nActing-Governor, was his subordinate ? If Sir\\xc2\\xa1\\nGeorge Bowen had resigned he would have\\'\\nsent in his resignation to his superior officer,)\\nthe Secretary of State, and have awaited\\nhis reply. Sir Redmond Barry, derivingj\\nhis authority as Acting-Governor from the\\nsame source, could presumably resign it only\\nin the same manner. Resignation, apart from\\nsupervening incapacity, implies a reference^\\nto an authority competent to accept or decline\\xc2\\xab\\nit. But there was no such authority in Vic-\\ntoria in Sir Redmond Barry\\'s case. He\\ncould not tender his resignation to the j\\nMinistry, for their status was not superior;\\nto his own. When once he had been,\\ns worn in, they were rather under his\\nauthority than he under theirs. He could not\\ntender it to Sir W. Stawell, of whom\\nas defacto Governor, whilst Sir W. Stawell,\\nwas only Chief Justice, he took precedence.\\'\\nOn the whole, the theory of resignation seems\\nas little tenable as that of transfer by the mere\\nforce of the commission, which, if our reasoning\\nbe correct, could only have taken place if Sir1\\nW. Stawell had been the Acting-Governor,\\nfirst sworn in, and had returned after a tem-*\\nporary absence, during which Sir Redmond i\\nBarry had been his hourn (mens. A j\\nvacancy might have been created readily]\\nerpugh, ifSir Redmond Barry, who is now I\\nin New South Wales, had arranged for an\\'\\nearlier i isit, and quitted Victoria the day before \\'\\nSir W. Stawell\\'s arrival, or if the Govern-\\nment had delayed swearing in Sir W.\\nStawell until after his departure. But he\\nremained, and the question is, how while he\\nremained could the office become legally\\nvacant ? \\'\\nIt appears to ,us that, just as it was only\\nthough the absence of Sir W. \\'Stawell\\nwhen an Acting-G o vernon ,was required, that\\nSir Redmond Barry obtained the office, bo,\\nwhen Sir\\'Redmond Barry had once obtained\\nit and been duly sworn in, it was only by his\\ndeparture from t the colony, or by supervening\\nincapacity, that Sir W. Stawell could rightly\\nassume it. \\' Sir Redmond Barry became\\nActing-Governor because the swearing\\nin of an Acting-Governor was requirod\\nby , the public interest. But no such\\nnecessity aroBe. on the return of Sir\\nW. Stawell, because the office had been\\nfilled and itB duties were being discharged\\' in\\nthe manner provided hy the Royal Instructions\\nund Commission. The provisions of the Com-\\nmission and the Instructions were intended to\\nshow how a vacant office was to be filled, and\\nnot, when the office had been duly filled, to\\ncreate a vacancy in order to substitute another\\nofficer for the one in whom the powers attach-\\ning to the position legally vested.\\n\\\\ Wir at a mine of wealth there would be in the\\n\\\\inej aids of Australia if only we had a market\\nI under our lee, such as France has in Europe.\\nI\\'the day may come perhaps when in America,\\n\\xc2\\xa1if not in Europe,, Australian wines maybe a\\npopular drink, but at the present time the costs\\n\\'of production and carriage aVe against us, and\\ndhe reputation \\'of our vineyards and wine\\nicellsrs is not high enough, and in the main the\\n! market for Australian wines is still in Aus-\\ntralia. *\\nj As some compensation for the disasters it has\\n\\'latelv undergone, France was last year blessed\\nwith an unusually splendid vintage. Notwith-\\nstanding the oidium, notwithstanding the\\n\\xc2\\xa1phjlloxera, and notwithstanding hailstorms,\\n\\'the vintage was productiv e to an extent which\\nhas only once been equalled, and that was in\\n\\xc2\\xa1the year 18G9. The produce is estimated at\\n170,000,000 of hectolitres, and sr a hectojitre ;s\\nTwentr-two-1-4 gallons,\" tt\\xc3\\xadiB\\'Ms \"s equal1\\'* to\\'\\n1,540,000,000 gallons. The growth of\\nthe trade out of which France makes\\nso much money will be visible by |\\nnoticing tViat in 1854, that is only twenty years\\nago, the product was only eleven millions of\\nhectolitres; in tho following year it rose to\\nfifteen; during the eleven years from 1863 to\\n1878 inclusive, it rose to an average of fifty\\nthree millions ; \"but in 1873, which was a very\\nbad j ear, it dropped to thirty-six millions, and\\nnow, in the following year, it is very nearly\\ndouble, hating risen to seventy millions.\\nThere are only ten departments in France\\nwhich produce no wine, and the vine covers\\n4} per cent, of the whole surface of the\\ncountry, or in round numbers about five million\\nacres. There are, however, three chief wine-\\ngrowing districts, namely the Bordelais, Bur-\\ngundy, and Champagne, and the produce from\\nthose districts has not yet been rivalled by any\\nother part of the world. The number of\\npeople employed in thia industry is in propor-\\ntion to the acreage covered, for it is reckoned\\nto give occupation to no fewer than seven\\nmillion labourers ; that is to say, one industry\\nin .France alone, and that an industry which\\nproduces an article of luxury, finds wages for\\nmore than three times the whole population of\\nAustralasia. \\'\\nNor is there any fear at present of France\\nover-producing. There is an indefinite market\\nfor all the good wine that is made, although it\\nis possible that a great or sudden glut might to\\nsome extent lower the price, in order to allow\\n.-?ales to be effected rapidly. But in its wine\\nFiance has an article which tbe world\\neagerly buys ; and, as the world is grow-\\ning richer every year, and becoming more\\nand more luxurious, there is more and\\nmore eager demand for wines of the\\' best\\nquality. In this way, France is taxing the\\nwhole world to help it to pay its debts ; and\\neveryone who sips his claret or his champagne\\nassists towards the pa} ment of that satisfaction\\'\\nwhich Bismarck and Von Moltkk exacted. <\\nIt is impossible not to notice in this yield of\\n(he French vineyards how much the commerce\\nof the world has gained by the greater humanity\\nof modern methods of war. When we read\\nancient history, we hear of conqueTorB who\\n..eemtd insatiable in their revenge, who razed\\ncities to the ground, and who ploughed up the\\ncultivated fields and sprinkled them with salt.\\'\\nand who seemed never to be able to do enough\\nlo tatisfy themselves that the people who had\\npiovoked their wrath should be ruined hope-\\nlessly. If the samo spirit had animated modern\\nwar-if the Germans, not content with conqu_\\nluig, had sought only to devastate-if they,\\nhad pulled up the vines and destroyed\\nthe wine-presses, in how different a\\nsituation would France have been! How\\nheavy would have been the pressure of\\nthe taxation, and how cramped the resources\\nlo meet that taxation. What numbers would\\nhave been out of employment, and what years\\nwould have been waited by capitalists till vines\\ncould have been replanted and again become\\nproductive ! But, as it was, the German occu-\\npation did. not appreciably affect the vintage,\\nwhich even, during the disastrous year of th\\xc3\\xa7\\nwar kept up its\\'\\'average. <** * ,\\nIt is quite true that this more humane pian\\nmils the conqueror quite as well as it suits* thfct\\nconquered. The victor takes it out in monej\\ninptead of having his payment in revenge. lV\\nGeimany had destroyed the productive industij\\'\\nof France, it would have had to content itself\\nwith a far smaller indemnity. The credit of\\nFrance would have been too prostrate for it io\\nhave raised the necessary loans with the\\'\\npromptness that it did, and Germany i1-\\'\\niewar.de,d for not having destroyed French \\xc2\\xa1\\nvineyards by the receipt of hundreds of million\\xc2\\xab\\nof French gold. Doubtless to a Christian\\nspiiit this mode of re\\xc3\\xad enge is more satisfactory,\\nand to the wine-drinkers of the world it is moie\\nsatisfactory also.\\nIt is impossible also in connection with this\\nsubject not to notice how much of the wealth \\',\\nof France is due to it being a producer for the\\nluxury of the world. In the way of exporting\\nthe necessaries of life it does not do mucn,.\\nand produces mainly for its own popu-\\nlation. It exports but little of com\\' or of\\nmeat ; but with regard to all that comforts the\\nstomach or adorns the person, France stands\\nin the first rank of producers. It is the grand\\npurveyor of luxury, and, in a world that is\\ngetting every year richer and more luxurious,\\nit does not fail to find a splendid market.\\nFrance, though it has no monopoly of the busi-\\nness in luxuries, has the undisputed lea-1.\\nItaly provides many objects of art, and English\\nmanufacturers are improving yearly in tbiii\\nproductions of taste and ingenuity. Still it is to\\nFrance that the world turns for models and foi\\nits choicest objets de luxe; and there seems no\\nlikelihood \\' of its pre-eminence in this depart\\nment being interfered wi li. The French\\nmanipulators seem to have as great an aptitude\\nfor work of this sort as their soil and climate\\nhave aptitude for a special class of wines. The\\ncommercial position of France in these respects\\n| brings it wealth, in spite of all its foreign wai s\\nand its intestine discords, and of the damage in-\\nevitably done to trade when capital is alarmed\\nby insecurity and labour is oppressed bj\\ntaxation.\\nTub Vatican Decbees.-AVe print to-day, on\\nthe sixth page, the first part of the Right Hon.

and,\\nafter describing the benefit which might arise from\\nthis change of name in the way of warding off the\\nperplexities which might arise from any attempt to\\ndefine the evangelical doctrine so as to obtain for the\\ndefinition a universal concurrence, he proceeds thus :\\n-\" There is another argument in favour of our pro-\\nposed title. Its single watchword not only describes\\nvery clearly the qualifications of the proposed mem-\\nbership, but it intimates, with equal clearness, what\\nthe precise work is in which, when brought together\\nand formed into au association, they are expected to\\nengage. It is an alliance in defence of Pro-\\ntestantism. Where there is no danger to be warded\\noff, there might be no reason in pleading for such an\\nassociation as we now advocate, or for its title either.\\nBut who can deny the existence of a most imminent\\nand daily increasing danger r Who eau be ignorant\\nof the bus}- aggressive proselytism and undermining\\npolicy that are now in active operation, under the\\nconduct of agents and emissaries from the Church of\\nKome? Who can be blind to the evidences now\\nspringing up in vnrious lands, that the old priestcraft\\nof the Middle Ages is lifting its head again, and\\nshedding baleful influence over Churches that were\\nwont to boast of theirs being the foremost place, and\\ntheirs the first-rate services in the cause of the\\nglorious Reformation ! Whether the Antichrist that\\nis now reappearing be in the ancient and unmitigateel\\ntorm of Popery, cr in the no less dangerous though\\nmilder form of Puscyism (in these days he would\\nWrite liitualisw), surely there is most urgent call\\nfor vigilance and alarm ; and, should it be made tho\\nfirst and most ostensible object of the Alliance to repel\\nthe inrcads of this threatening mischief, ive are con-\\nfident, if such an undertaking were to give\\nforth its certain sound, that thousands\\n\\xc2\\xa1ind tens of thousands would hasten to\\nits summons, in the sacred cause of religious freedom,\\nand Scriptural Christianity, and the rights of private\\njudgment. It will be miserable indeed, if the hostile\\ndemonstrations from without do not lead us to look\\noutwardly; or if we shall waste our energies on the\\nyet premature attempt to settle the account between\\nthe various modifications and distinctions of Pro-\\ntestantism, when the common enemjr is at the door,\\nand if not met with a systematic and combin\\'d reiistan<~c,\\nmight bury Protestantiim, throughout all its varieties, in\\none common \\xc2\\xbb\\xc2\\xabin. We tell of a distinct thing to be\\ndene, and a distinct thing to correspond about, when\\nwe state how desirable it is to ascertain the statistics\\nof Popery all over the world, and more especially the\\nstatistics of Puseyism and High Churchism (Ritu-\\nalism)-these great feeders of Popery in our Island ;\\nanel furthermore, when we state as most fitting objects\\nfor deliberation, what the best methods aro by which\\nto arrest the progress of the threatening mischief, not\\nonly at home, but in America and the British colonies,\\nand the continent of Europe, and every other place\\nwhere Jesuitism is playing her wiles, and practising\\nwith deadly success her manifold elelusions. Anei\\nreverting to our own affairs, as well as making an ad\\nvance from deliberations to doings, what more patent\\nthan the various methods by which our literary and\\necclesiastical and influential men might arouse the Pro\\n\\\\ testant community of Great Britain, and put our contti\\ntuincKS on the alert ; and also funds for the niultipli\\nI eation of scriptural schools, aud outrival our adver-\\nsaries, who at this moment are labouring with all\\n| their might to obtain possession of the masses by their\\nlinn earied attentions in the houses of the common\\n| pctiple, and doing whatever in them lies to influence and\\nKain 01 cr our heretofore sadly-neglected population.\"\\nThese ure what I understand to be the principles and\\nobjects of Ornngeism-and if they are, I say to the\\nOrangemen-go on and prosper-be true to your\\nprinciples-true to your Bible-loyal to your Queen\\n-obedient to the laws-and brotherly affectioned to\\nall men of every creed, and you need not fear attacks\\nfrom any quarter. It is quite certain that the ranks\\nof the institution will be increased more by the\\nslanders of false brethren than Irom any other cause.\\nI know of nothing which aroused the feeling of quiet\\nsoberminded Protestants so much, as the fact of a man\\nwho calls himself a member of the Church of England\\ndaring in the Legislative Assembly to compare\\nOrangemen with Fenians.\\nBelieving that I have truly stated the principles of\\nOrangeism, and the only objects they have in view,\\nI must say that I never have been able to understand\\nhow it is that loyal subjects of her Majesty-and\\nabove all, men who are sincere Protestants-could\\napply such rancorous language and such insulting\\nepithets as have been applied to those whose only\\ncrime is that they dare to keep in remembrance\\nand to celebrate those great evento which enabled the\\ni late accomplished Lord Macaulay to write, \" It is\\n* because we had a preserving revolution in the seven\\ni teenth century, that, we have not had a destroying\\n\\' revolution in the nineteenth.

Ho could scarcely con-\\nceive anything likely to bo more disastrous than hasty\\nlegislation on thin subject, and it appeared to him that they\\nhad run too rapidly through the measure to give it all tho\\nconsideration its grcut importance demanded. By tho 20th\\nsection of the Church Temporalities Aot, the Bishop of\\nS)dney had power, on caune shown, to revoko the license\\nof ntlergjmnn, indeed, bo took it, this was the section\\nwhich gavo the Bishop general control over the clergy of\\nbia diocese It was now, howevor, proposed to\\ncreate a new tribunal for the trial of cloigy,\\nnot only for ordinary offences, but for doctrinal\\noffences. Ho ventured to say that not five members of tho\\n\\xc2\\xa1>) rod appreciated duly the importance of the stop thus\\nIcing taken The establishment of a tribunal like this re-\\nquired tome little the/Ught before n woll matured decision\\neouldbe arrived at AB the law now stood, tho Bishop of I\\nh)dEoy was the tribunal for tho trial oi theso offences, and\\nit was sought to tako that power from him Why such\\nhnsto 5 Hid thoBishop exorcised unduo proesuroupon tho\\nelerey, or had bo on uny occasion failed in his dut) by\\nmaking inquiry, or bj ubBtaining from inquiry, as to\\ni ffences - lhcro were two or three points in this measure\\nthat required the gruv est consideration. 1 ho third clauto\\nwns the key of the whole bill. It bad boon thought advis-\\nable that this power should be taken from the Bishop, and\\nbe vested m a tribunal If thon it was advisablo to take\\naway this power from tho Bishop, why give the Bishop (as\\nwus provided in the first portion of this clause) the right of\\nan absoluto veto, whether a tlerg)uian should be tried or\\nnot ? Here was a condition proc\\xc3\\xa8dent whereby tho aotion\\nof the tribunal might bo actually barrod. Hereafter wo\\nmight hnvo bishops of opinions stronger or weaker than\\nthoso held by our present Bishop, some of whom\\nun\\xc2\\xa1,ht regard as importnnt mature what others looked upon\\nan trivial, and it win, posible that complaint might properly\\nbe made against a ulcrg) man on a question oi elactnno,\\nwhen a.bithop would veto the charge on tho ground that tne\\ndoctrino complained of was held b) himself, but ostensibly\\ncn tho ground of unimportance He (Mr. Darley) was\\nquite willing (hat tho pou or should be vosted as now in tho\\nhands of the Bishop, bul if ho woro to be deprived of it, do\\nnot let bim have the right to bar tho action of tho tribunal\\nto which his power was transferred This peint did not\\noppear to havo received any consideration at their hands.\\nLy tho next clause it was provided that \" if the onmmittoe\\nshall report that thero is not sufficient ground for the charge\\nmade npainst the accused olerg)mnu, then the Bishop may\\nuletain from taking anv furiher proceeding in the matter.\"\\nHero nn absoluto discretion was vested in tho Bishop, and\\nho might, m spito of the committee\\'s report, proceed\\nagainst theclerg)man Theeowere two matters of princi-\\nple which did not seem to have boen propsrly considered\\nJ here also appeared to be \\xc2\\xaboverol oversights-first, in not\\ncatrying the amendment in clause 7 into clause 8, whore it\\nw OB equally necessary. He had in practice seen tho disas-\\ntrous effects of banty and crudo legislation, and they ought\\nto bear in mind tho possibility of some question in rcferonco\\nto the provisions contained in this ordinance being brought\\nbtforo the Supremo Court The 9th clause provided that,\\n\"If mont cose the accused clorgymanehall rofuso or neg\\nbet to appear either in person or by counsel or agent m\\nobedience to the citation BO issued and served on him as\\nhereinbefore mentioned, tho Tribunal ahall proceod so hoar\\nthe cause in his absence \" Tho condition precedent was\\nrefusal or neglect, there waa no provision in referonce to\\noccident, or inability on account of ill health No doubt it\\nwas provided that a new trial nug) t be granted m case\\njuaneo required it, but it would be a mee question for tho\\njudges to decide whether what had taken place\\nin the nbsenco of the accused could be regarded\\nas a trial or not, when that absence was unavoidable,\\nand whether in case of future proceedings they could be\\nregarded OB a second trial. It might be said this ordinance\\nwas in effect tho copy or transcript of an ordinance in an-\\nother colony, still he conceived that it had not yet received\\nall the requisite consideration. Why take these powers\\nfrom the Bishop and veBt thom in another tribunal, which\\nhod no precedent in any other colony or m tho mother\\nciunlry-(\" Oh, oh \")-consisting of laymen andclericj-a\\ntribunal whose functions were not to bo exercuod unless\\nthe Bishop gave leovo \\' He moved that the third reading\\nbe postponed, in order that membeis might bave timo to\\nconsider tho principles upon which tho measure res\\'ed,\\nTho Rev. Conon AILWOOM seconded tho mot on.\\nThe Rev A H STEPHEN hoped the Synod would hast-\\n\\xc3\\xadate-before acceding to the motion With regard to the\\notjection raised as to hasty legislation, it ought to be borne\\nin mind that this was not an experiment, and it would bo\\nfound that the very points of principio to which Mr Darley\\nteok exception were contained m the English Church\\nDisciplino Act, from which the comunttoo copied\\nlargely. With regard to the Synod being too\\neager to transfer the power which the Bishop had\\nunder Iho Church 1 eraporahties Act, the learned gentle-\\nmen muBt have forgotten a decision of tho Supreme Court,\\nto which an appeal was modo a few years back, when it\\nnae decided that tho Bishop had no power to constitute\\ntuen a tiibunol na that by wbieh the appealing olorgyman\\nbid been tried Iho Svnod now had power unaor her\\nI galised constitutions to relieve the Bishop lrom a position\\nwhich all understood to bo distasteful to him Of tho two\\ninstances in which the learned member objected\\nto prinnples in tho measure, precedents existed\\nin the English Act which had stood the test\\nof experience and which had been adopted by\\nthe Australian Synods It seemed strango too that with a\\ncomplaint against depriving the Bishop of tho power ho\\npoetessed there should be associated an objection to the\\ndiscretion this bill gave to the Bishop That discretion\\nwas allowed in the Church Discipline Act to anv English\\nBishop With regard to the oversight referred to in clause\\n8 tho learned gentleman would perceive, on reading both\\nclauses, that tho amendment m the 7th was not required in\\nthe 8th clause Then, agnn, in the Oth clause tho learned\\ngentleman said there was no provision made for cases of\\nabsence through accident The last lino of tho 8th clause\\ncured any defect of that kind Every clause and line ot\\ntho measure bad been carefully considered, and he hoped\\nthe Synod would not, unless much weightier reasons were\\neli own, consent to tho postponement proposed\\nThe Bov H A PALMEII supported the amendmont and\\nsignified bis approval oi what the mover thereof had said\\nwith regard to hasty legislation He thought thoy had\\nnot sufficient time to consider tho matter, and as m the\\ndivison on tho 8th clause nearly half the clergy present had\\nvoted against it, ho thought that to ask for a postponement\\nwas not too much,

the\\nLusineea before them He would, however, mako a few\\nexplanatory observations with reference to the matters\\ncontained in the report It would be observed by tho com\\ninittto that the clergy had reported various causes ua having\\nltd to the dccrenfe~in the number of mnrriogos celebrated\\n[ ly the clergy of the Church of England, and ho regretted\\nto say that this diminution bad gone on

was, how-\\never, not so v try great, e onMdenng that tbo total decrease\\nin the number of marriages bad been also great But there\\nvue one consideration which ho thought should hftvo

to it in this ws)-from a desire to be married\\nin private If the divine institution of marriage nnd ils\\nclinrnctcr were duly considered, and the solemn responsibi\\nhues connected -with that Holy Ordinance were connilered,\\npeople would not desire this privacy Thoy would feel that\\ntbcro was nothing to bo BBhamed of, they would think\\ntjnt they were going about a very honourable\\nthing,-would desire their friends to be acquainted with\\nwhat thej were going to do, und would not wish to onter\\nFecretly that hoi) stato which vi OB instituted by God at the\\nlepinning of man s eMBtence, and which Scripture bud said\\ntr Lo honourable in nil and symbolical of Christ s Church\\nHe did hofatbat tbo clergy would consider this carelully\\nPn bablv they had been to blamo in not endeavouring to\\ninform their people on thiB suljtct Ho saw no better way\\ne t benefiting them than by informing them of tho ov ii and\\ngiving them more correct views A number of reasons\\nwere, given ne to the causes which had led to thedeciease\\n111 ken of, and amongst them was ono he would refer to,\\nviz, the facilities afforded for pr\\xc3\\xadvalo marriages\\nHo had co doubt that the ministrations of\\nLIB brethren had brought under their notice painful\\ncitcum\\xc2\\xab-tanceB of this nature He remembered one instance\\ncf a young woman leaving the house in which she was a\\nsei vont-ueking permission to go out and seo a friend\\nHermistrcES wos sick in bed , her master was aw ay from\\nbone, and she did not return until II o\\'clock at night,\\nwhen ehe told her mistress that sho was married Ho\\nknew of other persons having been married in the same\\nhiiMv manner. TheEe wero evils, however, that could\\nbat di) be rectified without an alteration in the marriage\\nlim of the colony A great numbor of recommendations\\nhad been made by clergymen, in reply to questions pro\\npofcd to them, and ho would mention them as they were\\npieced before tho Sjnod in tho report. Some proposed\\n\\xc2\\xbb i eduction of the marriage fees, others tho abolition\\nof fees altogether Others proposed that banns\\nt-hculd bo dispensed with altogether, and others that licenses\\nbhould be dispensed with altogether. But the most im\\nrortant recommendation, and one which seemed moro\\nlikdy than any other to havo a practical result was that\\nthe hours should te extended to 8, or half past 8 o\\'clock, in\\nthe evening. He might state that that recommendation\\nproceeded frem a number of clergvmen, some of whom had a\\nci risiderable experience in the colony, and appeared to have\\ngiven the matter a great deal of careful consideration\\nAnother tery important recommendation contained in these\\nicpheB of the clergy was with reference to the necessity\\nfor persons being married in the church of the\\nparish in which one of tho parties resided. This\\nWSB a question which he hoped the committee\\nwould consider very carefully, and be prepared\\nto deal with after that careful deliberation that it deserved,\\n1er his own part, he must eay that he was acquainted with\\ne number of cases m which a great hardship had been felt\\n1 y perEons who wiBhod to be married in another church than\\ni but of their own pariBh. There were, it was true, moana\\nsf getting over this great difficulty. Persons giving notioe\\not their intention of being married in a particular church\\nnnd going to reside for a short time-sovondajs- m tho\\n(arish to which that church belonged, could obtain their\\ndesire Ho knew of such cases \"Very strong feelings had\\nexisted, and be might cay prejudices entertained and unkind\\nfedings generated, by this res notion , and ho did not\\nwonder that the clergy ana tomo of them strongly, pro\\npoied the abolition of this restriction Passing from these\\ngeneral observations, with reference to the cau\\xc2\\xab0B\\nned tbe remedies, he carne to the proposition of the first of\\nthese resolutions, and the resolution he had now to submit\\nto the committee was as follows -\"That this Synod\\nhaving under consideration the report of the committee\\nappointed by the Synod to inquire into the causes which\\nhave operated to bring about tho large diminution which\\nbos taken place in the number of marriages celebrated by\\nthe clergy of the Church of England m this diocese, and\\nto consider and report what measures it is advisable to adopt\\nvnlh a view to remedy the evils resulting from members of\\nthe Church resorting to ministers of other denominations to\\nle matried, resolve that it is expedient -Tirat, that all\\nfetB now charged m connection with the celebration of\\nnmiriBge, whether by banns or license, bo abolished.\\'1\\nMembers would observe that this stood number one on the\\nrecommendations of the committee, and he now proposed\\nthem as resolutions of the Synod. It had appeared to the\\ncoii.mitteo who bad charge of this measure not\\ndesirable that tbe fees should be diminished, as\\nthat would hardly meet tho difficulties of the\\ncase, but cons\\'dered it would bo preferable\\nto abolish all compulsory payment of fees whether the inar\\niicgo were celebrated by banna or license, and that persons\\ncon ing lo the celebration of the mnrnago rito should merely\\nmake wbat voluntary offerings they choto upon the occa\\ntun. Ho believed that would be a wiso courso AB we\\nn ode no charge for baptism and other rites of tho Church,\\nhe thought people should receiv e this nie without being\\ncompelled to pay for it It would remove difiiculties out of\\nthe way, and would draw numbers to tho Church to be\\nmarried if all the fee6 they were required to pay before tho\\ncelebration of tho marriage were abolished Of course ho\\nWOB aware that certain expenses were paid by means of these\\nfeet-that out of them a certain provision was made for the\\nsalaries of tho registrar of the diocese, and the Bishop\\'s\\nfceretary , and ho wae well aware that some other provision\\nwould bave to be made, it the Synod should resolve to carry\\nout this resolution It appeared to the committee that there\\nwould bo other ways and means found for providing for\\nmeso minga , ont that was a question he should be able te\\nmoot at a later stage of the proceedings. He hardly ex-\\npected that there would be much objection to the report, end\\ntherefore ho did not like to occupy tho time of the committee\\nby dilating upon it any longer Whatever the decision of\\ntho question might be, he should receive it with good temper\\nand Christian feeling\\nThe Rev Canon ALLWOOD seconded tho motion.\\nThe Rev ALriiED STEI HEV, though entirely approving\\nof the abolition ti all marriage fees, felt it right to move an\\namendment, which was, that ali the words after the word\\n\\' licence,\" m the second line, bo omitted, with a view of\\ninserting the following words, \"except a fee of \\xc2\\xb11, be\\nabolished \" He believed that it would be inexpedient,\\nhowever desirable, to abolish the fees altogether. Tho\\nparish would be taxed to pay the salaries of the registrar\\nand tbo Bishop\\'s secretary, and even at present there was\\nEome trouble in gotting the Synod expenses The payment\\nof \\xc2\\xbf1 es a marriage fee would not be felt aa irksome, while\\nit would provide the money requisito for the s\\xc3\\xa1lanos he\\nhad mentioned\\nThe \\xc2\\xa1Rev R.

      " 'PEAK DOWNS COPPER MINE. I\\nI , ? - .1-T., - ? Il\\nI \" TO \\xc3\\x8fHE ETJ1TOK OP TH*\" HElUUD^ ^ \\xc2\\xa1 |\\nSir,-Just now\\'when so much\\'depend\\xc3\\xad upon bona fido\\nmining investment\\xc2\\xab it would bo well to examine tho recent\\nreport of so prominent a company as the Peak Downs,which\\nhas caused such a consternation in -tho minds of the invest-\\ning public. After tho progress of the mino had culminated\\nin to splendid a success as that shown last half-year when\\nthe whole of the nominal capital was returned, we had a\\nright to expect that the affairs of tho company were based\\nupon n really solid footing-a footing too \\xc2\\xabure to bo upset\\nby the causes set forth in the last report. A comparison\\nbetween this and the previous report forces upon one the\\nconviction that neither the one nor the other represented tho\\nfair Btato of the company\\'s position ; that if not both, cer-\\ntainly the last was written to havo tho effeet which it cer-\\ntainly had. There is no doubt about the effect of tho report\\nm July last, and I observe, in passing, that with this com-\\npany the effect of the half-yearly report invariably pre-\\ncedes with singular accuracy its actuol issuo. The com-\\npany\\'s etock was raised to tho highest point it has yet\\ntouched, while tho prcEcnt report tends to send it down to\\no figure far below tho real value of tho shares. Every line,\\nevciy word tends to depreciate the company\\'s position.\\nBut let us take the points seriatim. ,\\n1. In July wo were told of the arrival of the\\nfirst shipment of Corni\\xc3\\x9fh miners and of another\\nihipnieut \"hourly expected,\" and that \"this acces-\\nsion of labour w ould allow tho mining operations to bo\\npursued on a larger scale, the furnaces to bo constantly\\nsupplied with n proper ossoitmcnt of oro, and the quantity\\nof me at grass to be much increased.\" What has bocomo of\\nthiB other shipment ? Did the men over arrive, or did thoy\\ngo to the bottom ? And if they arrived, how comes it that\\nthe production of oro is Icsb than it was P How is it that\\nno mention of them is now made, but that wo aro only told\\nof a botch of miners to soil in Fobruary, and who cannot\\npoEsibly nrrivo in time to affect the production of the mino\\nduring the now current six months t\\n2. Wo wero told last half-year what tho actual produc-\\ntion of the mino was, viz., 1449 tonB of refined copper.\\nWhereas now there is no information whatever vouchsafed\\nto ns, wo aro only told vaguely of thedecroosoof production\\ncaused by a temporary want of fuel ; and wo know this,\\nthat tliis \"decreased production,\" whatever it may hove\\nbeen, has cost \\xc2\\xa365,377, whilo lost half-year 1440 tons\\' of\\nrefined copper cost only \\xc2\\xa360,671 ; that the smaller mun thus\\nexpended gave a return at the rate of 200 per cent, per\\nannum, and the larger expenditure gives nil.\\n3. In July, when the object was to pay a big dividend,\\nevery item which could swell tho company\\'s profits was\\nset down. Storesand materials were valued; the stock at\\nthe mino, the office furniture, and the petty cash found\\ntheir ploco in the balance sheet. Whero aro they\\nnow ?

      " 'A CASE OF SUTTEE.\\n(From the Pioneer, May 4.)\\nTHE following are the circumstances of the suttee case\\nwhich occurred in the Cuwnpore district : -\\n. On the 16th ultimo the brother of a woman named\\nMuBsumat Rahusia, living at a village six miles ironx\\nthe police station of Sheolee in the Cawnpore district,\\nbrought her tidings that her husband, a Brahman\\xc2\\xbb\\nOmeid Tewarree, had lately died at Mhow. The\\nwidow showed great emotion ; she broke the bangles\\nfrom her wrists, and shortly after began to crj|\\n\" Stitt Ham, Stitt Pam,\" repeatedly at short inter-\\nvals, announcing her intention to sacrifice herself.\\nThe Pundit of the family advised the test to be\\napplied, vi-/.., that her hand should be placed over a\\nlighted lamp, to see if she could bear the pain. The\\nlamp was brought, the -widow herself placed lier handt\\nover the flame, and kept it there until it waa black\\xc2\\xbb\\nened and blistered, declaring that she felt no pain ;\\nBhe was then declared worthy to perform the sacrifice.\\nA large number of the neighbours assembled, and\\nthere appears to have been a good deal of apprehen\\nsion among them at this time as to the consequences\\nwhich would ensue if the suttee should toke place.\\nThe members of the woman\\'s family declared that\\nthey would not allow it, as it was the \" Angrezi\\namul,\" and the results might be serious to them.\\nThe matter was left undecided that clay, though the\\nwidow herself never seems to have faltered in her de\\xc2\\xab\\ntermination. The next morning some of the family\\nstarted with the widow for Bithoor, for the purpose\\nof performing funeral rites for the deceased husband\\xc2\\xbb\\nbut the Pundit recalled them, Baying that the day wass\\ninauspicious. The widow continued throughout the\\nday to chaunt \"Stitt Pam, I will go and burn with\\nmy husband.\" Many people came to see her.\\nTowards evening she addressed some Thokoor zemin-\\ndars, and begged them to grant her the bson of a\\npiece of land for the sacrifice, At last one of the\\nThakoors present appeared to be overcome by h I\\nsolicitation, and said, \" Come, I\\'ll give you a fisld,\\nbe the consequences what they may,\" notwithstanding;\\nthe protest of many present who prophesied the\\ndanger of the proceedings. After this, however, less\\nopposition was offered, and large numbers of peop\\'e\\ncome to make their obeisance to the holy woman. It\\nappears to have been understood this evening that the\\nsuttee would take place. Early the next morning \\xc2\\xab\\ncircumstance occurred showing the feeling of the\\npeople. A man obtained admittance at down to the\\nhouse, and falling down before the womnn, addrcsserl\\nher, saying, \" Maharanee, I am moonblind, when,\\nshall I regain my sight ?\" evidently having faith in\\nthe miraculous powers with which the intended sacri-\\nfice was supposed to endow the vie im. The woman,\\nhowever, who had eaten nothing for two days, and\\ndrunk nothing but some Ganges water, appeared\\nmuch exhausted on this morning, and after begging\\nthe people of the house to hurry on the preparations\\nlay down for some time gasping on her back. Hoc\\nfriends thought she was dying and the Pundit ad-\\nvised a gnrment fangurkhee) of her husband\\'s to be\\ngiven to her, saying that her soul was longing for her\\nhusband, and perchance the Bight of his co.it would\\nrevive her. The angurkhe\\xc2\\xbb was brought by her son,\\nand it really seemed to pioduce the desired c-ilect, foe\\nclasping it to her breast she rose and called for the\\nmusicians, and again addressed the zemindars presento\\nasking for a piece of ground for the performance oE\\nthe suttee. The Pundit here improved the occasion to\\naddress a sermon to his female parishioners :-\" Few\\nwives now-a-days,\" he said, \" love their husbands\\nlo well as this woman loves her huBband\\'saHjiirMfe.\",\\nThe Thakoor who had come forward the previous\\nevening again declared his readiness to give a field,\\nand hurried out to give orders for wood to be cut and\\ncarried to the spot. Several men gave their assistance\\nin cutting and carrying wood, and as Boon as a pyre\\nwas constructed, information was carried to the\\nwidow, who, after putting on jewels and otherwise\\npreparing herself, lost no lime in proceeding at almost\\na running pace to the field, followed by a procession\\nof some two or three hundred of the neighbouring\\nvillagers-the males first, and the women in the rear,\\nsucceeded by a band of village musicians pressed into\\nthe service. On arriving at the field, the suttee, as\\nthe woman is now called, mounted the pyre, on which\\nshe set herself cross-legged, and gave instructions\\nthat her son should set fire to it. This son, a youth of\\nabout eighteen years of age, had brought a \\'nundle of\\ngrass with which to set light to the wood, and as soon,\\nas his mother was prepared he fired the gross. On\\nthe flames rising the suttee half rose from her sitting\\nposture, on seeing which the spectatoas murmured in\\ndissatisfaction, but the woman immediately resumed\\nher seat, and signed with her hand that she had no\\nintention of evading the sacrifice. Shortly after some\\nof the bystanders threwTin more wood, the flames\\nrose and surrounded the victim, and the sacrifice waa\\nconsummated. The spectators then brought flowers\\nand offerings of various kinds, threw them on the em-\\nbers, and dispersed.\\nNow it must be remembered that this suttee was\\nfirst agitated on the loth, and that it was not consum-\\nmated till the 17 th, and that during this time hun-\\ndreds of people were thinking and talking of little\\nelse. Yet the police, it really appears, did not hear\\nof it until a chowkeeelar started from the guilty village\\nfor the police station of Sheolee on the 17 th at anhouc\\ncarefully calculated to make this information too\\nlate. When the chief constable, Azeezoolah, reached\\nthe scene of the tragedy about 1 o\\'clock, he found\\nnobody, and nothing but ashes. When he pushed\\nhis inquiries, he was told that the woman had herself\\ncollected wood and gruss without assistance, aid had\\nsecretly, without accomplice, burnt herself to death.\\nThe native police elicited no other information,\\nand they did < not communicate even this.\\nThe District Superintendent, Mr. Goad, saw\\nthis chief constable, Azeezoolah, on the fol-\\nlowing day, the 18th, and talked at length with\\nhim regarding other offences in the district; but the\\nchief constable made no mention of the sulcce. It waa\\nnot indeed until the 20th that the Azee/.ooloh sent\\nhis diary, containing the false account which the vil-\\nlagers had in the first instance attempted to palm off\\nupon him, by post to his superiors.

Now though ho\\n(Mr. Mort) granted that this carno from an interested\\nhourre, trom a dock, company anxious to get vessels into\\ntheir docks, and so secure the chargea upon thoso vessels, it\\nwaa not the less pertinent as regarded our interests. \"Wo did\\nnot care BO long as we got t\\xc3\\xado charges upon our wool\\nreduced. A gentleman, largely connected with the wool\\ntrade in this colony, had handed him a statement of the\\nconsolidated charges upon wool at tho warehouses. The\\nrent for threo months upon an ordinary bale was 5s., and\\nthe prices increased as tho weight inoreased up to 8s. per\\nbale. Then thero were extra charges for damages, and\\' so\\nforth, but this was about the average thing. At the prices\\nquoted hero ho was satisfied that not only were we at a dis-\\nadvantage in tho exhibition of our wools, which was an im-\\nportant point, for the distances at whioh tho ware-\\nhouses were, and the woy in which tho wool was\\ni-rammed into inconveniont places, injured our sales,\\nbut we paid through tho nose most enormously. If we\\ni-ould only adopt a system whereby these colonies could\\nbecome their own warehouso-koepors, wo should save our\\npocket 8 very largely indeed. He moved with somo little\\nhesitation in a measure with which ho was not acquainted\\n. by personal observation, but he might state that the dif-\\nferent parlies with whom he had conversed, and who had\\nteen theto things, had given him positive assurances that\\nnothing could be worse than the syetom now adopted. He\\nhad enid when ho started that tho object of this mooting was\\nlather one of inquiry than declaration. Ho did not state\\npositiv: ely that these evils existed ; but he said that matters\\n.bould bo inquired into, that tho time had, arrived when\\nthese colonies should BOO whother they would not\\nlo benefited by having their own separate warehouses.\\nThere was another point of view from which this mattor\\nwas to bo considered. Our wool was coming into contact\\nwitti nil other descriptions of wool. Ho was under tho im-\\npression that if you wont into bad company you wore sus-\\npected of hi ing bad yourself ; and if our wool wore placed\\nwith Cupe and other low-priced wools, thoir inferiority was\\nreflected upon our own wool, and tondod to lower its price.\\nHe -WOB quite satisfied a sufiiciout caso was made out if not\\nfor declaration, at least for inquiry. Ho know thero were\\ngentlemen in England, and in tho colonies too, who dis-\\ncouraged this movement ; that there woro gontlemen hore\\nwho would endeavour to shew that it waa not dosirablo to\\nliisturb this system, but that tho question should be re-\\nferred te the existing committeo in London who regulated\\nthese Eales. Ho did not wish to say a word\\nngaihfvt these gentlemen. Ho had no doubt thoy\\ndid the\\'r duty conscientioUBly ; but we wanted to get\\npeople who wero themselves largely interested in wool-\\nton ing, und not merely in wool selling. Ho was largely\\ninterested in woolgrovving himself, and ho thought the\\nI lai get t possible advontago would result from this meeting,\\nif it were unanimous in sending homo an expression of ita\\nwithes. Tho resolutions were modoBtly worded, woro not\\n\\' offensive in any senso or form, and would elicit an auswor\\nto the effect either that things should remain as they wore,\\nor that it was time to look out and make other arrange-\\nments. At present thero was a general feeling of discon-\\ntent among the wholo community, and it was desirablo to\\nset that feeling at rest, inj\\'ustico both to the community\\nof England and ourselves. The resolution did not\\nattack the present system of sales, although it was\\nfound that the brokers charged muoh. too high.\\nThey wcro said to charge both the huyors and sellers, and\\ncertainly their charge of half per cent, did look very bad\\nindeed. It was just possiblo that we might be, to uso a\\ncolonial phrase, \"barking-up the wrong troo\" now, but\\nwhatever came of this meeting could ouly bo for good if\\nthey wei e unanimous in their resolutions. If theso charges\\nvveio right no alteration would be sought for; ifthi\\'y wero\\nwrong wo should have theui altered at once. Ho was\\nstrongly of opinion that our interests ought to ba entrusted\\nlo the class of persons who hud to pay the piper, and ho\\nhoped tliis point would be boroo in mind whoa tho raao\\nlutious were put to tho meoting. Ho was largely interested\\nin steck in Ibis colony ho WBB corry to Buy, and ho was\\n1\\'ioking aft\\xc2\\xab his interest by attending this meeting; and\\nhe t-liould i n happy if the\\'little trouble ho had taken in\\nthis matta- should lead to n good result.

The ancient Greeks\\ncalled hooping-cough the \"wild or untamable\\ncough,\" a name which, for anything medical science\\nhoB done, may be given to it at the prisent hour. It\\nwould be ns vam to ask the profession what hooping\\ncough ii, as to inquire philosophically \" What l8\\nheat ?\" Tho duty of the medical profession ia to euro\\nthe patient, but not to prevent disease arising , hence\\nit need not be expected that any but a few minds will\\never bo directed to search and find out tho cause of\\ndicebse, what particular diBenses re illy are, and how\\nthey might be prevented\\nAs a non-profesMontl, I have been led to make\\nthese remai ks from obberung closely some cases\\nof the above-mentioned disease which have come\\nunder my notice. I shall give the whole particulars,\\nin the hope that other non-professionals will observe\\nfor themstlveB whatever diseases may happen to come\\nwithin their notice. During avery wet day two boys\\nwere returning from school, one at them put on three\\npairs of trousers, and the other put on a thinner pair\\nthan usual-each in this acting nccording to hia own\\njudgment Before reaching a railway station both\\ngot wet, and had to Bit in their wet clothes till nearlv\\nhome. The boy of the three pairs of trousers showed\\nsymptoms of a bad but ordinary cold next day , the\\nother was none the worse for his ducking. Tho hrst\\nboy had a hatsh cough for about a week, during\\nwhich time mustard applications to the chest wore\\nused ; his feet were bathed in hot water and mustard\\nevery night prior to his going to bed ; ipecacuanha\\nand other expectorants were admimstere I The\\ncough continued, nnd increased in violence On the\\nbLventh or eighth day the other boy begun to cough,\\nand another and younger boy-all of them slept in\\nthe tame room-began ubont the same time. On\\nthe eleventh or twelfth day, a child six months\\'\\nold, m the same family, began to cough. It was\\ntherefore evidently a contagious disease, lhis was\\nmore clearly proved by adult persons in the sime\\nfamily becoming slightly affected in the throat and\\nchest.

These arc questions intended merely\\nto suggest inquiry. I feel certain, however, that\\nby inoculation this disease would soon be as\\nlittle known as small-pox In the successful \\xc3\\xaenooula\\ntion of cattle for pleuro-pneumonia, we moy easily\\nsee that inoculation ior the hooping cough would\\naa\\\\e the life of muny an infant, lor it is to infants\\nthat the hooping-cough pro\\\\es chiefly fatal. Fur\\nanything that is known, the pleuro-pneumonia dis-\\nease of cattle may be similar to the hooping cough m\\nthebumantubject, and the hooping-cough might provo\\nas fatal to the higher as pleuro-pneumonia is to the\\nUm cr clafB of animals, were it not for the more easily\\nexcitable spasmodic action in the case of the human\\nsubject. Having some knowledge of pleuro-pneu\\nmouia, from observation and experience, I have been\\nstruck with the remarkable similarity the expectorated\\nmatter in hooping-cough bears to that found in and\\naround the respiratory organs of cattle which h.i\\\\e\\ndied from pleuro-pneumonia.\\nBituTAL TouTunn ov ,v Ciutn BY HIS FATHER -At\\nLambeth Police Office, on tho 3rd of March, William\\nFry, a jobbing carpenter, who had been taken on a\\nwarrant, was placed at the bar before Mr. Elliott on a\\ncharge of torturing a child. Mr. Clifford, the re.\\nlieving cflicer of Camberwell parish said, that on\\nFiidby afternoon last a poor little boy ef eleven ycai\\xc2\\xab\\nof age, very thinly elad for such a time of year, and in\\nastute ot greatexhaustion, was brought to him to the\\nworkhouBe, and on examining him he was quite\\nshocked at finding an iron manacle weighing upward\"\\nof two pounds, made fast to his instep. It consisted\\nof a thick iron belt, Becured at both ends with a strong\\nbolt and screws, and attached to this bolt was passed\\nthe end of an S hook, of sufficient strength to control\\nan elephant. On questioning the boy he said that f >r\\nat least ten months he had been compelled to wear\\nthis formidable shackle, and that it was by the\\nmerest accident he was enabled to get at u\\nchopper, by which he had managed to release hi-n\\nself from the blcck to which it had been made fait,\\nand then escaped from the houee of his father. So\\nBGCure was the manacle he (Mr. Clifford) had at-\\ntempted to describe, and which he produced for his\\nworship\\'s inspection, that he had to go to a black-\\nsmith\\'s Bhop to get it off ; and after it was removed,\\nand the poor boy attempted to wulk without it, he\\ncould scarcely do BO. lie bent backward and for-\\nward several times before he could move from the\\nBmith\\'s anvil. On examining that part of the right\\nleg round which the iron belt had been placed, he\\nfound it much wasted, and apparently bent, and\\nvery different from the left leg. His whole frame\\nalso appeared emaciated, so much so that it was per-\\nfectly apparent the pour little fellow had been\\ngiOBBly neglected, and had not had sufficient food ;\\nand in proof of this, on placing him in the scale he\\nonly weighed 36 lbs. The psor little fellow\\nseemed in the greatest terror of being taken\\nback to his father, and, crying piteously,\\nbegged of him (Mr. Clifford) not to do so. On\\nFiiday night the prisoner called on him, and he then\\ntold him he must attend before a magistrate at this\\ncourt to answer the charge of assaulting his son. The\\nprisoner, however, said he should not attend unless\\ncompelled, and he (Mr. Clifford), in consequence,\\napplied for and obtained a warrant for his apprehen-\\nsion. Mr. Clifford here placed on the table in front of\\nthe bench the manacle spoken of, and the block to\\nwhich it had been attached, the latter being found\\nin the washhouse from which the poor child had\\nmade his escape, and both weighing nearly twelve\\npounds. The exhibition of these extraordinary and\\nformidable implements of torture applied to a mere\\nchild, created a perfect feeling of astonishment and\\ndiEgust. John Purdy stated that on Friday afternoon\\nUBI he was at work in a nursery ground adjoining\\nWoodbine Cottage, the residence of the prisoner,\\nand Baw the little boy come through the hedge\\nwith the irons attached to hiB left leg. He told him\\nhe had just released himself from a block, and he\\n(witneBBj took him to the next police station. Mr.\\nRogers, a retired mariner, residing next door to the\\nprisoner, Baid that for the last niue or ten months he\\nhad frequently seen the boy in the yard of his father\\'s\\nhouse dragging the log produced about, and carrying\\npBils of water into the house. He was generally\\nlightly elad, and did not appear near the size now\\nthat he did twelve months ago. Harriet Coggins,\\nwho also lives next door to the prisoner, deposed to\\nthe same facts, and added that she had frequently\\nseen prisoner\\'s children locked up in the wash-house,\\nand had on many occasions given them food, as\\nthey complained of not having had enough to eat.\\nEdward Mark Fry, a poor emaciated little fellow,\\nwho was clothed in the workhouse dress, was here\\nexamined by Mr. Elliott respecting the nature of\\nan oath, and having answered with much intelli\\ngt ne\\'e, he was sworn, and said he was eleven years\\nold, and that his father\\'s family consisted of a sister\\nolder than bimBelf, a brother younger, and a step-\\nmother. He had been to Behool, but it was so long\\n\\xc2\\xbbince that he forgot the time. Towards the latter end\\nof the winter before last it was that his father first put\\nthe irons on his leg, and made them fast to the block,\\nand the irons remained on from that time until Friday\\nlast, when he by chance got hold of a chopper and\\nchopped away until the staple came out, and ho mode\\nhis etcape. Mr. Elliott : What was the cause of the\\nirons being put on ? Witness : Because my little\\nbrother and myself spent a halfpenny I found under\\nthe grate in the buck parlour. Mr. Elliott : I suppose\\nthe irons hutt your leg very much ? Witness : Yes,\\nsir, it did at first very much, but not so much when I\\ngot used to it; it used to hurt me much to drag the\\nlog after me. Mr. Elliott : What was done at night ;\\nWOB the log tnken off? Witness: At first\\nI used to sleep on an old coat and\\ntrousers in tho washhouse, and at that time\\nfather used to take the log and make the iron fast by\\na lock to a staple in the floor, close to the place whore\\nI lay. In the morning he unlocked it again, and\\nInste ned \\xc2\\xbbn iron to the block again ; but for the lost\\nele-ten months I think it haB not been off a\\', all. I\\nhad to carry it up stairs cverv night, and down in the\\nmorning. Mr. Elliott-What ! and always sleep\\nwith it on ? Witness-Ye\\xc2\\xab, sir, it was always on.\\nThis question and answer produced a perfect burst of\\nindignation from all parts of the court. The witness\\nhere repeated the manner of his escape, and said a\\ngentleman had just taken him to the station-house,\\nand he was sent from there to the workhouse.\\nIn answer to further questions, ? the poor child\\nsaid that neither himself nor his little brother\\nwas allowed to toko meals with his father and\\nmother, in.law-, but his sister was sometimes. They\\nwere locked in the wash-house, and were allowed a\\nsmall quantity of meat on Sundays, but on other days\\nthey hod nothing but dry bread and a few potatoes,\\nbut not enough. Policeman 81P said he apprehended\\ni he prisoner on the day beforo on a warrant, and on\\ntelling him the natuie of the charge, he replied,\\n\" Here\\'s a pretty mc66 I\\'m in for merely correcting o\\nboy. Had I let him run about the streets he would\\nhave been in a reformatory.\" He also said that there\\nwere two others as bad as thiB boy was, and that he\\ncould not keep his tools from them. The prisoner, in\\nreply to the charge, said that before ho began to\\n\" correct \" the boy, he waa connected with a gang of\\nthieves who infested the neighbourhood \\xc2\\xa1 bul this the\\nboy denied. Mr. Elliott observed that he could not\\ntruBt himself to speak of the conduct of the prisoner\\nas he felt, and should therefore send him beforo\\nanother tribunal to be punished as his serious offence\\ndeserved.

He claimed \\xc2\\xa3160 damages. Mr.\\nPigott appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. S. C. Brown for\\ntho defendant. The agreemont undor which the plaintiff\\nserved tho Council provided that the engagement\\nmight be terminated by cithor party on a\\nmonth\\'s notice. Mr. Brown objected that tho\\nnew Municipalities Act conferred oxprosaly upon the\\nmayor of any borough power to diBmiss any of tho servants\\nof tho borough, and that it was not competent for the\\nCourt to review the mayor\\'s dotormination in that respect.\\nHis Honor was ef opinion, on the provision cited, that tho\\npower of suspension was delegated to tho Mayor, and that\\nthe power to dismiss rested with tho Council. He hold\\nthat it was competent for him to review tho dismissal by\\ntho Council. Tho evidence showed that tho plaintiff was\\nsuspended on the 9th of Juno, and that tho sus-\\npension was confirmed by tho Council al its next\\nmeeting, held shortly afterwards. Plaintiff\\'s testimony\\nshewed that tho mayor of tho borough (Mr. Taylor) told\\nhim that ho only suspended him because ho was askod_ to\\ndo so ; Taylor admitted that ho had no fault to find with\\nhim, and spoke highly of his efficiency, Messrs. Penfold\\nand Peate, aldermen of tho borough, gave evidence to the\\neffect that tho plaintiff had at all tunes performed tho duties\\nof his office in tho most efficient and satisfactory manner ;\\nwhile, on tho other hand, Aldermen Humphrey and Stone\\nstates that tho plaintiff had inaccurately kopt the minutes,\\nwithheld certain vouchers, whereby tho borough lost tho\\nGovernment endowment for tho half-year-that he had\\ndiEobcyed orders, and had been disrespectful to tho Mayor,\\nin practically calling him a liar on the occasion of a public\\nmeeting, and again at a meeting of tho Council. Theso\\nallegations were contradicted by the plaintiff. Tho minutes\\nof Council contained no record of the cause of plaintiff\\'s\\ndismissal, and tho only evidence on this point was in tho\\nvorbal report of the mayor, who thon stated\\nthat he had suspended the plaintiff because his\\nconduct was distasteful to a majority of tho\\naldermen, and because he bad no confidence in him.\\nMr, Taylor (the mayor of tho borough) sworo that ho did\\nsot dismiss Davis in consequence of any ill feeling, but\\nsimply becauso on ono or two occasions Mr. Davis had\\nasserted that he (witness) was a liar, and that Davis had on\\nmore than one occasion altered things in the account-books\\nin opposition to his (tho mayor\\'s) instructions. Ho was of\\nopinion that Davis was out of his mind at times. [At this\\nBtagc of tho caBc, his Honor intimated ho was of opinion\\nthat plaintiff had been wrongfully dismissed ; that\\nif there had not been any ill-feeling in exist-\\nence, plaintiff would never havo been dismissed.]\\nMr. Brown \\xc2\\xabintended that tho mayor of a municipality\\nhad the power to suspend a clerk or servant, at any time,\\nwho in his opinion was guilty of misconduct; such suspen-\\nsion, of courso, would bo subject to csnfirmation by tho\\nCouncil. In this instance, tho Council had confirmed tho\\nsuspension, that Davis had no right, boing a servant of tho\\nCouncil, to have attended any public meeting of tho rate-\\npayers, and; that Davis, having charged the mayor with\\ntelling falsehoods was quito sufficient cause for his dismis-\\nsion. Tho utmost that could bo claimed by tho\\nplaintiff was,\" a month\\'s pay. Mr. Pigott con-\\ntended that plaintiff was entitled to a year\\'s\\nsalary, tho contract having been for that period.\\nHis Honor was of opinion that he had jurisdiction to\\nconsider the question whether tho plaintiff hod been\\nwrongfully dismissed. He did not think that it was evor\\nthe intention of the Legislature that the Council clerk\\nshould be entirely at the meicy of tho Council, and should\\nbe deprived of all resort to a Court of law. As a matter i\\nof fact, he was of opinion that tho defendant had been\\nwrongfully dismissed by the Council. He was disposed to\\nthink that the plaintiff had shown a spirit of |\\npar\\'ialify, and had been guilty of conduct\\nwhich was unbecoming, and which would havo\\njustified the defendant in giving him a month\\'s\\nnotice ; but he did not think that that impropriety of con- j\\nduct was sufficient to justify his summary and absoluto\\ndismissal. He was of opinion upon the ovidenoe that tho\\nplaintiff had not been dismissed for misconduct, but becauso\\nhe did not givo satisfaction to a majority of the aldermen.\\nThe contract was for a year\\xc2\\xbf and that contract had not\\nbeen determined by the notice in writing required to be\\ngiven under it.

      " 'MILL\\'S DISSERTATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS.\\n{From the London Review.)\\nONE of the most remarkable facts which the\\nhistorian of the future must take into account\\nin estimating the forces that have governed\\nprogress in our age and country is, in spite of\\nMr Buckle, the individual influence of a great\\nman. At whatever department of thought we\\nglance, we distinguish, by comparison with the\\nconditions of twenty years ago, the unmis-\\ntakable stamp of one mind. Within the period\\nnamed, the experiential school of philosophy,\\nwhich had almost disappeared from the country\\nof Locke, driven out by a crude deluge of\\nGerman transcendentalism, has been raised\\nalmost to scientific perfection, has been formu-\\nlated, criticised, cleared of obscurities. In-\\nductive logic, since Bacon\\'s time practically\\nregnant in England, has vindicated as well a just\\nphilosophical supremacy The great problems\\nof social and intellectual freedom have been\\nboldly shaped into a grand code of tolerance, to\\nwhich even bigots are now compelled to yield\\nat least a lip worship Among our public men\\nand writers a broader view of responsibilities,\\nclass pretensions, and national claims has begun\\nto prevail Both in theoretical and practical\\npolitics the narrow selfishness, which aped\\nUtilitarianism but was really its antithesis, has\\nbeen to some extent discarded and now, if we\\nhave not quite escaped the taint of party bitter\\nness in political discussion,we have at all events\\nthe gratification of seeing that the number is\\never increasing of thinkers and even statesmen,\\nwho set philosophy above intrigue and petty\\nprivate interests On the whole we are\\njustified in the boast - though we see\\nmore promise as yet than performance\\nthat this generation is less the slave of\\nprejudices and formulas, more earnest, more\\nthoughtful, more logical than that which imme-\\ndiately preceded it It would be difficult to\\nover-estimate the share in this distinct and\\nwelcome advance which is due to the personal\\ninfluence of Mr John Stuart Mill.\\nMr Mill\\'s earlier appearances as an

and\\nrevolutionary, we shall find in Mr Mill\\'s system\\nthe most admirable type of modern develop\\nment Where the political economy of others\\nis hard anti narrow, his takes a broader view,\\nand docs not arrogate an irrational dominion\\nover the higher instincts of human nature\\nThus we find that ulonc, after Adam Smith, Mr\\nMill has put Ins favourite science into i form\\nnot repulsive to those bene\\'olent aspirations\\nwhich no science can extinguish in man In\\nthe same way he has softened down the harsher\\ntraits of the utilitarian philosophy, as it derived\\nitself from Bentham In politics, the tin\\nRadicalism of his fathtr, James Mill, and his\\nschool, has been vivified and informed with i\\nnew soul by that noble chapter in the \" Political\\nEconomy \\' on \\' \\'1 he Probable Futurity of tne\\nLabouring Classes, \\' by the \" Essay on Liberty,\\nand the \\' Representative Government\" And\\nthose students ol mental philosophy who wotilel\\nhave rejected the gross materialism of Hartley\\nand Condillac can recognise in the refutation\\nof Hamilton a metaphysical theory which\\nneither revolts the logical sense nor the\\nspiritual nature It is this apt combination of\\nthe strictest principles of individualism with a\\ngenerous enthusiasm for everything that is just\\nand noble, which has gained for Mr Mill his\\nwide and potent sway over the mind of\\nEngland Resting as that sway does, on the\\nfree allegiance of the mest enlightened and the\\nmost ardent spirits among the younger genera\\ntion of Englishmen, it must, beyond question,\\nbe extended and strengthened with mere lapse\\nof time How far this philosophy can be con\\nsidered an ultimate growth admits of more\\ndoubt It ein only be supplanted, however, ii\\nat all, by a system based on the solidarity of\\nmankind, and on theories which only a few\\nthinkers in this country regard as other than\\nhopeless unattainable dreams\\nAlmost cvtiy page of ihe volume befoie us\\nfurnishes us with in example of Mr Mills\\npower over opinion To him is due the grow-\\ning interest felt by the public in Mr. Hare\\'s\\nscheme of personal representation, and the\\nglowing toleration accoided to its discussion\\n\\'lins plan is very cekariy the very apothcosis of\\nindividuihsm in the domain of practical politics,\\nand, as such, will never meet with the approval\\nof those who regard rather the action of the\\npopular will through masses than the divlsion of\\nthe State into little groups of personal interests\\nIt is so very improbable that we can go so far in\\nthe wat of recasting our institutions as to adopt\\nMi Hare\\'s ingenious machinery, that the ques\\ntion is practically taken out of the sphere of\\nuseful debate, since we believe even Mr Mill\\nhimself, in bringing it under the nonce of the\\nHouse of Commons, rather desires to assert\\nthe principle than hopes to establish the\\nactual change A more real benefit, in our\\npresent effort to complete some satisfactory\\nrepresentative Reform, may be derived from\\nMr Mill\\'s sensible statement of the advantages\\nof grouping, in a redistribution of seats Wh lt\\never ma) be the fate of the fianeluse clauses of\\nthe present Government Bill, no one believes\\nthat Mr Disraeli\\'s redistribution plan has an)\\nchance ol fav omable acceptation In this\\npoint, however, the scheme of last year was\\nvery little better, and was open to all the ob\\njections which Mr Mill ably urges against\\nLord John Russell\\'s Bill of 1852 in view of\\nsome probable modifications of the grouping\\nsystem being proposed by one or other party,\\nthe following remarks on the radical vice of\\nprevious propositions will be found interest-\\ning -\\n\" \"i et, if the principle of combining several boroughs\\nwas once admitted, what course could be more obii\\nt>ovb than to taut all the present boroughs, and nil\\nunrepresented towns of more than a certain amount of\\npopulation (bay, for example, oOOO), and leaving out\\nall those, w hellier existing as boroughs or still tobo\\ncreated, avhose importance entitles them to one mem-\\nber, or more than one, of their own, to arrange the\\nothers in groups according to geographical conveni-\\nence, care being taken lo give to each group something\\nlike the same number ol electors No reason is appa-\\nrent tilly this plan was not adopted, except the mis-\\nplaced scruple against merging two existing boroughs\\ninto one if what is now i borough is to beeomo\\none ol a group, what difference can it make to the elec-\\ntors whether thev ure bound up with existing, or only\\nwith newly enfranchised re electors 5 What couldbe\\nmore abnurd than lhat dine anil ( hippeiitiam both\\nnommant n boroughs, and

representatives might\\noctiisioiiftllj be made on public rather than on pnv ite\\ngrounds\\n\\'Hie papers in this volume, which onginally\\nappeared in I ra^r s Mm/iutur, were so widely\\nrend in

IN MIND,\\nwhen disease undermines the health, and the physical\\nsystem has become prostrated, a stimulant that will not only\\nstrengthen, but remove the c*use, should be immediately resorted\\nto. Mental distress is also a fruitful source of the break\\'ing down\\nof the constitution, and the ravages of this enemy to health are\\ntruly alarming. For all such maladies,\\nHOSTETTER\\'S STOMACH BITTERS\\nhave been found unsurpassed. By acting directly upon the\\ndigestive organs, they remove the heavy, disagreeable fcelinj\\natter eating, so often complained of by persons of a delicate tem-\\nperament. As soon as digestion is restored, the patient finds hil\\nstrength increasing, and his general health improved.\\nThousands of persons certify that it may be relied on in all\\ncases of weakness or nervous debility attendant upon sedentary\\nhabits. The generality of Bitters are so disagreeablo to the taste\\nthat they are objectionable to a weak stomach. This is not the\\ncase with Hostetter\\'s Bitters, whioh will be found mild, and\\nextremely pleasant. Balsamic barks, plants, and roots contribute\\ntheir restorative juices to render it soothing and strenc-thening.\\nIts basis is the only pure stimulant which has over been produced,\\ncontaining no fusil oil, or any other deleterious element. The\\nmost careful and skilful chemists have analysed the bitters, and\\npronounce them harmless. This is scientific testimony ; hut the\\ntestimony of the hundreds of thousands who have experienced the\\npreventive and curative effects of the GREAT VEGETABLE\\nTONIC and ALTERATIVE of modern times is still moro con-\\nclusive. In Fever and Ague. Dyspepsia, Billiousness, Nervous\\nComplaints, Chronic Complaints, and general debility, it Is as\\nnearly infallible as anything in this fallible world can be.\\nWholesale Agents, ELLIOTT, BROTHERS,\\nHO and 112, Pitt-street, Sydney.\\nHOLLOWAY\\'S OINTMENT. - Be Comforted\\nNothing is more distressing to the mother or well-disposed\\nnurse than to see a child rendered feverish and restless by the\\nskin affections attending infancy.

      " 'THE LATE GUNPOWDER EXPLOSION.\\nINQUEST ON THE BODY OF GEORGE GAMBLE.\\n[FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.]\\nAn inquest was held before Mr Brown, coroner for the dis-\\ntrict, at the Weatherboard Inn, \"Western Road on the 17th\\ninstant, upon the body of George Gamble, nineteen years\\nof age, who was killed on Thursday evening, while driving\\na dray loaded with blasting powder, which exploded.\\nWilliam McManamey, on oath, deposed: I am a senior\\nconstable of police, stationed at Pulpit Hill, Bathurst dis-\\ntrict , about 8 o\\'clock last evening, I was informed at the\\nstation that there had been an explosion of two tons of\\nblasting powder, that was being conveyed on a dray owned\\nby James Melville, and driven by deceased, the powder\\nwas the property of Mr. W. W. Watkins, railway con-\\ntractor; I proceeded to Spring-hill, five miles from the\\npolice station; I there saw the body of deceased, it was\\nforty feet from where the dray was when the powder\\nblew up, the body was quite naked, the skin\\nbeing scorched off all over, it was lying on its\\nstomach, the hands stretched forward, some of the\\nbowels were twisted round the fence that encloses\\nthe railway cuttings, I found the left foot of deceased was\\nabout four yards from the body and through the fence; it\\nappeared as if it had been torn off by striking against the\\nfence; there were marks on the post of the fence as if the\\nbody had struck against it; on examining the body I ob-\\nserved that the head was nearly torn from the trunk, it\\nwas only held on by a small piece of skin on ths lsft side of\\nthe neck, the right side of the head, face, and neck had\\na black, burnt appearance, tha skin and hair of the head\\nwere torn off for several inches, the right ear was wholly\\ngone, the eyes were black and scorched , the jaws and face\\nwere smashed, the arms broken, the right hip was very\\nblack and torn inwards for a depth of from two to three\\ninches, and for a circle of six inches the flesh was gone. It\\nappeared as if the right side of deceased was nearest the\\nfire, the right leg below tbe knee was broken , the axle of\\nthe dray lay on the side of the road, ten feet from\\nwhere the dray was at the time of the explosion, one tire\\nof wheel is some considerable distance further off, there\\nis no other trace of a dray left, one of the horses was lying\\non his near side about five yards away , the entrails\\nwere strewn over the road, the heart laying some distance\\nfrom the body, another horse appeared as if he bad been\\nforced along the road with great velocity, his back was\\nbroken near the shoulders, and entrails forced out; a\\nthird horse was found about thirty yards away, and had\\nbeen lifted from the road over the railway\\ncutting and fence enclosing it, he was quite blind; a\\nfourth horse had the off hind leg tom away, was scorched, and\\nblind, since dead , a fifth had the hoof torn off the hind leg,\\nblind, since dead, the sixth is very much scorched and\\nnearly blind , the harness is all destroyed; the banks at the\\nside of the road were much torn up , the telegraph wire was\\nblown off half a dozen of the posts, three panels of fencing\\nwere broken, and posts and rails split about 40 feet off.\\nJohn Keegan deposed I have a contract with Mr.\\nWatkins for the cartage of blasting powder from the railway\\nstation, Penrith, to No. 4 section Great Western Railway\\nextension, I1 helped to load deceased\\'s dray on Monday\\nlast, I objected to take the powdor in its then unfit state\\nfor transit, numbers of the casks being loose, and the\\npowder escaping from them, Mr. Francis, and Mr. Watkins,\\nclerk of works, said if I did not take the powder some one\\nelse would, and that my security (\\xc2\\xa3100) would pay for a\\ngood deal of the carriage; I, to save my security,\\nloaded deceased\\'s dray, and two others driven by\\nmy self, I felt the risk my drivers incurred\\nso much that I begged Mr Watkins not to\\nallow the powder to be sent, he did not interfere, as the\\nteams proceeded along the road theo powder was dropping\\nout, when riding up from Pennth this morning there\\nwere traces of the powder all the way along, and on several\\noccasion when my horse trod on it the loose powder ex-\\nploded, sending flame up to the horses girth.\\nMichael Redden deposed; I am a carrier, and was about\\nseven yards ahead of deceased at the time of the explosion,\\nhad been travelling with him for two or three miles, de-\\nceased was, when I first saw him a few minutes before the\\noccurrence, walking at the side of the dray, he was sober;\\nI saw powder along the road, it had dropped from the dray\\nin front of me, driven by Pat Keegan, after the discharge\\nI found one of deceased\\'s shaft horses had been driven\\nunder my dray between the wheels, I had some difficulty\\nm gotting the horse extricated from its position, no part\\nof deceased\\'s dray or loading was visible after the explo-\\nsion, I saw deceased\\'s body after it was found.\\nJohn Redden deposed; I was about fifty yards behind\\ndeceased\\'s dray, when the powder took fire a turn of the\\nroad intercepted my view, mv horses turned round on the\\nroad and knocked me down, when I recovered no dray or\\nloading was to be seen, deceased was sober, and did not\\nsmoke, I saw the body of deceased after it was found,\\npowder was strewn along the road from the drays that pre-\\nceded me; I helped my brother to get the horse from under\\nhis team.\\nPatrick Keegan deposed; I loaded at the same time with\\ndeceased, I heard my father (J. Keegan) refuse to\\ntake the powder in the drays, which he after-\\nwards did at the instigation of Mr. Francis, the\\ncasks were quite unfit to be moved , half on each load were\\nloose, hoops broken, and heads not tight, from the start\\nthe powder was strewing on the road, they said to them-\\nselves often that they would be blown up , my father fol-\\nlowed as far as the top of Lapstone Hill, to caution us to\\nuse every care for this time, and he would throw up the\\ncontract before he would expose us to such risk again;\\nwhen the explosion took place he was about thirty yards\\nahead, I was standing on the shaft of my wag-\\non, I was thrown off , as I was descending I\\nwas struck near theo eye with the telegraph wire, that was\\njust at same instant blown off the posts; I did not perceive\\nthat it was deceased\\'s load that exploded at first, I thought\\nit was my own , I started to run away, but seeing my load\\nuntouched, I proceeded to where deceased\\'s dray had been;\\nI saw deceased\\'s body found, he did not drink any intoxi-\\ncating liquor, or smoke, after we started from the Plains.\\nThe jury found a verdict of \"Accidentally killed, by ex-\\nplosion of gunpowder,\" adding the following rider, viz :-\\n\\'The parties in charge of the powder belonging to Mr.\\nWatkins, at Emu Plains, have not used proper precaution,\\nby not seeing that the casks were in a fit state to convey\\npowder.\"'\n",
      " 'NEWS OF THE DAY.\\n.\\nUva oable messages of this morning supply in a\\nbrief form the opinions of several of the leading\\nEnglish journals on the Victorian Constitution ques-\\ntion. Epitomised as these opinions necessarily are in\\nour telegrams, they are sufficiently comprehensive to\\n.how that Mr. Berry\\'s policy is regarded with\\nmuch disfavour in England. The increase of\\nthe German army is not alone obnoxious to\\nthe Russians, but the German peasantry have\\nbeen memorialising the Chief Marshal of the\\nGerman Empire for a reduction, instead of an increase\\nof the army. Count Moltke told the people that such\\n\\xc2\\xbb step was impossible now, and would only be possible\\nWhen European nations, acting under religious and\\nmoral influences, recognised war as a national\\ncalamity. The death of the Parliamentary representa-\\ntive for Liverpool has created a vacancy, the filling of\\nwhich is to be regarded as a test of the public feeling of\\nEngland with regard to the Beaconsfield regime. A\\nTory and a Literal have been nominated. The advo-\\ncates of home rule for Ireland are supporting the\\nLiberal candidate, but the Liberal party seems to be\\n\\xc2\\xbbputting up.

The rirst item\\nis a tolegram from the Chief Secretary of Vic-\\ntoria to the Colonial Secretary of New South\\nWales, as follows :-\" January 6,1880. Southampton,\\nand Suez contract being abandoned by the Imperial\\nGovernment, this Government purpose tosend all mails\\nafter January via Brindisi and charge present\\nSouthampton rates on letters, packets, and newspapers ;\\ndivision of postage between Imperial and Colonial\\nGovernments to bo matter of future arrangement.\\nFor the present, other colonies to account to Victoria\\nsame rates as now. Your concurrence invited in\\ntransmission of mails by fortnightly service via\\nBrindisi in accordance with foregoing. Favour of early\\nreply requested.\" In reply to this the fol-\\nlowing telegram was sent by the Govern-\\nment here to tho Government of Victoria :\\n\" January 9.-If we are to continue to pay your pre-\\nsent charges on correspondence both ways, and the\\namount retained by England on correspondence com-\\ning this way, besides Continental transit rates, we can-\\nnot consent to reduce our present rates from here on\\ncorrespondence via Brindisi.\" The Postmaster-General\\nin Melbourne then addressed our Postmaster-General\\nin the following terms :-\" 14th January, 1880.-In\\nreply to your telegram of 9th instant, I would beg to\\npoint out that the proposed reduction in postage rate\\non correspondence sent via Brindisi under new fort-\\nnightly contract will be no special advantage to Vic-\\ntoria. The public of each colony adopting the\\nreduced rate will derive the benefit The ques-\\ntion of transit rates to be accounted for to Vio\\ntoria by other oolonies can be better considsred when\\nsufficient data are obtained upon which to base an\\nequitable arrangement, as it is not the object of this\\nGovernment to make a profit out of the contract at the\\nexpense of the other colonies. You are probably aware\\nthat Italian transit rates have been reduced. South-\\nampton route having been abandoned, it is believed\\nthat Imperial Government is prepared to reconsider ar-\\nrangements as to division of postage.\" Mr. Samuel\\nse_t a telegram in reply on the following day as\\nunder :-\" Re your telegram of yesterday, we can only\\ndeal with the present position of matters. If we reduce\\nto 6d. and hare to pay you that amount on all letters\\nboth wave and have to pay England 2d. on inward\\nletters besides Continental rates, we shall sustain .\\nfurther loss on ocean mail services ; and, as we are not\\nprepared to do this, cannot consent to any reduction of\\nBrindisi rates.\" Then in consequence of a paragraph\\ni which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald\\nour Government, on the 20th instant, dispatched\\nI tho following cablegram to Sir Daniel Cooper, the\\nacting Agent-General of this colony:-\" Last Septem-\\nber Imperial Government notified proposed abandon-\\nment Southampton route and reduotion Brindisi postage\\nto sevenpence. We replied,-No objection, provided\\npenny would meet Continental rates. Victoria has\\nsince proposed reducing to sixpence, to which we have\\nobjected. Now rumoured Imperial Government favour-\\nably considering Victorian proposal. Strongly protest\\nagainst any reduction that will prevent our receiving\\nthe fourpenco already agreed to be allowed on every\\nhalf-ounce letter.\" I\\nAt a\\'meoting, yesterday, of the Commissionappointed\\nto conduct the representation of New South Wales at\\nthe Victorian International Exhibition, it was decided\\nto telegraph to Melbourne, asking for the allotment of\\n20,000 feet of space for New South Wales exhibitors.\\nIt was stated during discussion that \\xc2\\xa310,000 would\\nprobably be required to secure the fitting representation\\nof New South Wales at the Exhibition to be held in\\ntho sister colony this year. j\\nSeveral deputations waited upon members of the\\nGovernment yesterday, the majority of the interview\\xc2\\xbb\\nbeing with the Minister for Works. Representatives\\nfrom the southern suburbs waited upon that gentleman\\nto protest against the proposed soheme of drainage by\\nway of Shea\\'s Creek, on the ground that it would be\\nan intolerable nuisance to the people living in those\\nsuburbs, and dangerous to health. Mr. Lackey pointed\\nout that the official reports he had received were\\nI opposed to the views put forward by the deputation,\\nbut the representations the deputation had made\\nshould receive the most thorough investigation.\\nIn reply to a deputation who advocated the connection\\nof the Great Northern Bailway with Sydney at some\\npoint near Newcastle, Mr. Lackey said that no time\\nwas being lost in making arrangements for connecting\\nthe Northern line with the Southern and Western line.\\nIt was premature now to say where the junction would\\ntake place, but he did not think the Government could\\nignore the trade of the Lower Hunter when deciding\\nupon the point of junotion. Another deputation that\\nwaited upon the Minister for Works urged upon\\nthe Government the necessity for extending\\nthe Great Western Ballway from Orange towards\\nWilcannia, or some part of the Darling. Mr.\\nLackey said that nothing could be done in the matter\\nuntil the surveys were completed. When they were\\nready there would be very little delay in extending the\\nGreat Western Bailway. A deputation representing\\nthe fire insurance companies waited upon Sir Henry\\nParkes, to ask if he would re-introduce to Parliament\\nthe Firo Brigade Bill, which provided for the appoint-\\nment of a general superintendent of brigades, and other \\'\\nchanges that were much required. Sir Henry Parkes\\nsaid he was disposed to undertake what the deputation\\nrequired; but the measures already laid before Par-\\nliament by the Government must have consideration\\nbefore any other.\\' The subjects of the other deputations\\nhad reference to the necessity of weighbridges at\\nrailway stations, the removal of an encroachment on\\nDriver\\'s Boad, Burwood, and a wharf at Greenwich\\nPoint.\\nEarly yesterday morning misty rain began to fall,\\nand by noon a steady drizzle set in, and continued with\\nbut little intermission all afternoon and night. After\\nthe warm dry weather we have had of late, this\\nchange to rain and a cooler atmosphere has been very\\nacceptable, especially to those lucky enough to possess\\ngardens.\\nThe Mayor of Sydney, Mr. P. A. Jennings, and\\nMr. J. Davies, M.L.A., yesterday waited upon Pro-\\nfessor Reuleaux, the German Commissioner, as a depu-\\ntation from a preliminary meeting, for the purpose of\\nasking that gentleman to attend a complimentary ban-\\nquet which it was proposed to tender him prior to his\\ndeparture for Europe next nwnth. Professor Beuleaux\\nthanked the deputation, but stated that he would ac-\\ncept it as a favour if the whole of the foreign commis-\\nsioners were invited to attend the banquet. This\\nrequest will be aoted upon, and an influential com-\\nmittee is being formed to make the necessary arrange-\\nments.\\nMr. M\\'Dougall (of the firm of Sands and M\\'Dougall),\\nMr. John Sands, Mr. Hugh George, Mr. Franks\\n(of the firm of F. T. Wimble and Co.), Mr. Dunlop\\n(of the firm of Dunlop and Edwards), and other\\ngentlemen interested in typographical pursuits, visited\\nthe Government Printing Office yesterday, at the\\ninvitation of Mr. Thomas Richards, to witness the\\noperations of a printing machine made by Messrs.\\nDryden and Ford. Mr. Richards selected the\\nmachine on the occasion of his visit to London in\\n1877, and also endeavoured to ascertain the most econo-\\nmical purposes to which it could be applied. At that time\\nhe saw 32 demy-octavo pages printed at one impression,\\nbut having great confidence in the capabilities of the\\nmachine, he determined, if possible, to Increase the\\nnumber. The chases were rearranged and improved\\nhere by Messrs. D\\'Arrietta and Potter, and the result\\nhas been that the machine as it was worked here\\nprinted sixty-four pages at a time. Mr. M\\'Dougall,\\nwho has a knowledge of all the modern improvements\\nin the art of printing as it is pursued in London, ex-\\npressed his satisfaction at the working of the machine,\\nand several other gentlemen present said they thought\\nit indicated a marked advance in economical printing.\\nThe impressions were pronounced to be excellent and\\nthe register good. The Government Printer has four\\nof the machines at his command now, and could, if\\nrequired, print with them in one day 1000 copies of\\na book of 500 pages.\\nAt the annual meeting of the Parramatta Hospital\\nheld last night, the Bev.

The report\\nof the committee, for the past year, was laid before the\\nmeeting. It set forth that the building was in good\\ncondition, that means for easier exit in the event of\\nfire had been constructed, in the arrangement of which\\nthe thanks of the committee were due to Mr. J,\\nM\\'Donald for tho valuable assistance he had rendered.\\nA new floor had been laid incurring considerable out-\\nlay towards the meeting of which the sums received\\nfrom the Skating Club had proved useful. The\\nfinancial position was very satisfactory, and the income\\nwas economically employed. A regret was expressed\\nat the limited number of subscribers, and a suggestion\\npnt forward to the effect that a person should be en-\\ngaged to enlist subscribers, to whom a life membership\\nmight be offered, or membership at the rate of 12s. a\\nyear. A referenoe was made to the successful scientific\\nentertainments lately given in the hall by Mr. W.\\nMao Donnell, and \\xc2\\xbbhope of their continuance held out,\\nprovided sufficient encouragement were given.

A carrier had just delivered a dray\\nload of goods on board one of the vessels lying opposite\\nTslbofs wool stores, when his horse suddenly com-\\nmenced to back ; and before the driver could reach tho\\nreins, horse and dray went over the wharf into tho\\nwater, turning a somersault in their descent. Several\\npersons assisted to rescue the animal, but only suc-\\nceeded in getting him olear of the cart. Some men in\\na berat then towed the horse to the steps at the bottom\\nof Phillip-street, and attempted to get him out of the\\nwater there > but in doing so the winkers carno off, and\\nhe returned to the water and swam about for nearly\\nhalf an hour. At length a South Sea Islander got into\\nthe boat, which again proceeded in the direction of the\\nhorse. As soon as it got closo enough, the darkie\\nsprang on to the horse\\'s back, fastened a rope round his\\nneck, and by this means tho animal was towed to the\\nwharf and eventually got on shore. Numbers of\\nsimilar accidents have taken place at or near tho same\\n?pot through the unprotected state of the Quay ; and\\nthe matter of taking some steps to protect their recur-\\nrence is worthy of consideration.\\nA cobbispo\\xc3\\xaetdekt writes to the Perth Inquirer :\\n\" A West Australian from Sydney states that he and a\\nfriend were three hours looking for the W.

It was arranged\\nthat a number of them should be sent up from the\\nsummit of the Observatory Mount in the Dandenong\\nBanges, and that observations should be made at tho\\nMelbourne Observatory. Mr. Walter Draper, of\\nElizabeth-street, at whose instance the experiments\\nwere made, conducted the display at the mountains,\\nand most careful and patient observations were made\\nat the observatory, under the direction of Mr. B. L. J.\\nEllery, Government Astronomer, by whom the altitudes\\nattained by the rockets and the results of the successive\\nexperiments were noted. Able assistance was rendered\\nto him by gentlemen connected with the torpedo\\ncorps. The experiments extended over an hour, and\\nduring that period rockets of from half-a-pound to six\\npounds, and of various colours, were sent up. A largo\\nproportion of the rockets could be seen by the naked\\neye, but the colours could rarely be distinguished\\nwithout the use of the theodolite and suitable glasses.\\nThere wero occasionally long intermissions in the dis-\\nplay, which conveyed the impression that somo of the\\nrockets could not be seen. The night was tolerably\\nfavourable but for a little haziness in the atmosphere\\nat times. The experiments showed that the largest\\nrockets can be seen at a distance of at least 20 miles\\nfrom the spot at which they are discharged, but that\\ntheir colours become dim and mixed beyond that dis-\\ntance.

The unfortunate man, who had only recently\\ngiven up the occupation of cook at an hotel in Lis-\\nmore, died in a few hours. At an inquiry subsequently\\nheld, the engineer of the a. s. Queensland, who was then\\nin Lismore, gave it as his opinion that the boiler was\\nnot well constructed; but, as the fireman did not\\ntake the precaution of blowing through the\\ngauges to see that they were unobstructed,\\nit would be hard to say whether the boiler\\nwas too full or otherwise; consequently the cause of the\\naccident could only be surmised.

Tho defendants had\\npleaded-first, a general doninl that thej- had dono any\\ninjury to tho plaintiff ; secondly, that whatever injury had\\nbeen inflicted lind been the unavoid.iblo result of what thoy\\nhad done in the lawful conduct of their businoss as coal\\nlumera.\\nSir William Manning, Q.C., Mr. Darloy, and Mr. Salo-\\nmons, instructed by Mr. Maguire, appeared for the plaintiff;\\nand Mr.,Butlor, instructed by Messrs. Allen, Bowden, and\\nAllen, for the defendants.\\nTho plaintiff was the lessee of Spring G rovo, a farm of\\nfifty acres, at Fairy Meadow, Wollongong district,\\nin the vicinity pf the Mount Pleasant Colliery. His\\ncase was that a small stream of water which ran through\\nhis and other lands in that neighbourhood had been ren-\\ndered unfit for uso bj- tho deposit of n largo quantity of\\nslocOc coal from the collierj\\' in question, ana that his farm\\nhad boen otherwise injured from the samo cause. Tho\\ndefendants\\' caso was that there had been no such injury,\\nand that although the creek might have boon partially fillod\\nup by slack coal, this had not been the result of any care\\nlossnoss on tho part of tho emploj-ccs at the colliery, but of\\nn land slip, the result of a flood, for which tho defendants\\nwere not responsible. The evidenco was very voluminous,\\nand in\\'many respects very conflicting. Tho amount really\\nin question was a small one, but tho object of tho contest\\nwas rather, it would appear, to determine tho genorol ques-\\ntion whether or not tho proprietors of cool mines in that\\ndistrict were to be held responsible for damages of this cha-\\nracter. According to the plaintiff and his witnesses the\\ncreek had clearly been damaged by the presence of a\\nquantity of slack coal which hod como down from an\\nimmense henp noar the mouth of the mine-a result bl ought\\nabout by the carelessness of the minors in allowing bo vast\\nan accumulation at such a place. Tho supply of water from\\nthis creek had previously been regular ana abundant. Tho\\nwater, although a littlo hard for washing purposes, hail\\nbeen excellent for every other kind of domestic use, but\\nsince the conl had come down it had been quito useloss.\\nTho waterholes had boen completely filled up, so that the\\nconstancy of tho supplj- of water was to it great extent put\\nan end to, and such as was still to bo had was very bad.\\nThe flood, too, bad carried tho slack coal over some of tho\\ncultivated land, and hod destroj-cd or damaged tho crops.\\nCook had about forty head of cattle which had boen accus-\\ntomed to drink at this stream, but which could\\nnow scarcely use ii. He had boon compelled\\ntherefore to sink a well. Ho had offered to toke \\xc2\\xa320\\nin full compensation for these injuries, and for this sum to\\nclear out the bed of tho creek himself, but tho defendants\\nhad refused lo give him that amount and had offered only\\n\\xc2\\xa310. According to tho defendant\\xc2\\xab\\' wltnosses the water of\\nthis creek, which had always been a littlo brackish,.had\\nbeen in no way injured by tie influx of slack coal, which\\nwas far less than had been represented, and was occasioned\\nsolely by a landslip during a flood which hod brought down\\nat the samo time a largo quantity of soil. The spread of\\nslack coal over tho land to a small extent had rather a\\ntendency to increaso its productiveness than otherwise, and\\ntho catUo had in no way suffered. The^offer of \\xc2\\xa310 had\\nbeen tendered, it was sworn, without prejudico-that is to\\nsay without admitting any liability-and only in tho hope\\nby dealing liberally with tho plaintiff to save all trouble and\\nexpense. Samples of tho water from . this\\ncreek were exhibited in Court, whioh sample\\xc2\\xab\\npresented a very uninviting appearance. It was contended\\ntint they had not been fairly token, but that the water must\\nhavo been btorcd up, but this was denied. Some of this water\\nwas analysed by Mr. Watt, from whose evidence it would\\nappear that its\" foulness aid not in all probability result\\nfrom tho presence of coal, but from that of organic matter.\\nIt further appeared that watcrcrcsscs wore growing plen-\\ntifully in the creek, and that decomposed vegetable matter\\nmight in dry weather help to make the water bad. Tho\\nwater of the creek, according to Mr. Watt, was naturally\\nbrackish, and tho slack coal from this\\'mino when settled\\n(as it. would, settle) ,at. tho bottom of theiBtreain when\\n\\' \\'net flowing rapidly- would\\'\\xc2\\xab not pollute it as alleged.\\nThere was nirtfccr evidence that a stream of water coming\\n.ut of the same seam of coal was quite pure, and was con-\\nstantly used for domestic purposes. Seme of the coal was\\nbroken up in Court and placed in tumblers ef water, upon\\nwhich it left a slight scum, although without otherwiso\\nrendering the water apparently impure. The impurity, J\\nhowever, va\\xc2\\xab most positively \\xc2\\xabvom to by the plaintiff\\'\\xc2\\xab *\\n**\"?\"-~-i _.\\n.witnosBcs. Somo evidence was gone into on the part of tho\\nI ?\\'_.nti(T lo show that tho lond-slip, if it did canso tho dam-\\nage (which was denied), lind been the result of some mis-\\nmanagement of tho excavation. This was mot by direct\\ncontradiction on tho(pnrt of tho defendants. Tho ovidenco\\nwas directly contradictory na to the quantity of slack coal\\nin tbo heap nenr the colliery, and in nearly ovcry other im-\\nportant particular, even \\xc2\\xa1is to tho local features of tho\\ngi omul.\\nHis IIokoh directed the jury that the plain ques-\\ntion for their deteniiiuation was whothor or not tho\\nplaintiff hnd mndo ont any claim to damages for\\ninjurj\" sustained by him through any want oi duo core on\\ntho p\\'nrt of tho defendants\\' employes. Evory man had a\\nright to work n coal mine, but ho was bound so to monago\\nit as that his neighbours should not bo injured. Against\\nlend slips nud floods no amount of caro could guarel ; but\\ntho miners wero bound to exctciso duo caro and forethought\\nso ns when buch accidents took placo their neighbours\\nmight bo \\xc2\\xabs little injured as possiblo by any escapo from tho\\nminc.\\nThe jury, without leaving tho box, found a verdict for the\\ndefi\\'iidnnts.'\n",

As the rain continued, however,-the captains\\no ; the respective teams agreed not to resume play until\\nMonday, and a general rush was made for the trams and\\nomnibuses, which returned to town uncomfortably crowded.\\nThe Play.\\nMurdoch and A. Bannerman resumed their innings a fow\\nminutes after 12 o\\'clock, to the bowling of Evans and Mid-\\nwinter. Tho first four overs wero maidens, and Murdoch\\nthen drove Midwinter to tho on for a sinclo, but tho last\\nball shot quickly, and took Banneruian\\'s wicket. (2-21-60.)\\nM\\'Donnell followed, but in Midwinter\\'s next over ho\\nattempted a drive, and was splendidly caught by the\\nbowler, who secured tlio ball with ono hand. (3-0-60.)\\nSlight succeeded him, and Murdoch hit Evans to tho terrace-.\\nfence for 4. Slight then drove Midwinter for a single, but\\nin trying to tit a \"yorkcr\"from Evans he had his bails\\ntrimmed. (4-1-65.) * Groube now joined Murdoch,_ and\\nscored a single off each bowler. Murdoch then snicked\\nMidwinter to the southern fence for 4, which brought 70\\nnp. Three to Groube and two singles to Murdock resulted\\nfrom the next S overs, and then Murdoch getting a chance\\nat Evans, drove him grandly aloutr tho carpet for 4. (SO\\nnp.) Seven successive maidens followed, the bowlers being\\ntoo well on to be trifled with, and Murdoch then\\nput a ball from Evans to mid-on for a single. Edwards,\\nwho had Fhortly before relieved Midwinter, bowled a maiden\\nto Murdoch, and Groube, after cutting Evans for 2, was\\nsmartly caught in the same over by Gregcvy in the slips.\\n(5-7-S3.) Blackham followed, and opened off Edwards\\nwith a good oil drive for 3 : and cut Evans for a single.\\nMidwinter hero went on again in place of Edwards, and\\n\\' Blackham hit the third ball of the over for two. Murdoch\\nnegotiated an over from Evans without scoring, and Black-\\nham after getting a singlo off Midwinter, made a fine off\\ndrive for 4 in Evans\\' next. The score was increased to 95,\\n. when another change in the bowling was deemed advisable\\nCoopev taking the ball from Midwinter. Blackham imme-\\ndiately hit the first ball to tho terrace fence for 4 ; put the\\nthird to log for a couple, and Murdoch out the last for 2.,\\n. The \"century\" had now been passed, and Blackham, by a\\nfine hit to the grand stand fence, added another 4 ; Mur-\\ndoch now faced Cooper, and got a lucky snick off the first\\nball for 4, finishing -the over with a hit to the off\\n:for n single. (110 up.) Threejmaiden overa followed, and\\nBlackham then hit Cooper twice for a brace each. A double\\nchange was now tried, Garrett going on instead of Evans,\\nand Gregory relieving Cooper. The batsmen, however, kept\\ntheir wickets up until the luncheon hour, the score standing at\\n123. Upon resuming, the number of runs was increased in\\nthree overs to 135, when Evans went on in place of Garrett.\\nTho change proved a judicious one, as Evans in his first\\nover broke through Murdoch\\'s defence. (6-65-135.) The\\nAustralian captain played a fine innings all through, and\\nwas applauded from all parts of the ground as he retired\\nto the pavilion. Jarvis succeeded him, and Garrett took\\nthe ball from Gregory at the southern end. Two maidens\\nwere bowled, and Blackham scored a single off Garrett,\\nJarvis snicking the third ball to the fence. (140 up.)\\nScoring now became very slow, only 3 runs resulting from\\nfive overs. M\\'Shane then went ou instead of Garrett, and\\n?in his third over bowled Blackham, who had played a fine\\nvigorous innings for 36. (7-36-143.) Boyle, who was\\napparently lame, succeeded him, but was beautifully caught\\nin the same over by Elliott. (S-0-143.) Palmor came\\nnext, but after scoring a single was also well caught behind\\nthe wicket by Elliott off Evans. (9-1-146.) Alexander\\nwas last man,\" and he and Jarvis brought tho score up to\\n155, when the South Australian, after a useful innings for\\n11, was clean bowled by Evans. Alexander carried his bat\\nout for 6, and the inning\\'s closed for 155.\\nAbout half-past 3 o\\'clock Massie and C. Bannerman went\\nto the wickets once more, on behalf of the combined team,\\nto the bowling of Spofforth and Boyle. Massie immedi-\\nately commenced operations by driving \" the Demon \" for a\\nsingle. Pie then cut Boyleto the pnvilion fence for 4, and\\nin Spoffortli\\'s next over, Bannerman hit the\\nfirst ball to the grand stand fence for 4, and\\ngot tho next past the wicket-keeper for a single\\n\\' This biought 10 up, and Massie added another single for a\\ndrive in the same over. A single to Massie, off Boyle, was\\nthe next item, and tho same batsman hit Spofforth towards\\nthe pavilion fenco for 3. Notwithstanding the bad light\\nthe batsmen continued to score rapidly until 30 runs had\\nboen put together, when Boyle managed to get a ball past\\nBannerman. (1-11-30.1 Horan now joined Massie, and\\nsoon afterwards .Massie made a high hit towards\\ntho southern fence off Boyle, giving a chance to\\nSlight, who dropped the ball. Palmer now relieved\\nSpofforth. Two maidens wero then bowled, and in\\nPalmer\\'s second over Mnssio hit him twice for 4, and\\nfinished the over with a hit for a single. Ho then faced\\nBoyle, hit the second ball to long-on for 2 ; snicked the\\nnext past fhe wicket-keeper for a similar figure, and drove\\nthe last ball for a sincle. This brought 60 up, and an over\\nor two later Massie was nearly run out. The escape,\\nhowever, made little difference, as he was bowled by\\nAlexander, who had relieved Boyle. (2-50-60.) The\\nretiring batsman was loudly applauded on his way to tho\\npavilion foi- his innings, which was marked by\\ndashing and at times lucky play. Evans joined\\nHoran just as 1he rain commenced to fall, and the latter\\nbatsmau hit Palmer to long-leg for 4. Evans then drove\\nAloxauder foi- a single, and negotiated the next over from\\nPalmer without scoring. The rain now carno down\\nsteadily, compelling the players to return to the pavilion,\\nand, after waiting for some time, it was decided that play\\nKhoulel bo resumed on Monday, at noon.

      " 'NEW ZEALAND.\\nNOTES ON PASSING EVENTS.\\n[KItOM OUU OVWX COWIES I-ONDKNT.)\\nAUOKT.AXJ), 20th January.\\nTin; news from lho East Coast is hy no means\\nso good Ihis last week. At Opotiki, there is a\\nreturn of a stale of filings which is very far from\\npleasant in the recommencement of hostilities\\nby (he natives in the line of murdering any\\nEuropean or loyal native they can catch. All\\nalong they were of course ripe for this, if the\\nopportunity had been considered favourable, and\\nthe fact that for a considerable time nothing of\\nthe sort was tried went to show that they were\\ndeterred by fear from the course. They have,\\nit appears, entered upon it again, and this, more\\nthan anything of more decided want of success\\nto our troops or loss to our men, is the real bad-\\nness of the news.\\nThe Auckland papers are a little too much\\naffected hy it, I think, and seem to lay stress\\nupon it as if it involved the loss of prestige, and\\nthe undoing of work supposed to be done\\nalready; but \\'there is no good ground for sup-\\nposing that any change at all affecting the\\nultimate position of the campaign has taken\\nplace.\\nColonel Lyon, who commands at Opotiki,\\nhas, I believe, already taken measures to\\nrepress the forward movement of the rebels,\\nand a short time will, 1 have no doubt, see\\nthem driven back once more to their fastnesses\\nwhere they were to have been attacked some\\nweeks ago-a course which, if taken, would, no\\ndoubt, have put a stop to the present evils.\\nAlthough a good many ambushes have been\\nset by the rebels, we only know of one victim\\nhaving been secured-a Maori of the native\\ncontingent, named Johnson, who was toma-\\nhawked and brutally hacked to pieces. There\\nare more than suspicions entertained regarding\\nthe position of many of the natives professedly ,\\nfriendly in the district. No doubt, many arc\\ntraitors, but that is not so remarkable as the\\nreadiness with which we seem always to trust\\nthese people again.\\nLower down the coast the last stronghold of\\none section of the natives seems to have fallen\\nto our attack with but trifling loss ; and we may\\nnow consider that, with the exception of the\\nforce at Opotiki, which is a conglomerate of a\\ngood many sections of rebels,-there is now no\\nfear of a formidable resistance being offered to\\nour aims on the East Coast. Of course, it is true\\nthat these people arc very easily moved from\\nplace to place, and a little vigour displayed at\\nOpotiki rntiy soon cause the re-appearance of\\n\\xc3\\xadcbcls at Turanga-mii or at Waiapu. This, in\\nfact, is a main difficulty of our position, and one\\nnot easy to provide against but by constant care\\nand watchfulness.\\nOn the \"West Coast, at \"Wanganui, it is grati-\\nfying to find that something vigorous is at last\\nbeing done. The operations of General Chute\\nhave not been characterised by any startling\\ndisplay of military science or of original genius,\\nbut they have been vigorous and well-timed,\\nand as such have produced better effects than\\nmany more correctly planned operations would\\nhove done.\\nThe loss of another field officer in Colonel\\nHassard, of the 57th, is a great pity, as the\\nofficers hare been very heavy sufferers already\\nin comparison with the men in this war. How-\\never, the moral effect on the natives of finding\\nIle soldiers able to storm pas off-hand and\\nfollow them boldly into the bush will be excel-\\nlent indeed. To the colonist, too, it is no small\\ngratification to find that the troops are to have\\ntile chance before they go to remove the re-\\nproach which was made against them of being\\nafiaid of the bush and of native forts. It is no\\npleasant position for people of British race at\\nany time to hear sims cast upon the good name\\nof the British aimy, of which they arc proud\\nalmost by instinct. A little beating will be\\nenough for the AVaneanui natives, for they arc\\na chicken-hearted race, too cruel to be really\\nbrave, and so esteemed even by their own\\npeople.\\n1 hope General Chute may see their submis-\\nsion complete before the troops are all with-\\ndrawn from the colony.\\nIn my account of my experiences of the\\nnorthern part of this island (which is the result\\nof a careful personal inquiry into the facts), your\\nreaders will have learned most of the local facts\\nof interest al present.\\nThe discovery of a fine vein* of copper at the\\nlower Thames, in the neighbourhood of the\\nplace where gold has been found in payable\\nquantities, but inaccessible, owing to native\\njealousy, is a fact of some importance.\\nCopper has been known to exist for some\\ntime in the neighbourhood, and the\\nproprietor (native) of the land is quite willing\\nto have it worked. It is said that there is a\\ngood deal of the silver with the copper, which\\nwill of course enhance the importance of the\\ndiscovery, if correct.\\nI am informed that a cominmy, with a capital\\nof \\xc2\\xa320,000, is in course of formation to work\\nthe New Zealand flax on the plan discovered by\\nMr. Purchas, some of which was in the Sydney\\nmaiket previous to the Avar, and commanded\\nexcellent prices. The present effort promises\\nwell, as some of the best names in Auckland are\\nconcerned.\\nAUCKLAND, 2\\'Jlh January.\\nTo-day is the twenty-seventh Anniversary of\\nthe founding of this colony, and all Auckland is\\nholiday-making in consequence. The weather\\nseems not to have proved particularly favour\\ni able to the regatta, which is our way of holding\\nhigh festival here on this occasion each year,\\nI and the absence of the old Maori element to a\\ngreat extent from the scene lakes much from\\nthe romance of the affair. Formerly\\nit was the Maori festival j.ar excellence,\\nbut for the last two years the natives\\nhave not been on sufficiently cordial terms,\\nexcepting to the North-and the Northern\\nnatives never did much in canoe-racing-to come\\nin any considerable numbers to the regatta.\\nWere the Northern tribes removed or unfriendly\\nwe should soon be much in the position of the\\nAustralian cities, where an aboriginal native is a\\ncomparatively rare sight.\\nThe position of matters on the West Coast is\\nveiy greatly improved by the operations \"of the\\ntroops under General Chute. In a former\\nletter I gave some details of his earlier\\noperations in taking the pas at Manu\\ntaki and Manapawa, where Colonel Has\\nsard, of the 57th, was unfortunately mor-\\ntally] wounded. These successful operations\\nwere, however, only preliminary to his larger\\nscheme, which he has now, in great measure,\\naccomplished. That was to penetrate from\\nWanganui to Taranaki by an inland route, and\\nto take all the fortifications, and destroy all the\\nhouses and plantations he could find on the\\nway. Starting with about 750 men in all, of\\nwhom about 500 were her Majesty\\'s troops,\\nand 250 colonial forces, either natives or Forest\\nBangers, he forced his way through serious\\ndifficulties of all sorts, the chief of which was.\\nthe want of food, which was moro than once\\nvery seriously felt, to the extent of obliging the\\ntroops to eat horse-flesh, as tho commissariat\\nJ\\xc2\\xbb\\nfe \"*- -*\\ncould.not keep up with them. On the march\\nabout ten days seem to have been consumed\\'\\nand it is stated that in the various fights that\\noccurred on the route not less than 150 natives\\nwere killed. Every fortified place was assaulted\\nand taken by storm, on the principle established\\nby the colonial forces on the East Coast, and in\\nall cases the defenders of the pas seem to have\\nbeen panic struck at the apparition of soldiers\\nactually rushing a pa before a single shot had\\nbeen fired at it from the traditional great guns.\\nGeneral Chute had reached New Plymouth at\\nour latest dates, and had been received with the\\ngreatest possible enthusiasm, which displayed\\nitself in the form ol triumphal arches and ad-\\ndresses.\\nThe General\\'s work, however, is not yet done\\nby any means. This march indeed is but the\\nfirst blow, which must be followed up with\\nothers in rapid succession, unless it is to be\\nforgotten. He is quite aware of this happily,\\nand is about to recommence his march back\\nagain, only taking the coast line instead of the\\ninland route.\\nAt Warca, near the Patia Uiver, and on the\\nwonderfully fertile plateau that stretche3 away\\nsouthwards from the base of Mount Egmont,\\nthere is reason to believe that the natives will\\nbe found in very considerable force, and with\\nformidable works of defence. The country is\\ndifficult, owing to the heavy scrub of manuka\\nand flax which occupies most of the district\\nand the natives are so fully competent to take\\'\\nadvantage of this that it may safely be said\\nthat the heaviest part of the work is yet to\\ncome.\\nA continuance of the same fearless tactics\\nwill, however, in the opinion of every compe-\\ntent judge, lead to the complete and early\\nsuccess of the operations at Warca as elsewhere,\\nand loo much credit can scarcely be given to\\'\\nGeneral Chute for the ready and able way in\\nwhich he lias adopted and applied to regular\\nmilitary practice the lessons to be learnt from\\nthe experience of the colonial forces.\\nThe native contingent on the East Coast has\\nbeen gaining fresh laurels, and the rebels we\\nmay hope have been gaining new experiences\\nwithin the last few days. The rebels who were\\ndefeated so often by the combined native and\\ncolonial forces under Major Frazer, retreated on\\nthe difficult country at the head of the river \\'\\nWairoa, where in the very inaccessible district\\nround the Waikarcmoana Lake, where the river\\ntakes its rise, they considered themselves safe\\nfrom molestation. Such was not the view of\\neither Major Frazer or the friendly chiefs who\\nfollowed them up with about 400 fighting-men.\\nOn the 11th and 12th days of this month a\\nsevere scries of skirmishes were fought close to\\nthe banks of this large and romantic lake\\nwhere the rebels had erected a pa of some\\nstrength. The struggle seems to have been\\nsevere, and the arts of the defending party were\\nso clever that it seems hard that they\\nshould have proved so ineffectual. On the\\nsecond day the victory of our men was so well\\nestablished that the rebels, having lost their pa,\\ntook to their canoes, and favoured by the fine\\nweather-in windy weather the lake is too\\nstormy for ennocs-made their escape, leaving\\nforty-one dead bodies behind them. Many, no\\ndoubt, were wounded in the affair on their side,\\nas thirteen were on ours. The greatest chief of\\nthe Wairoa was left dead by the rebels, as well\\nas five or six men of leading rank. Amongst\\nthe loyal dead (twelve) there were no men of\\nnote ; but old lhaka, a great chief and warrior,\\nwho was, in fact, commander-in-chief, was\\nrather badly wounded in the thigh.\\nThere is no news of further fighting at\\nOpotiki, but some may be daily expected. The\\nescape of some fifty-three native prisoners from\\nthe hulk at Wellington, effected hythe removal\\nof a port and dropping into the water or a boat\\non a stormy night has caused some sensation.\\nThe principle of keeping these men shut up in a\\nhulk doing nothing beyond eating and sleeping\\nhas long been condemned by the colonists, and\\nthis second escape may perhaps stir up the\\nGovernor to consent to some more reasonable\\nplan. They were offered to Otago as hard-labour\\nmen, it may be remembered, bul the offer was\\nnot accepted owing to a mistaken notion that\\nthe chiefs would not work. The old proposal to\\ndeport them to the Chatham. Islands\\nseems better than allowing the poor wretches to\\nmake their escape and lose a large percentage\\nby drowning in the attempt-no less than six\\nout of the fifty-three arc known to have lost\\ntheir lives.\\n\\'Hie confiscation of half a million \\xc2\\xbbf acres at\\nOpotiki, will throw into the Government\\'s hands\\nsome of the first land in New Zealand, and the\\nsettlement of half the 1st Waikato Regiment\\nupon part of it will give security, and therefore\\nvalue to the remainder, which can at no distant\\ndate be sold for a good price. The province\\nof Auckland is promised a further loan of a quar-\\nter of a million to enable her\" to deal satisfac-\\ntorily with the ceded Waikato territory, but\\nhow the money is proposed to be used by the\\nProvincial Executive does not yet appear.\\nMr. Weld, the late Premier of this colony,\\nhas announced his retirement from public life\\nowing to ill-health. Had he done so before he\\nheaded a Ministry he would have carried far\\ndeeper regrets with him than he now can do\\nfrom most of the colony.\\nFrom the papers, per tho Prince Alfred steamer, wo quote\\nas follows :\\nUnder the head of Native Intelligence, in the Southern\\nCross, that journnl publishes somo \"gleanings\" on the\\nnativc question, which are not without thoir significance, and\\nfor the accuracy of which it vouches.\\nWo learn that many Europeans havo recently ponotratod\\ninto tbo bcai t of the disturbed districts, amongst the Pal\\nMnrire fanatics. With several of those tourists, wo have\\nhad an opportunity of speakincr. Starting from Auckland, and\\ngoing up to tho Waikato and Thames countries, ono remark\\nis made by all tourists-namely the diminished numbors of\\ntho natives. On being questioned regarding the cause of\\ntheir decrease, they state that the loss by war did not nearly\\nso much niTect them as tho loss by disease. Affeotiona of\\nthe throat and chest have been the chief agency in carrying\\noff (he native people ; and as they have, as a rule, gono book\\nto the licentious and communistic practices, in voguo\\ntwenty-five or thirty years ago (amongst othors, the whare\\npiihi), theie can bo little doubt that the mortality witt\\nincrease. . ,\\nSeveral gentlemen who penetrated into a comparatively\\nunknown country, in tho interior, were treated ovcrywhere\\nwith marked respect and kindness. They attribute tats to\\nwhat took place a short time previously at Matamata, wita\\nThompson. It would appear, as the natives report, that a,\\ndeputation from all tho inland tribes, numbering about tut)\\nmen, waited on Thompson, asking him to lead the tnbos ut\\nan attack on Auckland. Thompson isBaid to liave asked\\n.\\'Do you know tho way to Auckland?\" After a pauso,\\nthe deputation repliod-\" No ; but wo look to you to shoir\\nus tho wav.\" Thompson said-\" I tried to take Aucklani\\nonce, and! lost one eye.
