They came of bold and roving stock that would
not fixed abide;
They were the sons of field and flock since e'er
they learnt to ride.
We may not hope to see such men in these de-
generate years
As those explorers of the bush-the brave old
pioneers.
'Twas they that rode the trackless bush in heat
and storm and drought;
'Twas they that heard the master-word that called
them further out;
'Twas they that followed up the trail the moun-
tain cattle made,
And pressed across the mighty range where now
their bones are laid.
But now the times are dull and slow, the brave
old days are dead
When hardy bushmen started out, and forced
their way ahead
By tangled scrub and forests grim towards the
unknown west,
And spied the far-off promised land from off the
ranges' crest.
Oh! ye, that sleep in lonely graves by far-off ridge
and plain,
We drink to you in silence now as Christmas
comes again,
The men who fought the wilderness through
rough unsettled years--
The founders of our nation's life, the brave old
pioneers.
The man who beats the large drum should
never be encouraged to beat the record.
It is a consolation when another man is in
trouble to think that it will prove a valuable les-
son to him.",Australian Town and Country Journal ,"444,931,707,1038,857,1041,393,1081,308,1038,183,1038,523,1040,382,1039,358,1040,440,1039,373,1038,332,1038,312,1038,703,1046,207,1045,266,1044,467,1040,181,1008,919,1008,1033,239",Sat 19 Dec 1896,"264,360,428,463,506,6033,6079,6113,6160,6191,6239,6292,6335,252,299,346,394,441,486,6018,6066,6107,6155,6194,6244,6274,6324,246,292,343,388,432,478,6005,6051,6153,6193,6232,6272,6313","727,478,594,414,495,426,504,384,504,425,501,426,503,1508,1590,1511,1591,1511,1592,1524,1603,1523,1602,1523,1602,1522,1603,2607,2687,2609,2689,2611,2691,2622,2700,2657,2617,2659,2617,2617",71302175,Page 17

I WOULD not nurse a lovely thought
apart;
Mine be the task supreme.
To whisper through the great world's
throbbing heart
The message of a dream!
Ah! glowing vision that intrigueth me;
Ah! gracious calm of solitary peace;
Yet Beauty, worshipped lone, might
barren be,
But shared, it hath increase.
O! Singer, dreaming on the mountain
height,
Take all the shining hours vouch-
safed thee there,
But still come back-thy soul aflood
with light,
And what God gave thee share.
Men are so weary of their treadmill
days,
They sigh even as they count their
barren gains!
A word-a breath-can lift to purer
ways,
And free them from their chains.
So if thy soul, athrill with ecstasy,
Sees some rare vision, deep at
Beauty's heart!
Lift up the veil that other eyes may
see
Nor worship, rapt apart.

Clansmen and kinsmen; the man and his master;

Fast ye poltroons, be a footing it faster;
Come with your trimmest garbs, smiling and gaudy,
With scarlet and sky blue, pink, buff, and tawny;
Furbish your firelocks, have rusted since Bligh's day,
Paddy meets Johnny Bull--Taffy meets Sawney.

Shout for the Governor, Council, and Judges,

Masons, no more I beg handle your mallets;
Woodmen, your mauls and your wedges throw by;
Painters and Poets, your pencils and pallets,
In peace for a season, I beg let them lie.

Men by the creeks, be they saltish or savoury;
March from your upper and nether cool fountains;
Of long beard, and thickened skin, haste ye and
scour ye;
Raze the grey stubbled field, gathered for ages,
Look as ye looked ere each wife was a matron;
Saddle your geldings for very long stages,
March, all in duty bound, thanking your Patron.

First-fleeters, lead the van, head the procession,
Boys very famous in history's story,
Trust me 'tis hard to find warmth of expression,
Fully to tell what ye were in your glory;
March in array then, with banners and badges,
Shout on the way that the sky may rebellow;
Shout for the Governor, Council, and Judges,
Shout till each merry man marks not his fellow.

THE CLOSE OF LIFE.
""Evil is wrought from want of thought
As well as want of heart.""
BEND closer, mother, for my voice is weak,
And I would speak a little ere I die.
I have been dreaming, mother. Is ar ilieam
I stood within the same old cottage porch
Where, in the summer evenings, yon and I
So often sat, and sewed and read br turns.
I looked toward the village, bnt a mist—
A thick, dense mist, that deadened every sound
And shut out every sight—was o'er tbe place.
Then while I wondered vaguely whence it came,
It vanished utterly, and I could see
The rosy sunset glinting on the cave
Of quaint thatched houses in the village street,
And fields a-golden with the ripening corn.
I heard the sheep-dog barking on the Mil-.
The lowing of the cattle in the vales.
And all the homely sounds of village life;
And you were with ue as you used to be,
The calm-browed mother of the olden days.
Awhile I stood as in a pleasant trance,
Tongue-tied for very Joy; then fell the mist,
and all was dark and silent as before.
Have I been long ill, mother * I have lost
AU count of time since that most awful night
When first I felt the horror of my fate.
And knew the gift thst most of all I prized,
The power of thought, was ebbing fast away -
And that the dread of auch calamity
But brought it nearer to me. I had borne
Weariness, cold, ay. hunger—they were all.
Bet side by side a ith thi* most deadly blow,
Bnt aa the sighing of the gentle wind
Is to the raging of the mighty storm.
I made one fierce, wild straggle for the light.
Then sank in total da-fr-i-a*.
_ _  Blame them 9 80,
They paid me fairly what they thought enough.
And if, from lack of health or lack of strength,
I failed to do my work, why they could count
On hundreds who would fill my vacant place,
Perhape at lower wagea They were born
To be our rulers, and will grudge no Jot
Of what they deem their birthright. Small or nest.
The godlike Intellect of power must bow *»--■-■-
Before the throne of Mammon. And because
Of all God's gifts it is most freely given,
Onr Mammon-worshippers make light of it,
At least in value of tbe things that serve
Their need or pleasure. If their horae or dog
Beem restless, heavy-eyed, or ill at ease,
WUI they not look to find a cause for it ?
And, side by side with theae dumb brutes, are wa,
Their human slaves, not worth a passing thfmgtit t
I see things clearer than I did of old.
And in a stronger light; a* d I have learnt
The lesson that a modern poet taught—
The aad. stern truth, that evil oftls wrought
As much from want of thought as want of htsvrt,
O for a Uttle of the fire and strength
That nerved the ancient prophets to' their work-
To roase this sleeping world to life agaia.
And teU the men who hold high place in it
That all Christ's lessons in two thouaand yean
Have failed to teach them common charity 1
That he who spends his talent on himself,
Without a thought for all the world beside.
Is worse thau he who hides and hoards it up.
> Tia useless til 1 For Dives feasts within
On richest.viands, served on choicest plate,
And Uttle recks that, by the outer gate,

Nay, mother, lam calm; and if my weeds
Seem the outpouriags of an angry mind,
I am not thinking of myself, bnt those—
My fellow-sufferers in thia city here—
Who day by day toil far beyond their strength
To keep themselves above starvation point
Thirg you, because the world looks coldly on
And sees them suffer, Chri.t looks coldly too r

Stood aghast, at the door of a dealer-retail,
To hear from a puncheon this wonderful tale.
The puncheon was empty, and rolled to the door,
More empty, more loud,--""Have I met you once
more,
My last and kind master, and thou, my old friend,
Hear a story,"" quoth puncheon, ""I pray you attend.
""On ship-board, my brethren and I heard the rubs
Of sailors, who called us ""the devil's own tubs;""
Who yet condescended to ask for our aid
The moment the signal for sailing was made.
""And visited me and another so oft,
That soon not a man could take turn up aloft:
But some of the scorners were thrown from the yard;
And, to hold in the mischief, the hold was well barr'd.
""So we sail'd unmolested to fair Sydney Cove,
And first heard your voice, sir, exclaim from above,
'Forty puncheons of rum, mark X, crowfoot, O,
To be sent to the stores of John Wholesale and Co.'
""The duty all paid, I remember full well,
The guage in my side my dimensions to tell;
And how long they chatted of gallons and proof,
And dues for the country's good use and behoof.
""This wrong I resented: Oh, once give me leave,
Good folk, you'll pay double, said I, in my sleeve.
Then brought to the store, I had not rested long
Before you accused me of being too strong.
""Advised my depletion, and water'd my blood;
But, fearful of losing a drop of what's good,
The surplus you took from a brother and me
You gave to a third, and we two became three.
""So ready for sale, and bound down to a dray,
I came to the place where you met me this day,
And sent to the cellar, I felt rather glum,
I knew I was nothing but water and rum.
""Mine host gave me cooling enough for a frog,
And changed my condition to two-water grog;
But to keep me from dying, presented a jug,
Containing a potion of stimulant drug.
""Now drawn through a pipe, on the counter I sped,
To prey on the vitals, to dizzy the head;
To beggar the husband, the father, the wife
To lay hold of reason, to seize upon life.
""To nerve the assassin, the prisons to fill;
Like-pistols and swords I was licensed to kill.
I drew upon Death, and he honor'd the bill,
'Twas a draft signed by Alchohol, Brothers, and Still.
""Since I saw you good sir, the bell has toll'd thrice,
For men whom I sent from the world in a trice:
One felo-de-se, one cut short at his door,
One shot while obtaining more rum at a store.
""And many more hasten reverses to meet,
Of health, mind, and morals--but Rum is so I sweet
They still call for more, and the temperate men,
Will run the career of the drunkard amain.
""So though I am empty, and my work is done,
You still may buy spirit by puncheon and tun;--
A new race arrives, unwarn'd by the past,
You'll sell your consignments, and get money fast.
""Remember good sirs, (as I bid you farewell
And haste to the place where old mammon doth dwell,)
I leave you a token, the merchant shall find,
His clerk has embezzled--his wife is unkind.
""For both have just tasted--your liquor they took.
Then why, merchant, why, give that horrified look?
On an errand of mercy, you sent me to roam,
Then why not receive my kind visits at home?
""And you, Mister Pub., must now pay up the score,
Contracted by mixing and drugging me sore;
Your boy is a drunkard, but ten years of age,
And wife drams a little her grief to assuage.
""And you, though so sober, because you abstain,
Will soon taste a little and follow the twain;
And so making congé to bid you adieu,
I'm clear in discharging my duty to you.
''Farewell, for the present, I'll see you again;
In sicknss, a story alleviates pain;--
I'll call again, then, and be in at the death;
I'll prove a near friend at your last drawing breath.
""So not to detain you--haste, haste on your way!
Eternity's length, and the great Judgment day,
Will grant us a meeting and then I can state
The fullest results of the tale I relate.""",The Colonist ,"1041,773,649,1022,1013,891,987,1089,1063,159,1063,1119,1050,1104,1048,934,762,988,1103,1086,983,1063,984,1088,889,1057,1033,1075,1052,1086,1003,894,1029,918,914,1007,983,1071,1011,871,1058,1030,942,1111,1088,940,905,1051,844,995,1102,1065,1071,1058,840,965,896,1079,1006,983,984,1061,1016,1058,1066,1097,1078,977,1036,1079,926,953,1059,985,935,1080,1125,1020,1032,842,986,1032,1061,1048,1066,1059,1055,948",Thu 16 Jul 1835,"1795,1857,1917,1972,2019,2068,2116,2197,2245,2305,2341,2390,2453,2511,2559,2605,2681,2730,2779,2827,2899,2942,2997,3045,3119,3162,3218,3261,3345,3394,3441,3489,3575,3624,3672,3721,3805,3852,3898,3949,4033,4084,4128,4176,4247,4288,4344,4392,4475,4522,4572,4619,4697,4744,4792,4845,4928,4974,5024,5072,5147,5196,5243,5287,5373,5417,5516,5563,5639,5690,5741,5784,5866,5918,5967,6008,6092,6141,6188,6231,6314,6361,6408,6444,6537,6580,6631,6680","3907,4053,4174,3898,3901,3898,3897,3896,3923,3959,3895,3897,3897,3897,3896,3895,3896,3894,3894,3894,3895,3892,3895,3895,3894,3883,3888,3895,3910,3892,3892,3893,3893,3893,3892,3887,3892,3887,3890,3890,3890,3888,3890,3890,3889,3887,3886,3887,3927,3887,3887,3894,3886,3887,3888,3887,3884,3887,3884,3880,3886,3880,3885,3888,3887,3877,3878,3885,3883,3878,3883,3880,3882,3881,3882,3880,3881,3881,3882,3881,3884,3905,3884,3887,3884,3885,3879,3887",31716722,Page 6

I THE SPELL OF THE WESTERN
PAWN.
Oh! I've been held by a wondrous spell
while the dawn line spread its arc,
[While I restrained a quadruped haif
on for an equine lark.
I've loved the zest of the dawn out
west, but now, here in the towns
The steeds I know are tired and slow,
poor work-worn bays and browns.
So while the dawn is lifting the cast
I lie and picture scenes
Hade up of men and camps and gear
and equine kings and queens.
In here the rows and miles of homes
blot out the lift of dawn
That outback fades and widens away
like night-worn blinds. withdrawn;
And none here knows of the winds that
blow like nectar night distilled.
J4nd all the prance and eagerness of my
steeds has long been killed.
So while I hear poor milk cart slaves
here breaking the dawn's soft hush
I let my vagrant mind go back to those
camps in the dawn-lit bush.

rolled back for the coming day,
J*ve felt entranced while a live steed
danced, but I hadn't a word to say,
For thought, is small in the silence, all
too full of a sense of awe
That holds while the dawn is lifting its
spell in the thrill of the short
wind raw,
Bo while I etch my pictures here while
day breaks int^ the room
J know the spell of the western dawn
as it rolls back the night-time's
gloom.

BACK TO ZENDA.
Through Rurltania's valleys,
No more the war-notes ring,
No rebel Elphberg rallies
In arms against his king.
No word at midnight spoken
Bids loyal swordsmen ride.
Time and wild war have broken
The princes and their pride.
Yet still in Ruritania
When fairy lights are lit,
A princess like Titania
May at her window sit.
Still mounts the traveller daring
A throne, If not for long,
And proves, through love's despairing,
A king can do no wrong.
Strange kingdom, never charted
On maps that schoolmen know,
It hath not all departed,
Your pomp of long ago.
O land of lost renownlng,
While youth's last star endures,
Twill glisten for the crowning
Of summit- such as yours.

Long I've been a licensed poet ;
Editors have printed me ;
Paid for my poetic flow-it
Hasn't rippled easily.
Now, it seems, they are my nurses ;
Wardsmen, kindly, grave and sad,
Editing my various verses.
Me, poor me — ? Oh, I am mad !
I'm. a mad poetic writer,
Who can't do much good in prose.
My thoughts eeem to go off brighter
Blessed in printer's funeral clothes,
Accompanied by orchestral strumming,
Turn, turn, turning, grave and glad
Bees inside my bonnet, huming :
'Metaphorically mad!'
Strange enough, my keepers pay me
For my lapses (so absurd I)
Each one in an expert way, he
Knows where to exchange a word,
Where to huve a stop deleted.
How to blunt a caustic line,
With an ere for things completed
Just a bit more cute than mine.
^Whst of those who read with pleasure
My mad writings ; folk galore,
Who fill mind voids with good measure
Of escape from things that bore ?
This great host — is it so foolish
That it has to find a loon
And -with a, persistence muleish.
With it's loonatic commune t 1
Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! That's my gay humour;
All in my poetic flow,
Folk are thoughtless who assume a
Pool's mad. They do not know
Inmates of this world asylum

SIR,
Sat verbum Sapienti.
I have amused myself in speculating
in what degree acts the benighted effu-
sions and ribald language of two of your
eloquent and sapient contemporaries on
the minds of the native youth in this
Colony, and I am come to the conclusion
founded on the pliability of youthful
minds, and their aptness before maturity
to take impressions of vice or virtue,
that these worthy co-partners in base
calumniation, and ill-judged scurrility
is that Basilisk, whose malign influence
is detrimental to the virtue and morality
if the Australian youth. Perhaps you
may consider this too cimmerian an hypo-
thesis--too Utopian. But in order to
establish this, and to convey to the reader
that it amounts to an axiom, I will illus-
trate by observing, that the disseminating
of factious and seditious notions (espe-
cially countenanced and supported by the
pen of juggling priestcraft) against an
administration such as we enjoy under
Governor Bourke, is ever the means of
wheedling young minds from their proper
occupation, and perverting the natural
courses of good understandings from the
channels of duly and of virtue. The
idea of a democracy, oligarchy, republic,
or aught else, would be pleasing, because
of its breaking monotony, it would be a
thing to talk of--something that would
affect and keep alive speculation, and
divest the mind of lethargy; there would
be in it something so new, so strange,
and astonishing, that it would especially
take hold of the feelings of the young and
thoughtless; and like the fatal fascina-
tion of the rattlesnake, would draw them
voluntary victims into the jaws of fearful
and certain destruction--romance and
enthusiasm are strong qualities in youth-
ful minds; and these heightened by for-
tuitous circumstances, and inflamed by
the daring and uncompromising spirit of
party zeal, become the foundation of a
mind reckless to the well being of govern-
ment, or of social order. It is by the
schismatical doctrines of priests, and the
forcible appeal to our baser passions,
through a corrupt press, that men are
formed for the commission of bold acts,
in open violation of government. If the
press, which should direct the energies,
and form the mind of our native youth,
be prostituted to the exaction of tyranny
against the unfortunate and oppressed,
and the dissemination of lawless mea-
sures, and truculent animosity against an
approved government, we may fairly con-
clude the sad example before the eyes of
Australians will be any thing but condu-
cive to quietude or national prosperity.
I will conclude by observing, it is the
quality--the acting principle of rebel-
lious spirits to lead by their insidious arts
the unwary in the meshes of their guilt,
by cunning and fascinating accounts of
speedy and certain success--the blazing
glory and cushioned ease of power and
ambition. If these arts fail, they mag-
nify the evils of existing things; and
awaken the passions by a forged tale of
tyranny and oppression. All this, most
men of matured understanding can guard
against, and here villainy is cowed by the
bold front of strong discernment. It is to
the gay, the young, and thoughtless, it
looks for support, and among them it finds
the ready victims of folly and presump-
tion. Mercenary wretches, who have
sprung from the canaille--unprincipled
and degenerate caitiffs, who, to screen
villainy, fled ere the arresting hand of
justice had stayed their career, are among
these men (who have become wealthy by
extortion and oppression), who are the
leading members--the acting agents of
that demon sedition, which we must sup-
press. So look ye, Australians, that you
are not led away by the plausible flattery
and golden dreams of mad ambition; nor
make your country the scene of havock
and confusion, but turn your ears from
these levellers, who, under the cloak of
sanctity and morality, carry hypocrisy,
malice, and sedition. Underneath I send
you a few lines, the fragment of a poem
on ""Sydney,"" conveying a timely hint
to the ""faction.""
Far o'er a wide and boundless Ocean borne,
Sometimes becalmed, and sometimes in a storm,
These shores I sought, these distant shores scarce
known,
To ages past--and not all in our own.
Surprised and pleased I viewed th' expansive bay,
And saw where num'rous gallant vessels lay
Secure at anchor. And the busy throng,
Alive to trade and speculation strong,
Moving upon the different wharfs that line
The shore--the infant quays, a pleasing sign
Of mightier efforts in a future time.
And here, says I, scarce fifty years have past,
Since enterprising man commenced the task,
Of rearing in this distant place a town,
Whose rising greatness marks the sure renown--
The boasting glory of a time unborn,
When all the burly and the vengeful storm,
Of fierce sedition and the factious broil
Of party shall have ceased their loud turmoil.
When virtue lifts her head, and vice that erst
With hands reluctant grasped the plough to burst,
The untilled soil shall cease to he the slave
Of despotism, or the sordid knave--
When on the pinions of the restless wind,
The flag of amity floats unconfined,
And civil discord and dissention rash,
With enterprise and commerce no more clash,
When Heralds big with empty bubbles choose
No more to mar good order, and confuse
The social state of things, and cease to vent
Their fulsome dogmas breeding discontent,
When juggling priests, and hypocrites assume
The guardianship of virtue, and presume
To mount the rostrum and pollute the fame,
Preaching contention--not the holy name,
Or acts of him, whose good and peaceful life,
Was never tinctured with the blood of strife,
When these shall cease to walk in evil ways,
And sanctify their calling in the praise
Of amity and charity the best,
And fairest virtues in the human breast:
Then Australia, and not till then thou'll rise,
The greatest nation 'neath these southern skies.

Up with the Flag! Each crimson
Wet with the heart's-blood of our best!
We still can die. We still can hold
Our kinship with the men of old.
We stood the test.
With sword half-drawn all Europe saw""' -
Our sons -go down on veldt and crag.
And traitors, cafe within the law,
Smiled as our handß grew weak in war.
Up with the Flag !
Up with the Flag ! For round it clings
The Shamrock, red with blood.
And Death has splashed with scarlet rings
The war-worn Thistle's downy wings,
And drenched the 'Maple-bud.
The battle-dew's on Leek and Rose,
And Heather of the crag,
All stained and torn the Myrtle shows,
And red with blood the Wattle blows :
Up with the Flag !
We wrought for Peace. The war-storm
broke —
They deemed us thralls.
Unarmed, we reeled before the stroke—
A handful in the cannon-smoke ;
And fierce and fast the rifle spoke :
"" An Empire falls !""
Then came a shout that shook the sea,—
One ringing word—
And Nations leapt to life, to be
One race, one arm for Liberty,
And grasped the sword.
White Dove of Peace, the Wilderness
Of many lands by us was won.
Strong in defeat and in success,
O make us wise in nobleucss
Now war is done.%
Wise in our strength that foesTnay learn,
On veldt and crag,
To love the Flag to which we turn.
Long shall it wave, bright shall it burn !

There has been (says "" Lloyd's Weekly"")
an interesting sitting of the Academy of
Medicine in Paris. Laborde, in presenting
the cast of the head of Vacber, the shep
herd killer, who was guillotined for many
horrible murdeTS perpetrated on shepherd
lads and girls, stated that Vac-her's brain,
presented the morphological characteristic.
of a "" superior brain."" It was comparable
to that of Gambetta. Laborde said that
in other conditions Vacher might have been
a great orator, and a useful citizen, Just as,
also in other circumstances, Gambetta might
have been a great criminal. Vacher was,
he concluded, irresponsible, but the Lyons
experts who declared be was not 'insane
will doubtless defend their report
before 'the academy, the necessary permis
sion having been voted.
The working of the various industries,
both in the United Kingdom and America,
is every day becoming more a matter ol
huge combines. Just now in England the
textile trade is being extensively worked in
this direction. The worsted spinners of the
West Riding of Yorkshire have combined
into a concern which will include 75 per
cent of the trade, with a capital of
£18,000,000. The worsted dress manufac
turers are projecting a cqmbine with a
capital of £20,000,000, while two other com
bines are on the stocks, eacn with a capital
of several millions—namely, the Lancashire
Bleachers' Association and the Association
of Lace Curtain Manufacturers. These
huge trusts should give a splendid lessor*
in economics during the next few years.
In the meantime the opinions of financiers
as to their success or failure differ widely.
Their opponents claim that their huge capi
talisation is dangerously Inflated, inasmuch
as it has been based on recent tat years, and
that the killing of competition will destroy
a stimulant of great value. On the other
hand, supporters of the combination claim
that it commands the very best management
poßßible, while the economies resulting from,
concentration are enormous. In the mean
time a satisfactory feature in connection
with the running of these concerns is that
wageß continue to advance.",The Queenslander ,"241,444,768,804,769,671,376,901,755,701,813,389,814,628,852,753,596,731,500,791,787,389,871,146,477,819,676,745,416,812,393,649,617,488,751,617,650,594,399,848,387,729,845,445,855,898,898,874,898,896,896,896,899,899,899,898,899,895,899,898,893,877,475,858,896,895,896,896,896,897,898,899,871,899,873,897,899,896,893,899,897,899,898,880,898,899,898,898,899,899,899,875,896,899,557",Sat 16 Jun 1900,"2609,4550,2726,2764,2800,2844,2893,2928,2969,3009,3050,3093,3170,3211,3252,3293,3335,3373,3417,3457,3498,3537,3617,3658,3698,3737,3776,3822,3861,3902,3943,3984,4025,4068,4140,4181,4222,4261,4296,4339,4384,4424,4465,4504,4650,4693,4735,4778,4819,4861,4902,4946,4987,5028,5069,5110,5153,5194,5236,5279,5320,5362,5405,5452,5494,5535,5578,5619,5658,5701,5742,5784,5825,5866,5907,5950,5991,6033,6074,6115,6156,6198,6239,6283,6323,6365,6406,6449,6491,6532,6573,6614,6654,6694,6737","3395,3474,3077,3156,3077,3077,3307,3076,3148,3080,3072,3310,3076,3153,3077,3077,3309,3074,3309,3077,3079,3313,3072,3110,3312,3072,3072,3080,3313,3074,3310,3077,3074,3302,3077,3153,3079,3077,3310,3076,3312,3079,3077,3309,3110,3072,3072,3072,3072,3074,3074,3074,3071,3071,3071,3071,3071,3072,3072,3072,3074,3071,3071,3107,3071,3071,3071,3071,3071,3071,3071,3071,3074,3071,3071,3071,3071,3074,3077,3071,3072,3071,3072,3071,3072,3071,3072,3072,3071,3071,3071,3071,3071,3071,3071",18549935,Page 1127

The moon and its broken reflection
And its shadows shall appear
As the symbol of love in heaven,
And its wavering image bere.

The dying light pales slowly in the west;
The shadowy silent presence of the night
Is stealing on to still the world's unrest,
And one by one the myriad stars shine bright,
From her dim realm in calm serenity,
The goddess of the night with peaceful grace
Lifting her pallid, gleaming shield on high,
In regal grandeur takes her silent place.
And through the dimness vast, Night seems to say
In, whispers low, "" Fear not my shadow, Death;
For as from earth I bear thy thoughts away
To dreamland for a space; so when thy wreath
Of life is wrought, cold Death shall close thine eyes
And bear thee to eternal Paradise.""",The Queenslander ,"866,483,672,542,419,216,361,587,483,537,485,222,683,683,659,768,620,741,712,663,820,792,721,786,855,587",Sat 7 May 1892,"380,888,1025,1076,1162,1882,1921,1244,1280,1312,1345,1376,1424,1455,1490,1521,1554,1587,1620,1654,1685,1718,1753,1784,1817,1854","395,575,476,543,603,1022,400,531,567,531,565,1014,369,402,369,402,369,402,369,400,369,402,369,400,369,369",19823768,Page 881

6.8 the sparks of a fire fly up .-avd,
So man uu'-o trouble is horn t
But the darkest hour of night time
Comes just before the dawn.
We live in a world of changes,
And suffering, bravely borne,
May bring us, far from its shni-w
To joy in the smiling morn.
Haply most prized possessions
Take wings and vanish away,
Or the cherished aim of a lifetime.
Fails to attain its s-.vay.
Friends well-beloved may falter,
' Children, with hearts estranged
Tread in the paths of folly,
And Oh ! How our world is
changes.
It seems that man battles vainly,
As one that beateth the air,
However he strive and labour ,
In search of a havon fair.
'Tis then that the soul gives challenge
To the blight of a blank despair,
And the door of a mightier kingdom
Swings wide at the call of prayer.
The same God sifteth the matter,
Who knowB when the sparrows fall.
The winds and the waves obey Him;
His hand is over all.
God with us, who is against us ?
Oh, for vision to understand.
And match with the host victorious
On to the Promised Land.
We look for a fairer country,
Where many mansions are:
Of beauty, grand and glorious,
Beyond our dreaming far.
Sweet hope, serene, immortal,
Shall dwell in the human breast,
Till our hearts have ceased their beat
ing,
And tired, we sink to rest.
Let us trust and work in patience,
That nothing on earth can tire;
And the Lord, Who is love eternal,
Shall give us our heart's desire !

THE clouds drop low as they speed along,
The rain descends both steady and strong:
Creek and gully are rising fast;
Over the forest a misty veil is cast.
And the wind in its strength, as it sweeps past,
Leaves tossing branches and waving grass.
Without a pause the rain falls swiftly down,
Darkening tbe air, inundating tbe ground;
Now scattered around in clouds of spray,
Now falling in a steady, persevering wsy;
No rift in the dull gloomy canopy,
Wind and rain to-day hold- high revelry.

A OOsnoAL twin story is reported from
Dublin. A barber was waited npon one morning
by a nice young gentleman, who desired the
hairdresser's lowest terras per week for keeping
his comely caput in condition. A moderate aum
eras named and accepted. Thereafter the new
customer appeared regulary every day for a
•""close shave,** with frequent additions of sham
pooing and nsireutting, and often twice a day.
I In short, the barber marvelled mneh at the
rapidity with which this young man's beard and
[ hair grew, and the mystery waa only solved after
a considerable lapse of time, when one day "" two
of him "" came into the shop at once for s shave.

Bubolab PHTioaorHT.-We wen lately re
minded in a most striking manner of the
pbflosophiosi fee which a burglar once paid to
Sir Walter Scott in lien of lucre. Our friend
Bicherton, wbo Uvea on the Snow HiU Pike,
hearing that burglan wen about, purchased a
big bull-dog, and put a new lock of approved
and patented construction upon bis stable door.
Within a week from that time his dog had been
poisoned, and tbs patent lock picked, and his
stable robbed. Bir Walter, in his days of law
E notice, waa once ceiled upon to defend a
ouse-breaker at Jedburgh. The feUow had no
money, but hia friends had been friends of Sir
Walter, and the kind-hearted lawyer not only
pleaded his cause, but gained bis acquittaX
After tbe trial the prisoner approached Sir
Walter, and having thanked him for his servioe
rendered, said, —"" lam aory I cannot give you
a fee in money auch as yon deserve; but I wiU
give you two items of information whioh may
be of value to yon in the time to oome, especi
aily if you are to Uve apart from thick settle
ments. First, —a yelping terrier or poodle inside
a house is a better protection than a big dog
outside. Second, —there's no lock that gives a
burglar so much trouble as aa old maty one.
Alamo*.—Never expect a edflehily am
bitions man to be a true friend. The man who
makes ambition hia god, tramples on everything
cue. He wiU oUme upward, though he treads
on the hearts of those who love him best, and
in his eyes yonr only value Ue* in the uae you
may be to bim. Personally, one ia nothing to
him i aad if yon an not rich, or famous, or
Kwerful enough to advanoe his interests after
has got above you, he cares no mon for you.
Why should he ? To aome men,
""""Tis sweet to know then is sn eye to mark
Your coming, and grow brighter when you come,""
but not to him. The "" eye "" cannot put dollan
into hia pocket, nor a notice of bim in the news
paper, or elect bim to a fine position of any
kind. Once, perhaps, in by-gone days, when he
was a less successful man, even your friendship
was of some value; bnt he baa risen above you
now, and hss no need of your favor or your
introduction. Hia compliments, once so freely
dispensed, would be wasted on one of no im*
Krtance; aad by way of nUef to tbe flatteries
atUl utten when it will pay to utter them,
he snubs or is sharp with yon. Very weU;
don't breath a aigh for him, and save your teen
for mon worthy folk, if yon belong to the
weeping sex. True Greatness never yet forgot
the friend of its hour of struggle, but cold
Ambition has neither friendship nor love. In
very earnest yon gave him hand and heart in
those dead daya. In true hospitality yon
welcomed him to yonr hearth and yonr board;
bnt the bread and radishes of friendship are
only bread aad radishes to him. Why should
he aup with you when yonr Position often him
cards for a reception P Yon thought fine things
of him, and you loved him well. No matter
| for that. Yoa have played your part—he his.

Gbobob Samtsox's Haijwhht.—Who oan
teU where the joy from a weU-timed gift even of
a halfpenny may end P "" Fifty yean ago,"" aays
Dr. Spencer T. Hall, the "" Sherwood Forester ""
of literature, "" when I was a Uttle fellow in
corduroys, on going down by the brookside into
Button town on an errand, I dropped a halfpenny,
of some money entrusted to me for a purchase,
into the water, and aa it waa past recovery, I
was nearly broken-hearted with fear of the
possible punishment to follow—not for the loss
of the copper, but for csreleesness and delay,
as tbe Uttle errand waa urgent. At this j uncture
George Sampson, son of a respected widow
residing at Smedley's End, and himself, though
working in a' *toeking loom,' one of the most
respectable youths in the parish, oame by, when,
touched by my grief, he gave me a halfpenny
from his own pocket with a kindly emile, and
walked on. I have many a time wished it were
possible to make bim some adequate return for
my then joy. I' tried it on' once by sending
bim afree ticket to one of my lectures at Mansfield,
but stiU felt be wss un-repsid tiU three or four
evenings since, as I was going down Manchester
road in Burnley. There a tender chUd, about
five yean old, with a small milk tin in its hand,
was sobbing as if its heart would burst, and
after it had passed me some time I learnt that
its grief was from not daring to go home through
having lost a halfpenny. In one flash of memory
I saw the old brookside at Sutton, tbe little
wavelets of water and the yellow sand that had
obscured my own halfpenny half a century
before; and tbe image of dear George Sampson
was there too, with his kindly look as he gave
me another. Retracing my steps I soon found
1 thb Uttle child-girl—standing in terror against a
I dead waU in a by-street, not knowing whioh
j way to turn from fear of a flogging if she went
home without the ' mUk for the baby.' In tbe
name of George Sampson, I msde thst child as
happy as he had once made me. If he be
Uving I trust he wUI bear of the good that half
penny so well bestowed in his youth may still ■
be doing; and if he be gone, let his example
teach young Sutton and Mansfield bow much
joy a timely act of kindness, however alight,
may perpetuate."" It may be added that George,
who in younger days was noted for assisting in
the Sutton Church Sundsy school and occassion
aily helping the ringen and the choir, at weU aa
for never looking at a child without a smile or a
pleasant word or act of aome kind, ia stiU Uving
in aa honorable old age at Mansfield. How
Uttle could be have dreamed, when unostenta
tiously giving tbat copper, of the future career

TASTES AÎÎD OPINIONS.
(From Bentley's AliuelUtny, for June 1844..}
A NEWSPAPER maintaining perfectly impar-
tial opinions in politic» being as difficult to dis-
cover as the philosopher's stoiie, it is proposed
that two edi toi s, of eminent abilities, but of
diametrically opposite opinions, shall conduct
these pages, so that those who like to contem-
plate every view of every subject shall thus
have an opportunity to do so, while such per-(
sons as feel, like the Irish judge,'tiiat to hear
both sides only confuses them, may crnfine
their studies to that which pleases them best.
All reports favourable to either party shall be
confidently stated on one page, and ns conn,
dently contradicted on the other. During evei y
election the probable state of the poll shall he
calculated and conjectui ed with a totally oppo-
site result on corresponding columns ; and, in
discussing the state of Ireland, it shall be de-
scribed on the one side us perfectly peaceable,
and on the other as being evidently on the verge
of a rebellion.
In reviewing hooks, announcing fashionable
changes, or recommending shops, this principle
I shall be rigidly adheied to ; and even a ballot at
a club ein only bo mentioned in those columns
where voting by ballot is advocated.
It is hoped that by thus embracing all par-
ties, "" The Whig and Tory"" may( secure uni-
versal patronage, and that by concentrating the
very essence of all foreign and domestic intelli-
gence, it will entirely supersede all rivals, being
indisputably recognized as the only "" True Sun""
calculated to enlighten ; "" The Times"" to be
the universal ""Standard"" of public opinion;
"" The Record"" of truth ; "" The Chroniclo"" and
"" Herald"" of a brighter morning than ever
before dawned upon the British Empire.
POLICE-OFFICE.
A case, which excited considerable amuse-
ment, was heard in Bow-streef yesterday, when
an old Irishwoman was hrpught up, chaiged
with making a violent assault on her next-door
neighbour, a young girl, also.frpm tbej Green
Isle/ She had torn tfjo bowsccuit of her anta-
gonist's cap, atid finally cut her severely with a
kmle.
"" Surely,"" observed the Magistrate face-
tiously, ""such a belle as you never,can want a
BEAD 1"" (Laughter.)
""An"" sure, your, honour, isn't Bow-street
the very place to come lo for one?"" (Roars of,
laughter.) ' _ ,
"" ' ""'You are'at a loqs for an answer, I see I""
f1 Nor nobody need he here, yofpr honour, that
can say Bo to a goose."" t (Shouts of laughter.:)
; *« You deserve the bow-sttjngjfor your, impu
dence,! t But wo must ti y what a few weeks in
Newgate will do.""
"" That's a New-gait to me, youl honour, and
a very awkward gate too. If'tvveie a five-barred
one 1 'd clear it anyhow ; but I don't agree with
confinement."" (Laughter.)
"" Thon, why don't you agree better with your
neighbours ? It is a serious business to use a
knife, und gives them a strong handle against
youl""
"" I only outs my disagi eoable acquaintance
in the sti eet, as the quality does.""
"" But, then, it was on this occasion cut and
come again.""
"" No knife can be sharper than your honour's
wit, anyhow 1 Sure it 's rutting and maiming
of me that you are, as the leg of mutton said to
the carving-knife. Long life, and many of them,
to your lordship 1""
The culprit was led away, amid shouts of
applause, evidently elated that in the war of wit
she had the hest of it, and obviously satisfied
that the glory covered the disgrace.
VERSES ON A CONVÓLVULOS,
By Lady Adelaide Fiiz Maurice.
There's not a flovv'r of radiant hue,

And when we pluek thy stem so --light,

For soon it withers in a glass,/ , '

plished authoiess of these beautiful gems, (who

LITERARY INTTLLICENCE.
At a meeting of the Boyal Sfoeiety on Mon-
day last, Dr. Cot read some interesting re-
marks on the variations of the pulse occasioned
by people standing on their heads. Pi olessor
Altitude afterwards produced an elaboi ate i ssay
on the present alteration of our atmospheie oc-
casioned by an invisible oomet having lecently
crossed our orbit ; on which he analysed a por-
tion of air, and proved that a new species of
gas had supeivened, which hits a remaikablc
tendency to irritate the temper, nnd to render
people quarrelsome. Mr. Mackenzie then de-
monstrated that we shall have thirteen snow-
storms this winter, one of which will be seven
I feet deep on the 4th of June.
We are desired to intímate that the Royal
Society is now finally dissolved, having nothing
more to learn or to discover.
COURT CIKCULtR.
Some events of considerable importance are
now in agitation, which will cause great sur
! piise in certain qunrters, and must be followed
by consequences of which it is impossible to es
t'unate the ultimate importance. We forbear
for the present to be more explicit.
It is confidently reported that the second son
of a certain Baronet at tho west end of the
town is about to lead to tho nymemal altar the
daughter of an eminent mcicantile character,
who lives not a bundled miles fimn the city.
The venei able Lord C.uler-Idi is has, with
his usual liberality, desii ed a cat t of coals to
bo distributed among his njimi i ous poor te-
nantry near the villuge of Barmouth.
[ A dnerthemenl.]
Mrs. Smith has begun her course of dinners
for tho season. We understand she lias had
apologies fioin several invited puests of the first
distinction, and expects onÍFrnlay next two
Polish Princes, and several Members of Par-
liament. |
PUBLIC DINNER ANO TESTIMONY.
A gold watch and appendages was presented
yesterday to Monsieur Philips, the celebrated
French conjuror, on account of his recent exer-
tions for the public amusement^ and a dinner of
his friends and admirers took ¿lace at the Crown
and Anchor tavern. On this occasion he exhi-
bited a few novel and amusing tricks, having
turned a gentleman's coat without the wearer
being conscious of it. He also threw a quan-
tity of ribbon, silk, and huelo am into a huge
wheel, when imiiediately several beautifully
shiped, fashionable bonnets>wire produced ;
and he undertook, when any lady hail turned
her silk driss luke, to bring tout a thud hide,
which should look as good as new. To con-
clude the evening, after returning thanks for
the honour done him by the ladies and gentle-
men present, who were 710 conjurors, hu pro-
posed as a toast, with true French gallantly,
""Petticoat government; being the only legiti-
mate government which has continued uninter-
rupted since the creation."" Tune-""And ye
shall walkin silk attne."" ,u
niOH-FLVINO EXTRAORDINARY.
During the 1 ite severe hurricane, a remark-
ably fine hoy, ten years of age, was observed on
his way to school, when turning a sharp corner
towards Westminster Bridge, the wind sud-
denly caught his umbrella, a<id blew him ra-
pidly along tow aids the new Houses of Parlia-
ment. He clung tenaciously to the handle, till
a violent blast lifted him at length from the
ground, and, when last seen, le was flying over
the roofs of some houses in Hyde Park Place,
towards Bayswater. The distance rendevod
him at last invisible to the nil.ed eye ; but if
any one can send intelligence which may re-
store bim to his afflicted parents« a handsome
reward shall be given. ¡ *

A Public Meeting of Ladies took place in
Exeter Hall jestcrday, to consider the best
means of relieving and utterly abolishing all
cases of distress, when a Committee of Ways
and Means was appointed, and a subscription

sent devoted th""insehes to ti weeks'hard labour
to further the objects of the meeting.
Among the generous contributions on this
occasion we observed 130 pin-cushions, 310
purses (empty), 49 cigar cases, 590 dolls, and

trust, theieibre, that he may long continue to
""Raise the wind,"" and spiead out his canvass
before a favourable breeze.
IMPORTANT DISCOVERT.
A Smoothing-iron, on a perfectly new con-
struction, has been recently invented at Paris,

fomentation of vitriolic acid.

SONG,
By an old Gentleman at a Charity Sale.
Oh no I I never purchase them,
Their price 1'vo never heard,
My purso is now forbid to pay
For toys I can't afford.
Fi um booth to booth they hurry me,
'1 hat bargains I may get,
And when they win a pound from mo,
'Tis much to my regr< t.
Thev tell mo to be buying now
The gc« gawa of the day,
They hint that I should purchase trash,
But I heed not what they say.
Porhaps, like me, they never knew """"
With empty purse to frit ;
But, if they buy as I have bought,

SPACE that is more than awful—ocean, air, and land-
Stretch evermore between me, oh my love, and thee.
Our lives are far apart; and we, once hand In hand,
Have now between us rolling awful space and sea.
I cannot tell thy thoughts, I may not xee thy face ;

Yet love, our love ia strong ; and thro' it's holy grace
Space shrinks away appalled, and dictanoe is forgot.

RURAL COURTSHIP.
He-Fair as the snowdrop's virgin leaf,
Or heatherbell that decks the heath.
Or lilly, when her cheeek grows red
With crimson blush by rose bud shed,
Or violet with drooping head,
So lovely is my Mary.
She-The morning sun makes nature gay;
The gushing streamlet's morning lay
Delights the flocks, as on its side
The sportire lambkins careless glide,
In thoughtless glee, in nature's pride;
So dear to me is Willy.
He-The rich in luxury may pine
And honour, wealth, their lord may tine
Ambition sigh at glory's goal
Hy heart's the needle, thoa the pole,
And oh! what bliss would fill my soul,
If thou wouldst be mine, Mary.
She-Though all that wealth could give were mine,
How dimly would each jewel shine;
Each sparkling ray would be a dart,
Would ceaseless deadly wounds impart;
If wanting thee, dear Willy!

Spidertee.
A.M. MORLEY.
Said Spider father to his son:
"" Do you as others do;
Make now a fresh home for yourself,
One big enough for two.""
So Spidertee went out one day,
And found a lovely place;
A snug bole in the ground be made,
And hung with cobweb laoe.
A door be made round as a plate
It fattened with a snap,
And if yon wished togo inside
Too always bad to tap. ' '
Said Spider father: •• If yon go
Away, ob, do take care
To olos ■ your door behind you,
And of boys with sticks beware.
"" Hera in your cupboard I trill place
Two beetles and a fly,
If you will now take my adrios
You'll make a beetle pie.""
It was a snug and pretty house,
As Spidertee well knew;
He wished his spider chains could see
The things so bright and new.
They would not oome, of course, that day.
But he could an them oall;
80 down he took his walking stiok,
And then his hat so tall.
He went to see the Bpider-girl
He was so soon tow d. - .
Alas! he found she had a cold,
And so had gone to bed.
His hat they all remarked upon, '
They liked his eyeglass, too,
But they liked best of all his coat
And little breeki of blue.
He would not stay for sapper, for
He said 'twas growing late;
Bat when he reaohed his home he found
It in a dreadful state.
The lace from off the walls was torn.
His bed lay on the floor;
The beetle pie was gone, and gone
The knocker from the door.
He did not stay to look again,
But to his mother ran,
And reusing her from sleep at onoa
To tell his woes began.
""Oh, Spidertee,"" was all she said,
"" Your door was not made fast.
And spider-robbers saw your house
fcmpty when going past.
"" I would not tell your Slimbluegee
Until it is set right,
Or she will always be afraid
If yon go ont at night.""
But Slimbluegee's gray mother heart;
Said she: ""Yon ne«d no more
Count for your bride oar SHmblaegee,
Who cannot guard your door.""
Poor Spidertee! It was too true,
And his own flimblaegee
Was married to a sptdor-boy
Who came across the sea. .
He made himself another borne, • '
And died a bachelor,
And all because when he went oat
He did not look the door. \",The Queenslander ,"805,438,263,255,490,555,615,420,515,433,594,473,544,395,504,675,515,379,516,527,607,366,516,433,526,406,633,501,702,449,575,403,496,674,512,401,708,469,557,404,557,457,677,357,615,411,571,463,494,378,588,383,561,518,587,404,589,323,466,387,641,504,637,510,556,425,480,669,702,350,572,491",Sat 2 Oct 1897,"224,369,520,3222,592,628,660,694,748,781,814,847,902,937,969,1003,1058,1091,1124,1159,1211,1246,1277,1313,1369,1402,1431,1468,1524,1557,1592,1625,1680,1713,1746,1781,1835,1869,1902,1937,1991,2024,2057,2091,2145,2180,2213,2247,2301,2334,2369,2402,2457,2491,2524,2559,2613,2647,2680,2713,2767,2803,2836,2869,2926,2957,2994,3027,3080,3117,3150,3183","2389,2639,2668,2969,2483,2543,2483,2517,2483,2515,2483,2515,2485,2518,2485,2520,2485,2517,2485,2515,2485,2517,2485,2518,2485,2518,2485,2518,2487,2518,2487,2520,2485,2521,2488,2518,2488,2520,2487,2521,2488,2521,2488,2521,2488,2521,2487,2521,2488,2521,2488,2523,2488,2523,2490,2524,2491,2524,2488,2523,2491,2524,2491,2524,2491,2521,2490,2526,2493,2526,2491,2526",24470298,Page 655

TO A NATIVE GIRL.
TUNE--""A WET SHEET AND A FLOWING SEA.""
Here's a health, my sprightly native lass,
Ten thousand healths to thee!
May joys that earths's ne'er surpass
Thy worldly portion be!
And may those liquid eyes of blue
Still in their brightness glance;
Those dewy lips of ruby's hue
No painting can enhance.
Oh! well Australia's sons may boast
Of sisters such as thou,
And quaff with bounding hearts the toast,
As fondly I do now;
For eyes like thine might light a brand
In duller hearts by far,
Than those which grace this new-found land,
'Neath Ocean's Southern star!
Sweet girl! In whatever land
It be my after-lot,
To fall 'neath Time's remorseless hand,
Thou ne'er wilt be forgot.
Thy sunny smile—thy artless face,
A beacon still shall be,
Which Time himself can ne'er efface
From my fond memory!
Then here's to thee! sweet Native Lass,
The anchor now is weighed—
The wind blows fair, and objects pass,
Alternate to the shade;
But still, as dimmer grows the shore
In the blue and sparkling sea,
My bounding heart re-echoes more,
""Here's a health, sweet maid to thee!""

When ho foll in tho wator ho ruined the .'ot.

Of powder and paper in piles of dead leaves ;
But tho only result was of patience tho tiring,
Tho fuel was damp, and no blaze ho achioves.
Again and again, wo shoot him-'twas shocking
But still ho clings fast just beneath a big bough,
With his ugly groat tail sticking out as if mocking ;
Wo felt ho was chuckling in scorn at us now.
At last 'twas so late that wo thought of returning
All torn, bruised, ¡iud bleeding, with divers mishaps ;
Wc sneaked [into bed, all sympathy spurning

(Over this road running west through the Gar-
dens to the Children's Hospital Melbourne mothers
carry their children day by day.)
This is the road the fainting go on Summers
keen and bold.
And this the way of the wounded in bitterness
and cold.
Oh, some are proud in the loving arms, and
some too faint to sigh.
I am with God in a reverence when Mother
Love goes by.
They tell me that the city dust has filled the
trees with grime,
And the flowers are pale-I will not have such
heresy in my rhyme!
For the rainy eyes of the children have left
them sweet and fair--
There is no stain on the clean gardens when
Mother Love is there.
They tell me that this wide city is black with
every sin,
And that heaven's gates are shut so fast we
never may crowd in.
But the woes of little eyelids will teach us
how to pray,
And our eyes will all go mothering wich
Mother Love to-day.
Vainly I seek the scented word, the witness
of the Spring,
Glad with the honey at the heart for long
remembering,
But dumb I am to the clean earth and dumb
to the great sky--
I am with God in a reverence when Mother
Love goes by.

HORÆ CATNACHIAÆ.
Under this funny and fantasticle title a
very capital article haa been furnished in
Fraser's Magazine : the insight which it affords
into the penetralia of low life is extremely en-
tertaining and not a little instructive. What
a strange affair is human nature, and especially
the human nature of low or vulgar life ! We
have been so much amused ourselves with
some of the Catnach-es, that we feel desirous
to impart some portion at least of our enter-
tainment to our numerous and kind readers.
We should, however, premise, that Mr.
Catnach was, to a grat extent, printer and pub-
lisher of sundry poetical effusions, commonly
called street-ballads, and that this worthy pa-
tron of the muses lived either in Seven Dials,
Spitalfields, or some equally out-of-the-way
place, and has since retired on a comfortable
independence. From whom Mr Catnach pro-
cured his "" POETRY;"" we have no means of
ascertaining, but certainly the specimens
which the writer in Fraser has produced, are
extremely clever, rich, and racy.
The first we shall refer to, is a most dismal
and deporable "" Lament,"" from a young, lady,
named Sarah Collins, which Lament compri-
ses a very awful description of Van Diemen's
Land, in reference to the ill and cruel treat-
ment of those most interesting of "" woman-
kind,""—the assigned female servants. Among
other lamentations, Miss Collins thus delivers
herself:
"" They chain us two by two, and whip and lash
along,
They cut off our provisions, if we do the least thing
wrong,
They march us in the burning sun, until our feet are
sore.
So hard's our lot now we are got upon Van Diemen's
shore.
We labour hard from morn to night, until our bones
do ache,
Then every one, they must obey, their mouldy beds
must make ;
We often wish, when we lay down, we ne'er may rise
no more.
To meet our savage governors upon Van Diemen's
shore.
Every night when I lay down, I wash my straw with
tears,
While wind upon that horrid shore do whistle in our
ears;
Those dreadful beasts upon that land around our cots
do roar ;
Most dismal is our doom upon Van Diemen's shore.
Come all young men and maidens, do bad company
forsake,
If tongue can tell our overthrow, it would make your
heart to ache;
You girls, I pray, be ruled by me, your wicked ways
give o'er.
For fear, like us, you spend your days upon Van
Diemen's shore.""
Whatever may have been the exaggerating
bias of Miss Collin's sprightly imagination,
we give her every credit for the sage and sa-
lutary caution and advice, which is contained
in the last verse of the portion we have quoted.
We are quite sure, that if "" you girls be ruled
by me,"" that is, by Miss Collins, we should not
be tormented quite so much by "" you girls,""
as we are at present ; but we fear that our
hope for such a blessed consummation, is a
very forlorn one.
The best ballad in the bunch is the one en-
titled "" The Pleasing Wife and Satisfied Hus-
band."" It certainly lacks the stern solemnity
and gloomy misanthropism of a Byron-the
chivalrous and picturesque energy of a Scott
the playful melody of a Moore-the conceited
Lakeisms of a Southey, a CoU ridge, and a
Wordsworth-to say nothing of the puling af-
fectations of a Leigh Hunt, and a Johnny Keats
&c. Sec. fee.-but it does possess a genuine,
most original, and most excellent humour,
than which "" none but itself can be its parallel.""
We give it, therefore, at full length, unshorn
of any of its bright beams, and untouched by
tbe cruel hand of criticism :- ,
"" The Pleating Wife and Saiitfied Husband.
"" You married people, Indi and low, come listen to
my song,
I'll shew to j ou economy, and not detain you long;
In ?? lived a tradesman who wished to see things
right,
And to account last Monday morn he called his
loving wife.
Chorus.
Who quickly told lum in a crack which way the
money goes.
When to his wife lie tailed account, as you may well
suppose,
My dear, says he, come tell me how and where mv
money goes ?
Every week I give you one pound one, we have but
children three.
And for my wages every week I very little see.
Well, now says she, if you must know, you shall with
good intent ;
Now first we pay a half-a-erown.cveiy week for rent,
'1 liree-and-sixpence every week (or bread, «ind for
butter, suuar, au I tea
Two and twopence J>>ay out as yon may plainly see.
There is tenpence eveiy week for coals, and sixpence
wood and coke,
Threepence needles, pins, and thread, and sixpence
ha'penny soap,
Three and sixpence every week for meat, three shil-
lings potatoes and greens^ ' '
And then there's threepence halfpenny, every wtek
for milk or cream.
VA eil, now say«: he, we'll reckon up which way the
M, money's gone, ,, a '
Seventeen and just tjiree-halfpence, where's the test
of one pound one ;
There's three and ninepenre-halfpenny left as yon
' perhaps wa'I knows, ° '""t '
So pray inform me where the rest'of my week's waget
goesî ; iii ¡
Every morning for youi breakfast I for you must
something make, * ' ' ' / '
And once or twice a-week 'you know you have a
pound of steak ; . '
That will average one and sixpence more, but that is
not enough, i"" <
You have ninepence for tobacco, and threepence
ha'-'penny for snuff. ,?? ; ,
Well, that's just two and eightpence more, and if you
do your'best, l < ^ ^ ii < > * ""
It will puzzle yW to tell me how and where goes all
! the1 rest, : . r
Nineteen and fivepence-halfpenny I just<reckon up
that's gone, , ,
Then there's one and sixpence-halfpenny remains ol'
one pound one.
Says she yon take me very close, you must.confest
you do,
There's threepence halfpenny every week for soda,
starch, and blue,
A pint of beer T fetch you every day, you see which
way its gone, ' « i
Now reckon up and seewhat'S left, out of your one
pound one. ' ' it,,
Twenty shil lingi« ant* elevenpence is tbe exact amount,
Well now, says she, since you have called me to a
strict account, ¡ -<
There's just one single penny left out of your on«
pound one, < i (
So where dues matches, candles, and all other things
come from I ( , -
Well now, says he, I'm satisfied, your'e right and I'm
content, ' ,'>,,,
But 1 could not imagine how and where the money
went; r
Scarce one man out of fifty the house expenses knows,
But I at last am satisfied which way the money goes.""
This, of its kind, is undoubtedly'the raoBt
exquisite morceau which has ever fallen under
our notjce, and we really think that the moral
which it conveys, is worthy of the most atten-
tive consideration ; the care and kindness of
the wife forming a prominent feature, on the
one side, and the vigilance and exactitude df
the husband on the other. See, also, how far
"" one pound one"" may be made to go, not-
withstanding the somewhat awkward interpo-
sition of the "" children three.""
One more snatch, and we have done. This
relates to Rêverai characters :-To a Police-
man-an Old Woman "" who lived in Green-
wich-town,"" and who, dressed in a soldier's
jacket, drank gin by pailsful-and "" though
last not least,"" to His Grace the Duke of
Wellington, who, the Bard states, lost one
fine morning, "" twelve inches of his nose,"" to
the lively tune of "" tit fal la ra whack Ï"" We
have room, however, only in our present num-
ber, for the Police-man, and the Soldier
woman, to each of whom we can devote but a
couple of stanzas :
"" A policeman, L-, letter K, 249,
In the Mile End road, good iack-a-day, has play'J
some tricks so fine; '
While the butcher for a moment from his Window
turn'd his back, i
The policeman collar'd a piece of beef, like tit fal Ja
w ra whack. >., ,
i'he butcher saw him take the beef, which grieved him
full sore,
So without any more to do he kick'd him from the
door; ,.
1 hey took his trousers, coat, and boots, and order'd
him the sack,
So the commmissioner depriv'd him of his tat fal la
ra whack.
"" AD old woman lived in Greenwich-town, that wore
a soldier's coat,
And to swallow gin she long'd to have the railroads
in her throat ;
As she was coming from Horn Fair, she thought to
have a lark
Sie swallow'd twenty wooden legs, and bolted Green
> wich Park. s *
So to coucfude my ditty, and for to make an end,
They say we shall no taxes pay, then off we'll quickly
send
The rogues that did for taxes call to the^d-- in a
pack ; . ' .>
They may take their books and toddle off, like tit fal
la ra whack."" j *
We may, perhaps, return to this most amu-
sing article, if we find our own opinion re-

MAN, drawing to Iiis latest end
(Beyond the dimly darkening room),
Beholds, afar, each ancient friend,
With pitying looks of anxious gloom.
Astes to ashes ! Dust to dust !
He knows the fateful fiat's come,
Which weans him from each worldly lust¡
With welcome to his unknown home !
«The "" li ttl o soul"" that gave lifo strength,
The ""feohle soul"" wliioh lifo upbore,
And dragged him through existence' length,
He feels grow feebler, moro and more.
With fainter, faintest, fainting breath j ,j'
He feels tho solid globe around
Dissolving, as he sinks in death
And darkness-silent and profound !
The deepest depth of unknown space,
Whore worn-out planets lonely sink
And crumbl?, ns their burnt-out race Q
Descend beneath Creation's brink,
Is not more awful to each star H
Than death is to the par ting,soul,
Which sees Eternity afar, . j
Yet dies - unoertain of life's goal ! . ;
Do fiends come muttering round oar biar ?
Or angels whisper ? as they fold
Their wings of light around tho dear
Departed ono--so calm !-so cold !
Chilling as rmrble to the finger !- .
Tender as flesh ! where'love's last kiss
Across the quiet, sealed lips linger,
Whilst praying for its future bliss.

However humble on this Earth,

So mortal lives - though Heavonly formed
FUI varying forms by Nature's laws

Moulds it or mutilates, or blind ' ' |

TO MORROW.
lîy Mr. Blackman, at 'his Rooms, Hunter^
slreet, at l-l o'clodk-Boltled-Ale,- Porter,'
und Silver Watches.
By «Foss and 'Lloyd, at the Callie Market, al
12 o'clock-Mares, Geldings, &c.
State of tue Country.-The last news
received from tliP several country districts has
no1 in general been of such a favorable descrip-
tion's wo could have wbhed. In the neigh-
bourhood of tho Lower Hawkesbury they have
had a succession of ruins «hieb Listed about
light days, which, of course, is expected to be
very prejudicial to the great quantity of whea't,
both reaped and unreaped, at present on
ibu ground. -In some purls lite wheat has
commenced io grow. The tobacco plants have
suffered to a great extent, 'I he ircsws from
otherp&rts of the country slate that they are
not in suth a bad stale.
Shocking Accident.-On Sunday afternoon
an accident, as melancholy-as any it has ever
been-our painful duty to record, happened near
K»sex-Iaiic. The body of a young child of
20 mouths old, whose name wo have not been
able to ascertain, was-found drowned that after-
noon in a cavity of the rocks which is only
filled willi water in rainy weather. It appeared
that the child's mellier had gone to sleep in the
afternoon, being fatigued by the heal of the
day : dilling which time the child bad in walk-,
ing about fallen bead foietnost into the pool
When The body was discovered life was extinct.
The medical geniLman called gave his opinion
that the child must have been uu hour in the
water.
Mounted Policemen shot.-It was rumoured
through Sydney, yesterday, that two of the
mounted police had been shot by the bushrangers
on the Hunter a few days ago. Thirty of thal
body were despatched last week to exterminate,
or if possible to bring those mauruders to jus-
tice.
Police Oouut.-This court was crowded to
suffocation yesterday, both by visitors theie by
their own consent, and those (here nolens vol na.
No person who left the fresh air would ever
dream of-envying the situation of a Police
Magistrate; the air was absolutely so thick
and rank, dial, in Yankee phrase, one might
almost have cut it with a razor. The drunken
list wag very prolific, and a few other good
cases were brought on.
The Press.-The press of Australia has
lately received two additions in the Geelong
Advertiser and the Perth Gazette. It is now
about lo receive another in the Maitland Ex
. ¡»'ess, and Hunter's River Advertiser. We
wish our new cotemporay that success which
we have no doubt he will merit.
Shocking Assault.-On Christmas night
last, between the hours of nine and len o'clock,
a disturbance took place among a set of drunken
fellows in Essex-street, when it was found ne-
cessary that the constabulary should interfere.
One of (he cons'abuliiry, named M'Grath,- laid
hold of a man who was engaged in the row,
when some person struck bim a severe blow on
the temple which fractured his skull. M'Grath
immediately fell, and was afterwards carried tu
the shop of Dr. M'Kellar, and from thence to
the Hospital, where he now is in a very dan-
gerous state ; indeed, we have been informed
that there is little or no chance of his recovery.
It has not as yet been ascertained who struck
ihe blow.
The Weather.-The weather in and about
Sydney has for the last three or four days been
very delightful, which is very fortunate, con-
sidering the festive season, ami the necessity of
such weather for the ripening of the crops.
Christmas.-This holiday was conducted
with great propriety in Sydney. The streets
displayed the u.-ual number of well dressed per
sons, some going lo church and others on
pleasure excursions. We are, however, gorry
to say that there were a great number of drunken
persons on the street during the evening.
The Constabulary.-These functionaries
paraded the streets on Christmas day in their
new costume, which decidedly is an improve-
ment on the old. That of the water police is
decidedly handsome. We hope that this body
of men will renovate their conduct as well as
their dresses; Heaven knows it much requires it.
The Markets.-The markets, with tho ex-
ception of a few articles, remain firm to their
former prices. Vegetables, we are glad to say,
are much lower, but the staff of life has under-
gone no change.
SuPitEMB Court-The first of January next,
which commences the year 1841, is the first day
of the first quarter of the criminal sittings of the
Supreme Court. We have heard that the list
this session is a very full one. There are three
or four cases for rape lo bo tried; the culprits
for this offence are mostly old men.
r We are requested by Messrs. A. & S. Lyons, I
to contradict a paragraph which appeared in
the Sydney M-oni'or of Friday last, «fating
they had become the purchasers of the schooner
1 Truelove, tiley being agents only to that vessel.
CRICKET MATCH. - A cricket match will
take place on New Year's Day, between the
Australian and Victoria Cricket Clubs. This
match is expected to be strongly contested -
We could not conceive a more appropriate day
for such an amusement. The grounds we ex-
pect will be crowded, and we hope that the
sight of this manly and athletic game will in-
duce many of the young men who are specta-
tors to become members of one or other of
the clubs. We know of no game so conducive
to health.
A Candid Witness.-Yes'enlay a woman
named Muiy Evans wits brought to the bar in
ho Police Court, charged by a mau named
Connolly, who lodged willi lier, wi.h liaviug
stolen a pound note from bim on Saturday
night last. Mr. G. R, Nichols appeared for
the defence. When the witness appeared in the
b 'x he was asked by Mr. Nichols if he.lodged
with the prisoner, when he-answered something
in it low voice.
Mr. Nichols-SpeaTi out bir ; did yon lodge
with the prisoner 3
Witness-(bawling to the full extent of his
lungs) ; to he sure I did.
Captain Innes-To be sure I'd send yon to
the watch-house, if you do not behave in a
proper manner.
Mr. Nichols-Have yon been drinking this
morning?
Connolly-(cooly)-Yes, I have. Mr. Ni-
chols-And pray what did you drink? Cou.
nolly-Why, lot'me see ; I bad two bottles of
ginger beer, and two nobblers of b, andy. Mr.
Nichols - Well, that's very fair before eleven
o'clock ; pray, Connolly, were you drunk last
night ? Connolly-Yes, I was. (Laughter in
the court.) Mr. Nichols-ï thought so! and
wero you drunk the night before thal? Con-
nolly -I was, that «aUhe night of the robbery.
Captain Innes-That will do ! Mary Evans,
you are discharged. And off Mary walked,
her countenance beaming with virtuous indig-
nation.
Teetotaler*.--Yesterday, a meeting and
procession of this numerous body took place.
It was attended by an ¡inmensa multitude. Al-
though no admirers of processions, the nature of
this society and its praisewoi thy object, must
?make it an exception in the minds of all.
Tun Market.-Mr. S. B. 'Curtis has ic
ceived the appointmeulof Cb rk of the Market.
His Excellency the Governor outjht to give
ordets to have that street made passable leading
down to ihe Village of Double Bay; a serious
accident happened the other day, and many
more which naver reach Sydney. We trust
the numerous residents in lhat quarter will have
this indispensable request granted.
The Rev. Mr. Davy has arrived in the Cuba,
to replace the Itev. Air. Churton, who proceeds
to the Buy of Islands. The Rev. Mr. Davy
being a candidate for orders, is not yet compé-
tent to fulfil all the duties.of his sacred office.
Weare informed that Captain Williams, of
the schooner Jane, has luid down the keel of a
vessel-of uboui 25 tons, which he expects lo be
afloat in four months. When finished she is
intended for the trade of this port ; andas
her owner served seven years willi Curling,
Cox, and Co., the great ship builders of Roth
erhilhe, we expect lo see a clipper, and con-
gratulate him aceoi dingly.
Shooting.-On the first of the ensuing year
(Friday first) a purse of fifty guineas will be
shot for, by twenty members of the old shooting
ground.
Return -of H. M. S. Beagle -We extract
the retum of this vessel from a copy of the
Perth Gazette,, of the middle of October. ""This
surveying vessel returned to our port on the 28th
ultimo, she anchored under Rottnest Island on
tho 27th, and removed into Gage's Roads on
the 28th. Nothing of importance connected
with the survey of the New South Wales coast
has trabspired, further than that the survey on
the north and north west coast of New Holland
is now completed. The Beagle visited Timor,
but brings no later intelligence from the east ;
and no account of the fate of the Pelorus, which
vessel, it may be remembered, was driven on
shore at Port Essington. She also touched at
Sharks' Bay, where an ample supply of turtle
was obtained, at the intervening islands. Op-
posite Morseby's flat-topped range a good an-
chorage or harbour was discovered, but open to the north-west.""
Dinner to Glengarry.-Tt is with great
pleasure that we hear that a dinner to the
Chieftain of Glengarry will -sliorlfy come off.
Ii is to be conducted on a most magnificent scale,
and it is supposed will be the most splendid
uff.iir of tho kind which haj ever taken place
in Sydney. We'bave not as yet heard where
it is'to take place, nor what will be the charge
of the ticket for admission.
Robbery. On Friday Ia*t, while Mr. G.
Bennet, boot and shoo maker, George-street;
was absent at church, some person or persons
entered the shop and stole from I hence the
following articles, viz. : A Check on the Bank
of New South Wales, dated the 28th Decem-
ber, for £G5, drawn by Mr. Wyatt in favour of
Mr. Bennet. £2 8s. GJ. in cash ; 9 pairs of
Wellington boots, 8 pairs of Clarence boots,
and other articles. Mr. Bennet on discovering
his loss, posted in several parts of the town,
plackards, offering a reward of £5 for the apprt
hension of the party or parties. We have been
informed, that two or three persons were appre-
hended on Saturday night on suspicion of the
robbery.
Theatre -A riot took place in the Victoria
Theatre, on Saturday night, and was only
quelled aftei thirty-five of the parties had been
taken to tile watch-house. Sarve 'em right !
Geelong.-Our latest papers received from
Geelong are of the most uninteresting nature.
As"" regard news ihey seem to be much in the
same predicament with ourselves. We subjoin
the following trifles from our latest date.
GALLAGHER THE AUSTRALIAN POET.--We
have been favored by Mr. Lyle, Superintendent
of the House of Correction, with the following
lines, addressed to him by the above worthy
during his last visit to the treadmill, where he
has often been recommended by the Bench for
the benefit of his health. We lay the lines
before our readers, as they have at least the
merit of originality:--
My fate condimns me for tbe want of shoes,
A sad complaint that oft attends the muse;
And if that there be any for to spare,
Could I solicit or expect a pair?
For I from Sydney do intend to steer,
And cease from paying further visits here.
The roads are bad, and I can scarcely stand,
Or walk barefooted on the stones or sand;
To ask this favour I am further led,
As you have done a kindness to my head;
That other parts an equal share may meet,
I hope that you will not forget my feet:
And us I travel o'er each weary mile,
I will look back and pray for Mr. Lyle.
Oct. 31st, 1840. W. GALLAGHER.
News.-The Colonial news is very dull at
present, at this time of the year-such is inva-
riably the case. The Courts being all >hut, and
nothing of public importance tran-acling. We
are, therefore, necessitated'lo make up our news
of such extraéis from linglish and other jour
nais, U9 wo think most interesting.
Sale of Land. - Oh Thursday last was held
the land sale by Mr. Forster, which bad been
adjourned from the previous week. The sale
vrus well attended, and the land, which con-
sisted of three half avros in South Geelong,
went off at fair prices. One allotment at the
corner of Yarra and Fyans-st'reet, sevcntv-fve
feet routage anti sixty five deep, fetched £2 5-,
per (bot. The following is au abstract of the
result ol' the sale : -
Allotment Ii of Block 6. £460 0 0
Allotments 8 k 4 same block . . . . 365 9 0
Total. £830 0 0
Tns Blacks.-The outrages committed b^
these innocent children of nature are so fre-
quent that the scttleis are "" getting used to
them."" A tribe of blacks, las week, drove
sewulven sheep from Mr. Murston's station on
the Grampians, and had not the shepherds
shown a determined spirit, furlhir outrages
would have ensued.
Orders.-The order nuisance is at its fall
height in G. elong at prscut ; most of-our
money transactions are settled by orders of the
Melbourne bunks, which is exceedingly incon-
venient, and causes un apparent scarcity of
money when no such scarcity exists. The evil
¡3 increased by the fact, that if a twenty-pounds
order be tendered iu payment of a ten pound
debt, the balance is expected to be banded over
' in hard cash ! The establishment of a branch
bank cannot be delayed much longer.
1 The Constables' Nzw Stafi's.-The new
1 Bluffs which ibu Sydney constables received on
' Christmas day aro much shorter than those
' lately worn by that body. We beard two men
' talking on ihe t-ubject on Saiurday last, when
. one of them remarked, in the course of conver-
sation, that the new ones would give as hard a
blow, and be more difficult to be wrenched from
the hand than the other ones. "" Ob.lhroth !""
replied his neighbour, ""an ¡isthemselves can
give a hard blow sure enough, but by the powers
if I only had a good shiiielah in my hand, I'd
give two blows will) one twist of my fist. Och,
the shiiielah (hat can woik at boll) ends is ihe
thing for an Irishman!""
Musquitoes.-These nuisances are among
tho greatest plagues which at present infest
Sydney. Wo never knew them so numerous
ai they are at this pri scut season of the year.
The inhabitants in general, anti new comers in
particular, should subscribe together a handsome

At last he came to church to-day;
Six neighbors carried him that way;
But, when he passed the portals
straight,
Another had to swing the gate,
Another open wide the door,
For he could open it no more.
But now at last he came in search
Of something that they have in
church.
The preacher spoke a helpful word,
And yet I wonder if he heard,
Or, if he heard, he understood?
His hearing now was not so good.
He was made welcome, for all men
Are always welcome, even then;
And yet he would have been, I know,
As welcome years and years ago.
We all must go to church some day,
But some of us too long delay.
The words of comfort by our bier
We could have come in life to hear,
For here to greet us waits a Friend
At the beginning, not the end.
Religion is for living—aye,
To live by, not alone to die.

MINISTERIAL CHORUS--""NOTICE TO QUIT.""
""Notice to quit!""--""Notice to quit!""
Look on the walls what words are writ!
Up in the gallery--down on the floor,
Plainer than ever they showed before.
""Come down from your places"" the letters shine;
""Ye are weighed--ye are wanting--Resign, resign.""
In the people's eyes, upon every face
Glooms the dark shadow of our disgrace,
And the voice of a nation in angry roar
Wakes up like the sea on its fretted shore;
And the tempest thickens--outside--outside--
On the fury of winds our goblins ride;
In ominous hubbub they come--they grow--
Nearer--above us--around--below--
On yonder benches their figures seem
To muster like shapes of some hideous dream,
And lend to the conflict a fearful might,
Like gods that mingle in mortal fight.
Hotter and hotter does MARTIN wax,
Bruising our bones with his battle-axe;
Taller and taller does ARNOLD loom,
Shrivelling our flesh with his wild simoom;
And MURRAY the driver, with ox-goad fierce,
Plays at his terrible carte and tierce;
And COWPER pinches us black and blue,
And PIDDINGTON tightens his timber screw;
And over the table BOB CAMPBELL scowls,
And ROBERTSON blusters, and FORSTER growls,
And DALLEY scourges with lash polite,
And the RUSDENS help him with bark and bite,
And JONES the traitor--the cruel JONES
Taunts us for ever in bitterest tones,
Shifting about--to no party tied,
But he always hits hardest against our side.
How little for sawder he seems to care;
What a deal of that article's wasted there!
And NICHOLS is basely falling away,
And EGAN won't wink at the game we play,
And OXLEY has notions of independence,
And our friends have grown noted for slack attendance.
For ever, for ever the tumult swells--
We stand as a target for shots and shells.
Say, then, shall we yield to the warning voice,
And withdraw while withdrawal is left to choice?
For willing or not we must hence away,
The destinies order us not to stay.
There, on the walls is their sentence writ--
""Notice to quit--Notice to quit.""

Continually paragraphe appear in the papers '
stating that the water from some artesian bore
ja running io waste. A case in point is a report
from Moree, stating that the overflow from Dol
gelly Bore has caused a swamp on the public
road which had "" rendered heavy traille imipas
eable. Thousands of pounds of public money has
been spent in sinking artesian welle, with the
extraordinary result-that people complain of the
nuisance arising from too much water. Either
artesia-n water is a benefit to the ccnumunity in
which tho well is. situated or it is not. If it is
an advantage, the people who benefit should be
compelled to see that it is not wasted. If the Svell
was sunk for no other purpose than to demon
strate the presence of water in any given locality, .
and: tho water; is not used hy the conumunity,
then the well should be capped and, locked until
tho water is required. Probably the wells ought
to be .'capped any way, and no more water al
lowed to flow from them than is absolutely neces
sary to supply local ""wants. In some portions, of
America.a municipal ordnance demands that every
artesian well shall be furnished with a cap and 1
a lock, and no water permitted to run to waste,
under a penalty. We have heard much ci irri
gation problems in this, colony, and large sums
of money hare been spent on surveys and draw
ings outlining proposed, canals from ?"".intermittent
rivers, which under ordinary conditions could never,
bo made to pay. But in the case oí artesian wells,
where the watea* is suitable, the case is different,
for they supply* water in dry seasons as well as
in wet ones. Why, then, in the nairne of common
sense, cannot Irrigation settlements be started- in
con nection with these wells? As a'matter of fact,
it would seem as if nobody in the colony wanted
bo. irrigate. If there was really any demand by
bona-fide settlers for irrigable land, the areas now
lying idle around our artesian wells would be
eagerly ""selected for that purpose, and apparent

left to private entemprise, the public woiuld have

A. very pretty story tinder the title ""A Romance
ot the Peerage"" has heen going the rounds o£ the
Australian press. It is, briefly, to the effect that
a Mr. R. D. J. Fitzgerald, who has lately been em- ,
ployed as a gardener at Adelaide, has been in
fornied by .cable-that'an uncle who has just died
had left him a legacy of £300 a year, and also that
ho was ""heir-presumptive to the Barony, of De
Ros."" Other interesting information as to the
past career of the future peer is also given. Ac- '
custonied as Australians are to finí scions of the.
British aristocracy acting as roustabouts or loafing
in the Domain, there appears to be hut slight
foundation for the. latest story. The Barony of De
Ros, or De.Roos, as it was originally styled, is the
premier barony of England. It descends- from
Robert de Roos, a.grandson of another Robert,, who
was one of the twenity-flve barons ,who extorted
Mágna Charta from King John, and who was sum
moned to Parliament in 1264. v The barony was in
aheyance from the death, in 1687, of the profligate
Duke of Buckingham, until 1806v when it was»ter
minated in favor of Charlotte, daughter bf the Hon.
Rohert Boyle-""Walsingham, wife of Lord' Henry
FitzGerald, and grandmother of the present peer.
The Barony of D'? Ros descends to heirs general,
and the present ielr-apparent is the Hon. Mary
Francés, his only daughter, bongin 1854, and mar
ried in 1878 to the Hon. A. Ii. Dawson, son of the
Earl of j Dartrey. As there is issue of this mar
riage three daughters,, the. probability of the Ade
laide claimant succeeding to the title is somewhat
reinóte.
One half the world doen't know how the other
half travels. The writer has beer* led into this
philosophical reflection by that-item ef hews
flashed aerees the ocean the other day, that 400
emigrants had been poisoned on an Italian steamer
by verdigris from the cooking, utensils mixing
with the food. The way of the emigrant hos ever
been a hard, one, and it ts to be presumed will
always remain so while necessity compels people
of slender means to cross the ocean. - It makes
little difference, toe, whether the ship be Italian or
whether it be British. On some British ships
indeed emigrants, or what is much the same thing,
steerage passengers, fare worse than on many car
rying the ..flags of other nationalities. A few.
weeks ago a friend'of the writer's finding that
thing» were not going too well with him in Austra
lia, decided to return home. He was busy packing
when I called to say goodbye. Piled up on the
table were packets of ;tea and sugar, jars"" of jam,:
tins of condensed milk, sardines, preserved meats,
biscuits, essences, with ""a téa-pot and a host of
other little things. ""What are you going to do
with these?"" I asked. MWby, put them in my
trunk, of course."" VI thought the steamer found
you in everything?"" ""So it does in a sense if
you. care to take what's going;: but, you see, I am
profiting by the experience I gained on my voyage
out. ""A man never leaves himself dependent sole
ly on the ship's hospitality twice in succession.
There's no lack-of food you know-of a sort-but
it's plain, very plain, and almost invariably spoil
ed in the cooking. You see those little boxes
there, those ai-e pills, very useful things to a
steerage passenger."" ""You have surely enough
of them?"" I ventured. ""I think so. I hope so.
It's this way. We'll have sea-pie once a week,
and plain pudding twice a week. Sea-pie seldom
takes less than fifteen pills to dislodge it, hut in
the pudding the presence of the fruit stalks: re
duces the consistency somewhat, and ten pills
usually suffice. Twice ten plus fifteen and you
have 35, or about a box per week."" ""And these
things here?- You don't mean to say you re
quire them oh board?"" ""What! not insect pow
der? Not carbolic? Not candle?.Not pastiles?
My good fellow it is easily seen-hut I forget you
have never travelled 'tween decks. Pray Heaven
that n you never may."" I really pitied- my poor
friend. At the same time I could not but admire
his cheerfulness and his pluck.""' - The way of the
emigrant is Indeed a hard one.

An English, visitor, with something of insular
contempt for ""our institutions,"" told me the other
day that he miûlîked our system of Government
railways and tramways. It deprived us, he said
of the maAy benefits duo to competition. So I
carefully pointed out to him that the Ocean-street
cable tram had, by the purest competition, thrown
out of use a whole branch of the steam tram; ¿nd
that the new line about to be laid in Geórge-street
would compete severely, if not ruinously, with
the city sectioin of the older trams. . And h'e an
swered that these were the defects not the ad
vantages of competition! ' Which shows how use
less it is to< aigue against invincible prejudice.
Also, he ""wanted to know, you know,"" why the
existing' tramways stop short of Circular Quay,
losing meet of' the North Shore and Manly passen
gers to the omnibuses; and why there are no
penny fares ""between street-ends"" in the city. It
would have been impossible to explain all this
satisfactorily to a man of that kind, and I thought
it beet to change the eubject.

It requires' considerable courage in these highly
educated days, even on the part of, a Governor, to
confess to a total ignorance of music. Yet even
here the law of compensation helps to . bring the
balance even. The man who, as Chancellor Mac
Laurin scornfully quotes, ""is not moved with con
cord of sweet sounds,"" also escapes the agony
which is suffered by the sensitive ear under the
infliction of ""harsh discords ' and unpleasant
j sharps."" He does not dream of the homicidal im
'pulse ""which seizes upon the mildest of men under
the prolonged torture of, his neighbor's ill-used
j piano, or the shrill vocal gymnastics of his neigh
bor's accomplished daughter. He is blissfully un
conscious of the shriek that ""pierces the fearful
hollow"" of the musician's ear, the exasperating re
iteration of the same, passage with the ever-recur
rent false notes, the ""sweet bells jangled out of
tune,"" and all the harmonies gone mad which rack
the victim's quivering nerves-of all these, he reeks
nothing. No, in these days of thin walla and cheap
pianos, of incompetent teachers1 and ambitious stu
dents, happy is the man who has ""no ¿ar,"" and who
humbly but cheerfully admits that he ""doesn't
know one note of music from another.'

A device for obtaining from.common air a gas t
that will burn for lighting and heating purposes,
""by--.neutraiising the incombustible constituents,""
is, if anything, a shade more startling than the
Laputon project for extracting sunlight from cu
cumbers. For cucumbers do contain sunlight, in
a sense, but the air has never been credited with
containing fuel. Nitrogen won't burn, and oxygen,
though necessary to all burning, won't burn either;
and aa for the newly-discovered argon, it is as fire
proof a brickbat. So, but for the assurance
that the thing has been successfully tried in Syd
ney, one would be inclined to say that the air ""has
bubbles,, as the water 'hath, and this is of them,""

Professor Gosman, now visiting . Sydney, ls an
advócale of the fixing a ""minimum wage,"" as prac
tised in'Victoria. With most adrâirablo frank
ness ho admits that fixing a minimum wage does
not secure its being paid, ""because it cannot be,
unless there ls the work;"" but he considers it valu
able as a standard, and for its educative effect.
If it is thus intended only as a ""counsel of per
fection,"" there can be'no"" harnTin putting it pretty
high. A good big minimum wage in each trade
would form an interesting Item In the information
circulated for the use of emigrants, and would
, tend to attract an energetic and ambitious class
of men. And it would be little, if at all, more
delusive than some of the statements as to wages
and priées to be found in documents of tho kind.
The writer of this note is entirely in sympathy
with Professor Gosman's idea, and means to ""ant
upon it by suggesting to the editor that he he re
munerated at a minimum rate of five guineas a
.line. If it is explained that this amount need
not be actually paid, he does hot see why any
objectitm should foe made to the proposal.

With tho landing in-Sydney last week, of tho
contingent of Pennanent Artilleryman and Sub
marine Miners was witnessed the return of tho
last of those of our troops who participated in
the glory, pomp, and circumstance of the Record
Reign celebrations. They followed hard upon
the heels of the Mounted Rifles. Both the latter
and thé Lancers, who had come back some week*,
before, had got the heartiest of receptions from
the public, as well as from their comrades-in
.arms. And, as if to show that neither civilians
nor military were getting tired of offering thsee
demonstrations, the enthusiasm of the ""welcome
home, boys!"" was not a whit less pronounced
for the Artillerymen and Miners than for the
troops that had come fresh from their Jubileo
triumphs. Nor was the warmth of the welcome
in any way associated with the much deprecated
""military spirit."" There was a special reason*
behind it which was alike creditable to those
who gave the welcome and those who received it.'
A not altogether unfounded impression had got
abroad that the- Artillerymen and Miners, if not
exactly the Cinderellas of the family in the late
Royal commemorations, had somehow teen kept
as far'as possible from the ""front"" when the fun
was going on; though it is now well., enough
known that they ? actually put in more realty
sound and serviceable work than if they had
been attending afternoon- tea parties or Tubbing
shoulders with Royalty and the peerage all the
time. The Major-General"", in welcoming the
men back, made mention of the fact* that they
had not been as well advertised as the-other
cbmpauies; ""but,"" said he, ""they had done good,
solid work,"" which was what they were sent
for. This was perfectly true. Did a Lancer
cleave a ""Turk's head,"" or cut a lemon in two,
or did one of our crack shots make a bull's-eye
at'Aldershot,' the fact was far better known
throughout New South -Wales, and, indeed, over_
all Australia, than if Moore Park or Randwick
had been the scene. Whereas, beyond the cir
cumstance that on one occasion Captain Dangar,
Captain Cansdell, Lieutenánt Lamb, and their
brother officers had been presented to the August
,-Lady whose reign we were all rejoicing over, we
heard nothing by cable of the doings of the
Artillerymen and the Submarine Miners. Tho
truth is they were more usefully employed than
being merely out for the show. After the first
month, which they spent in Chelsea Barracks,
the Field Artillery went into solid training at
Aldershot, the Garrison Artillery were taken to
the Isle of Wight, and the Submarine Miners
were quartered at Portsmouth. So that, though
they may háve-missed most of the glarñor of the
Jubilee, they-assuredly did not miss the more
solid advantages of a course of instruction in tho
best military schools in the kingdom.-A. .

The conversazione given last week by>Mr. Harry
S. Levy to introduce to the Sydney social and
musical world Messrs. Aitken and Lee-Williams
once more accentuates the deplorable poverty of
our mother tongue. It ls a little hard to have to
travel to Italian sources for a word to. describe the
most primitive form of entertainment. Even be
fore the days of Jubal (the Pandora of'mueic), man
kind doubtless met in a friendly way to dissect
(metaphorically and otherwise) their nearest ^neigh
bor, and the custom shows no sign of becoming ob
solete. . The^ woman (it must have been one) who
hit upon ithe terni ""at home"" showed an extraor
dinarily fertile- imagination, 'for it is the boast of
the Briton that the frivolous ^Frenchman has nb
equivalent, verbal or actual, for the term. Yet
for the orthodox ""at home"" some form of amuse
ment seems to be imperative, and the moat brilliant
talker is silenced by bhe ubiquitous musician or
the irrépressible reciter. The truth is that, sc
far from regarding conversation as one of the fine
arts, it is* hardly reckoned with even as a form of
amusement, and, like letter writing,-which was a
serious .study in the days of our grandmothers, the
science of apt and eloquent expression is woefully
neglected. Perhaps this accounts for our having
absolutely no Saxon word to describe a ""conver
sazione;"" even the word ""Parliament,"" borrowed
from the French, is strictly confined to regions
where talking has a financial value. The Germans
have a delightful * and characteristically onomato
poeic word ""Kaffee-ldaitsch,"" which hardly needs
translating into its equivalent ""coffee chatter,"" but
till conversation is recognised as a legitimate form
.of entertainment, and studied with the seriousness

terms for a fitting form of expression.--J.
Tho decision of the Full Court in the case of .
Baker v. Love, holding that the Corporation of'the
City of Sydney ;was entitled to prohibit hawking
in the city even by persons holding a hawker's >
licence for the whole colony, unless they held a !
licence from the council, may have-serious conse
quences. If.it is, as ""the, Full Court says it -Is,
legal for the City Council to make such a bylaw,
and impose,a licence fee"", what is to prevent the
other 181 boroughs or municipalities of the colony
from doing.'the "" same? True, "" the corporation
claims the powers under the Sydney Corporation
Act; but a not very wide reading of tire. 153rd sec
tion of the Municipalities Act would give like
power to the other municipalities. Some of them
doubtless will be glad of an opportunity to increase
their revenues, and eagerly seize it.; It certainly,
seems somewhat of an anomaly 'that when the*
Crown has granted a person a licence to hawk""all>L
over the colony"" a municipality should be able to
step in and say, ""You shall not do so unless y'oup
pay us a fee likewise."" Again, it .will ""be inter
esting to know if when the city corporation grants
a licence for its district the Crown can step in and
demánd the ordinary hawkers' fee also.TrU.:.
In the Australian Commonwealth of the future, ;
Queensland is to do all the talking, all the think

Ding away. .Without (Queensland Australia would ;
have neither head, arms, nor legs. This remark
able assertion is made in the ""Review of Reviews,""
and perhaps may he attributed to the pen of its
Australasian editor. Only he does no't state it in this
clumsy way. Hè puts it'with all the concinnity of :

There was a .sham fight-duly cut and dried-in
Sydney on Saturday. The trouble about a shana
fight is the enormous size of ' the sham and. tko
microscopical dimensions of the fight. Real war
is getting harder and harder., to parody, and there
is a great deal of difference of opinion among gen
tlemen learned in military lore as to what the next
instalment of international homicide will be like.
We can thank our lucky stars.that our mimic battle
was not conducted on the lines of the recent sham
fight in Germany, virhere nine men and fourteen, _
horses were wounded-and that too in a display .
which the experts declare to be, in the light ot
modern armaments, merely a huge farce. Ouu. >
local sham fight may give us a pleasant sense of
security. The citizen may rest undisturbed by¡ ;.
the fear of Woolloomooloo falling into 'hostile
hands, or an arrogant foe dictating terms of peace -'
from Pinchgut. But:
When the enemy comes ;
With hie banners and drums, , . ! :, . .f i
And plans to relieve us of guinea and geri?,
With his patent fascines, '
A«d his murder machines,
All eager to send us to heaven or-hem I . : ¡sr

That will surely upset _t
And. change foi? the better his bellicose capersy ??;
If the militant gent * ' ' ""-.
Will only consent - '
To tell us he's coming In all of the i>apers. "" ? .
If he comes In the day ' ?
With his bands in full play, ' . ;» J. .?

could wish it ""founded more on the lines of the Bri- -
tish Constitution."" . And in view of the political ,
""notions"" threatened to'be imported hither from
the land of wooden clocks or from that of wooden
nutmegs, one may welcome the saying as a (reason

difficult to ""follow, especially in a country which
has no House cf Lords to ""thank Heaven"" for,- and '

In Russell Court, against the Cannon Ball,
At sign of Surgeon's Arms be sure to call;
For there you'll find a doctor lately come,
Who tired of roaming means to stop at home.
He's practised surgery and physio both,
And for fresh oures (of coarse) is nothing loth.
Bat if he should by ohanoe the patient kill
•Tis not the doctor's fault but heaven's will.
In dropsy, scurry, fits, bo knows enough,
Or—if you like some Latin— quantum $nf.

To 000 l the hottest blood in half an hour.

THROUGH thc night air stillness stealing,
Mournfully the bell is pealing
Mournfully and slow.
Peace it brings to the departed, .
Freedom to the broken hearted,
Best from earthly woe.
Bell! What terror is't thou bringest,
: As so solemnly thou ringest
Through the evening gloom ?
Wherefore doth thy sound appall us.
Fear we thou wilt quickly call us
To uncertain doom ?
Wherefore do we pause and tremble,
Wherefore fearfully assemble
In the stilly night ?
Do our own hearts thus affright us,
Have we no bright hope to light us,
Is not God our might ?
She, tho weary, sorrow laden,
She, the loved, the pure fair maiden ;
She for whom you toll.
Left us, weary of earth's sadness,
Looking forward to the gladness
Of a ransomed sou].
Bell ! toll on in mournful numbers,
Toll to wake us from our slumbers,
Slumbers deep and dread.
Warn us by thy plaintive wailing.

By Henry Kendall.
The rain-clouds have gone to the deep -
The East like a furnance doth glow ;
And the Day-spring in flooding the steep,
And sheening the landscape below!
Oh ! ye who are gifted with souls
That delight in the music of birds,
Come forth where the scattered mist rolls,
And listen to eloquent words! --
Oh! ye who are fond of the sport,
And would travel yon wilderness through,
Gather each to his place - for a life-stirring chase
In the wake of the wild kangaroo!
Gather - each to his place -
For a life-stirring chase
In the wake of the wild kangaroo!
Beyond the wide rents of the fog,
The trees are illumm'd with gold ,
And the bark of the shepherd's brave dog
Shoots away from the sheltering fold!
Down the depths of yon rock-border'd glade,
A torrent goes foaming along;
While the blind owls retire into shade,
And the ""echu""* beginneth its song.
By the side at that yawning abyss
Where the vapours are hurrying to,
We will merrily pass, looking down to the grass
For the tracks of the wild kangaroo!
We will merrily pass,
Looking down to the grass,
For the tracks of the wild kangaroo.
Ho! brothers, away to the woods!
Euroka+ hath clamber'd the hill;
But the morning there seldom intrudes,
Where the night shadows slumber on still!
We will roam o'er these forest-land's wild,
And thread the dark masses of vines,
Where the winds, like the a voice of a child,
Are singing aloft in the pines!
We must keep down the glee of our hounds --
We must steal through the glittering dew;
And the breezes shall sleep, as we cautiously creep
To the haunts of the wild kangaroo!
And the breezes shall sleep,
As we cautiously creep
To the haunts of the wild kangaroo!
When we pass thro' a stillness like Death,
The swamp-fowl and timorous quail,
Like the leaves in a hurricane's breath,
Will start from their nests in the vale.
And the forester#, snuffing the air,
Will bound from his covert so dark,
While we follow along in the rear,
As arrows speed on to their mark !
Then the swift hounds shall bring him to bay,
And we'll send forth a hearty halloo;
As we gather them all, to be in at the fall --
At the death of the wild kangaroo!
As we gather them all,
To be in at the fall --
At the death of the wild kangaroo!

In bloom renew'd, each plant and flower;
Let joy each latent care beguile,
To grace dear SARAH'S natal hour!
Successive years, well pleased, have seen
The lisping babe, the artless child,

But truth pourtray (as meet it should)
The merits of this favorite maid,
Mild, tender, amiable, and good.

The index of the heart we find;
In her that index well defines,
Sense, and intelligence of mind.
Nor less a temper prompt to please,
A heart, with tenderest feelings warm;
And (tho' inferior far to these)
Enshrin'd within a lovely form!
O! may the future years that glide,
View her in grace, and worth improved;
Her parents' comfort, and their pride,
Lov'd--and deserving to be lov'd!
Calm and serene may seasons roll;
And, as this festive day recurs,
May ripening virtues grace her soul,
And may increasing bliss be her's!
May she adorn her destined sphere,
Where may earth's* choicest blessings blend;
And still deserve, each circling year,
Th' esteem and praises of her friend!

A LL the fever, all the passion; stirs no
longer in my blood,
Which summer at its maddest swept o'er
me like a flood.
Theres a melancholy sweetness in these
chilly Autumn days,
Spite the gracious golden glory of the
wattles all ablaze;
Spite the clear, breath-taking beauty of
soft skies, delphinium blue,
Where the clouds are veils of gossamer
with rich sunlight flooding through.
The bush fires on Mt. Coot-tha are like
sentry fires at night,
And the moonlight has no softness,
crystal-dear and diamond-bright
Brisbane sits, a proud young city, on her
seven hills like Rome,
And in this enchanted weather calls her
truant children home.
And they come to share the magic of
her air like tonic wine,
And she spreads a glowing canvas where
barbaric colours shine.
Rich bignonia venusta weaves a living
tapestry,
And the spendthrift sun at noonday bids
the winds of winter flee.
See, the rebel bold poinsettia sounds her
loud defiance here,
Crying ""While my flag is flying Winter
never shall come near!""
While the gorgeous bougainvillea waves
beribboned arms around
Stately palms and ragged fences till the
city's crimson-gowned.
What a regal feast of splendour set for
folk of everyday!
Earth revives Spring's rainbow colours
though the Spring is far away.
So in Life's half-wistful Autumn, when
Youth's sparkling tale is told,
May we wake some inward radiance —
and grow lovelier, growing old.

White mist on the trees!

ONE OF AUSTRALIAN MANY HEROINES.

""Are there not modern Heroines of peace as well
as ancient Heroines of war?""—CARLYLE.
Brave were the Spartan mothers, who could stand,
Prepared for Sparta their own blood to shed;
Ana give to thoso thoy loved that Btern command—
""Baok with your shields or borne upon them dead.""
Not lera heroic thou of whom I sing,
Not less thy triumph in Life's battlefield;
And now tbo Fates with kindly sorrow bring
Tbeo home, fair Heroine, on thy snow-white shield.
In Meero's lake the Lotus Naiad grew
Blue lilies from Nyeera's sacred seed
As burial wreaths for thoso tho angels knew
Immaculately pare in word and deed.
Worn, weary soul, the Naiad calls thy name,
And in thy white hand softly bjds tbee take
The last sweet proof of thine unsullied fame,
Blue lilies from tho Meeroanian lake.

Farewell, Nymboi River!
[WRITTEN FOR THE QUEENSLANDER.]
J.A. STUART.
Dawson River, 1888.
There comes to me across the years
The faint sweet memory of a day
When, with regretful bitter tears,
From Nymboi stream I turned away,
And onward went against my will,
Bore weary with the dust and beat,
And longing much to linger still,
In Nymboi's depths to lave my feet.
I longed to linger there beneath
The leaning beantree's tempting shade,
To loll at ease and softly breathe
The music that her murmurs made.
But Fate had bade me move along ;
So onward, at a dreary pace,
I went, sweet streamlet of my song !
With aching heart and doleful face.
Then, toiling up the flinty track,
I paused upon the wind-blown rise;
Dear Nymboi ! looking fondly back,
A foolish mist was in my eyes.
Had I my wish, oh tuneful spring !
Beside thee would I tarry long,
And, when thy hill-born waters sing,
Would pen perchance a pensive song.
But wearily I wander forth—
A dull home-sickness in my soul—
Just facing, at haphazard, north
To some indefinite shadowy goal. * * * * * * *
And here at noon, where shade is scant,
The stifling gidya-scrub among,
For one cool draught from thee I pant,
Thou streamlet of my dreams and song!
Here longing (by the streamless creeks
Scorched by the torrid Queensland sun)
For where, round base of lofty peaks,
Thy waters, Nymboi, gently run.
Perhaps, when by some sun-dried bole,
O'er my poor carcass eagles scream,
Obeying Life's great wish, my soul
May hover still near Nymboi stream.",The Queenslander ,"861,482,688,670,208,839,590,549,553,613,564,582,534,594,528,653,543,597,586,470,594,596,532,594,588,500,571,516,601,626,481,574,534,665,660,521,642,661,643,660,617,539,645,599,572,613",Sat 16 Aug 1890,"272,567,687,773,2317,2342,849,876,910,942,981,1008,1043,1074,1131,1161,1197,1227,1265,1298,1326,1362,1419,1449,1482,1515,1553,1583,1617,1652,1707,1739,1773,1806,1883,1918,1951,1983,2016,2046,2082,2117,2169,2205,2238,2266","406,605,499,512,1047,416,498,526,498,526,496,526,496,526,496,528,496,528,496,528,496,535,496,524,496,526,496,524,496,528,496,524,496,524,496,528,496,528,496,528,496,528,496,526,496,526",20285316,Page 305

They tell you how to lay your plan,
And how to carry it through.
They help the man, who's done what he can.
To bear his Waterloo.
Ton shall give the foeman all his due,
And let him win if he can;
But keep all right that belong to you.
For that is the law of man.
You shall hold the ground that is yours by right,
And yield not a foot you have trod.
But grant his right in a stand-up fight,
For that is the law of God.
If you row with the crew in the boat,
It's a wretched thing to spy.
There's plenty of work when you leave the float,
But little to do for the eye.
v There's plenty to do to swing and slide,
And steady the fragile shell,
But to gain your strength from the other side
Is a method sent from hell.
No man shall yield on the football field
Till the final whistle sounds.
No man shall show by a Bingle blow
That he has nd place on the grounds.
But when the"" foe is in racking pain
And cannot move cr fight,
You shall help him up to his feet again,
And chafe his bruise and bind his strain,
To show the make of your own good grain, .
For that is fair and right.
The strength of the team, or nine, or crew
Is not the strength of the ""star.""
'Tis what the body together can do
That carries the vic""t\ry far.
So you shall give your mite to th3 rest
To bring the whole team through,
And then at the time of your single test
They shall give theil strength to you.
And these are the laws of the athlete.
You can heed them or not, as you like,
But they make the code of the runner fleet,
And they check a man when he'd strike.
They tell you how to lay your plan,
And how to carry it through.
They help the man, who's done what he can,
To bear his Waterloo.",Australian Town and Country Journal ,"503,774,576,785,981,840,741,736,607,937,442,781,561,789,555,1036,699,802,547,758,574,997,572,848,596,946,552,799,566,753,764,747,555,824,854,923,532,884,691,714,568,760,693,836,744,766,822,882,813,724,612,916,452",Sat 13 Jun 1896,"3799,3868,3903,3936,3968,4002,4035,4068,4101,4135,4168,4234,4268,4301,4335,4368,4402,4435,4468,4534,4568,4602,4635,4668,4702,4735,4768,4834,4868,4901,4933,4967,5001,5034,5068,5101,5134,5200,5234,5267,5297,5333,5367,5400,5433,5499,5533,5566,5598,5631,5665,5698,5731","1777,1490,1753,1526,1560,1526,1558,1524,1559,1527,1558,1525,1560,1526,1560,1525,1558,1526,1558,1522,1558,1524,1559,1482,1559,1524,1556,1523,1558,1523,1560,1523,1559,1524,1525,1522,1556,1524,1557,1525,1557,1524,1558,1524,1556,1522,1558,1522,1557,1522,1556,1523,1557",71246819,Page 11

I PUaroSED onco to tako my pon and write,

With passion, but a cunning harmony
Of words and music caught from crien and height,

And shining places whoro tho sea streams lie ;
But this was when tho heat of youth glowed white.
And since I've put tho faded purposo by,
I have no faultless fruits to offer you
Who read my lays; but oertain syllables
Therein aro borrowed from unfooted dolls,
And secret hollows dear to noontide dew ;
And these at least, though far bctweon and few,
May catch tho sense like subtle forest spells.
So tako thom kindly, oven though thoro bo
Somo notes that unto othor lyres bolong:
Stray cohoes from tho older sons of song j
And think how from its neighbouring, native sea
Tho peusivo sholl doth borrow melody.
I would not do tho lordly-masters wrong,
By filching fair words from the shining throng
Whoso musio haunts mo, as tho wind-a troo !
Lo, when a stranger, in soft Syria's glooms
Shot through with sunset, treads tho cedar dolls ;
And hears tho breezy ring of elfin bolls
Far down by whore tho white haired cataraot

And early seek their rest ;

And birds with their own feathers
Are content ; er if they're daws.
In peacocks' plumes, they're stripped of them,
With general applause.
And birds who cannot sing
Don't insist on being heard,
Here, it's quite another thing.

""So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole.""
Friends, do ye think, thus far apart--
That, still to home-land feeling true,
The faithful magnet of my heart
Its trembling Index turns to you?
Friends, think you oft, what mem'ries press?
Thick coming thoughts that erst had power
With Sardius tints each hour to bless,
Circling thy minstrel in her bower!
Say, do you think--in days of yore,
What happy influences bound
Our day dreams, by Port Stewart shore,
And on ""the Causeway's"" classic ground?
Rosstrevor--Carlingford--Killowen--
Proud Down! and Antrim's silvery coast,
Alas! my world hath changed its zone:
Even dear familiar stars are lost.
Bright VEGA, here no sweetness sends;
But fairest of Night's gorgeous train,
The SOUTHERN-CROSS, above me bends,
Pointing my Northward course--in vain.
Could you but think what tears are wept!
For Christian voice--or hallowed fane--
Throughout the hundred Sabbaths, kept--
On lonely rock, and silent plain!
What longings for that old Church-bell,
'Till o'er-strained thoughts the heart beguile,
And on my ear its tollings swell,
As though I trod the sacred aisle.
Here Nature's bounties largely flow,
Her fairest treasures crown our care;
But oh! what aching void may grow
'Mid blessings it were bliss to share.
Then think, my friends, when poet's strain
Sings of the vine, and orange grove;
That one, beyond the Southern Main,
Looks back to Ireland's links of love.

! On ! the snow, the beautiful snow,
Filling the sky and earth below.
Over the housetops, over the street,
Over the heads nf the people you meet ;
Dancing-Flirting- Skimming along.
Beautiful suow ! it can do no wrong ;
Flying to kiss a fair lady's cheek,
Clinging to lips in frolicsome freak;
Beautiful snow from heaven above,
Pure aB an angel, gentle as love !
Oh ! the snow, the beautiful snow,
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go,
Whirling about in maddening fun ;
Chasing - Laughing-Hurrying by,
It lights on the face, and sparkles the eye
And the dogs with a bark and a bound
Snap at the crystals as they eddy around ;
The town is alive, and its heart in a glow,
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow
How the wild crowd goes swaying along,
Hailing each other with humour and song :
How the gay sleighs like meteors flash by,
Bright for the nrunent th^n lost to the eye ;
Binging-Swinging-Dashing they go
Over the crust of the beautiful snow ;
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,
To be trampled and tracked by thousands of feet,
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street.
Once I was pure aB the snow, but I fell,
Fell like the snow flakes from heaven to hell;
Fell to be trampled an filth in the street,
Fell to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat ;
Pleading-Cursing-Dreading to die,
Selling my soul to whoever would buy ;
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,
Hating the living and fearing the dead.
Merciful God, have I fallen so low ?
And yet I was once like the beautiful snow.
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,
With an eye like a crystal, a heart like its glow
Once I was loved for my innocent grace
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face
Fathers-Mothers-listers, all,
God and myself I havsj lost by my foll :
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by
Will make a wide sweep lest I wander too nigh ;
For all that is on or above me I know,
There is nothing so pure as the beautiful snow.
How Btrange it should be that this beautiful snow
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go !
How strange it should be when the night comes again,
If the snow and the ice struck mv desperate brain,
Fainting-Freezing-Dying alone,
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for a moan
To be heard in the streets of the crazy town,
Gone mad in the joy of snow coming down ;
To be and to die in my terrible woe,
With a bed and a shroud of the.beautiful snow.
HelplesB and foul as the trampled snow,
Sinner, despair not ! Christ stoopeth low
To rescue the soul that is lost in sin,
And raise it to life and enjoyment again.
Groaning-Bleedjng-Dying for thee,
The Crucified hung on the cursed tree !
His accents of mercy fell soft on thine ear,
"" Is there mercy for me ? Will he heed my weak prayer ?""
O God ! in the stream that for sinners did flow,
Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.",Australian Town and Country Journal ,"562,707,640,712,791,748,738,660,720,702,651,688,878,700,698,834,766,839,833,830,812,859,842,881,756,752,812,989,995,788,911,813,826,745,783,789,792,713,875,758,953,794,953,621,784,829,964,764,941,1000,876,1091,1016,684,868,890,874,725,949,800,814,733,811,753,780,849,1117,947,854",Sat 31 Mar 1877,"454,569,632,676,719,761,805,847,889,933,976,1067,1108,1154,1194,1238,1281,1322,1367,1411,1501,1544,1586,1629,1674,1719,1759,1798,1844,1936,1977,2024,2066,2108,2153,2195,2238,2282,2324,2418,2457,2505,2544,2590,2632,2674,2715,2763,2804,2894,2938,2978,3022,3069,3112,3154,3197,3243,3284,3375,3419,3464,3505,3548,3592,3634,3673,3719,3763","3957,3672,3685,3687,3686,3771,3684,3683,3686,3681,3680,3682,3682,3683,3769,3679,3680,3680,3681,3680,3679,3679,3680,3678,3765,3678,3677,3678,3678,3677,3678,3679,3678,3763,3677,3679,3679,3678,3679,3680,3679,3680,3680,3766,3680,3679,3683,3680,3680,3681,3682,3680,3680,3764,3683,3679,3680,3679,3681,3680,3680,3679,3680,3766,3681,3683,3681,3681,3681",70600136,Page 24

(A FRAGMENT.)
A splendid Sun betwixt the trees -
ling spikes of flame did shoot ;
When turning to the fragrunt South,
With longing eyes and, burning mouth,
I stretched a bond athwart the drouth,
' And plnckt at cooling fruit.
So thirst was quenched, and hastening os,
With strength returned to me,
I set my face against the Noon,
And reached a denser forest soon,
Which dipped into a still lagoon,
Hard by the Booming sea.
All d»y tba Oca» n beat on bar.
And bank of gleaming sand :
Yet that lone pool was always mild
It never moved when waves were wild,
But slumbered, like a quiet child,
Upon tbe lap of Lind.
And when I rested by the brink,
Amongst the fallen flowers,
I lay in calm ; no leaves were stirrod
By breath of wind, or wing of bird ;
It was so still, you might have heard
The footfalls of the hours.
Faint, slumbrous scents of roses Tilled
The air which covered me.
My words were low-"" She loved them to ;
In Fden vales such odours blotr ¡
How strange it is that roses grow
So near the shores of Sea !""
A sweeter fragrance never came
Across the neills of yore I
And when 1 said "" we here wonld dwell,]""
A low voioe on the silence fell -
'* Ah ! if yon loved the roses well,
You loved Ailoon the more. ""
.""Ay, that I did, and now would turn.
And fall, and worship her.'
But ob, yon dwell BO far- so high !
One cannot reach, though he may try,
The Morning hud. aud Jasper sky
The radiant hills of Myrrh.""
"" Why ver. me with delicious hints
Of fairest face, and rarest blooms ;
You Spirit of a darling Dream
Which links itself with every theme
Aid thought of mine by surf or st-cim,
Ia glens, or caverned glooms?""
She said "" Your wishes led me down
From amaranthine bowers :
And since my face was haunting thee.
With roses, dear, whioh ur ed to be
They all have hither followed me,
The (cents and shanes of flowers.""
"" Then stay, mine own evangel) stay.
Or, going, take me too ;
Bat te t me sojourn by your side,
If here we dwell or there abide,
It matters not !"" I madly cried,
"" I only care for you.*'.
O glittering form that wonld not stay !
0 sudden, sighing breeze !
A fainting rainbow dropped below
Far gleaming Peaks and walls of snow :
And there, a weory way, Tgo,
Toward the Sunrise Seas. _

The Power of Woman's Love.
CHRISTOPHUS.
OH, Woman! couldst thou estimate the power
By Heaven bestowed upon thy natal hour,
For good or ill—
The power to soothe our suffering and distress,
Or drive us to despair and bitterness,
Or further still-
Didst thou but know how one short word from
thee
A Heaven of bliss or hell of misery
Can in man's breast create-
Thou wouldst more wisely use a power so great,
And thus redeem us ere it is too late.
And who shall say that woman's influence sweet
Is powerless great emergencies to meet ?
A thing of nought—
That, 'neath its sway, no fallen man may be
From loathsome vice or hardoned villainy
To virtue brought?
Redeemed by woman's love, and kindly ways.
To pause, and turn, and think of other days.
He lies who says it. Deeply, doubly, lies.
He lies (ignorance deeming himself wise);
He knows not woman's power.
It hath a strength so holy, pure, and true
It cannot fail, whate'er it strives to do.
And in the darkest hour
It shines a beacon bright, illumining
A gloomy world of selfishness and sin.
I swear again, he lies. Mortal are all.
Were all men. since that first disastrous fall,
Wrought by a woman's hand.
And now with holy love she strives to make
Some reparation for a past mistake
And thro' the land
We see them, ministering angels, go
Assuaging sorrow and relieving woe.
Mortal were all. Mortal are all men now,
For, when th' Almighty first upon man's brow
His image stamped,
He fashioned all alike, with kindred fears
And hopes, ambitions, loves, growing with man-
hood's years.
We all are camped,
A mighty army, on a sunken plain,
But he who strives the topmost heights may gain.
There is no man so lost in vice and sin
But there exists a chink his armour in,
P'raps in its strongest part.
There is no man whose guiding star has waned
But has some feeble ray of good retained,
Deep buried in his heart.
Once strike the keynote to the mystery,
What follows then shall prove my prophecy.
And, quickened by the power of woman's love,
The meanest wretch shall raise himself above
Such misery.
And tho' a fall hath nevcr been so low,
And tho' his follies no restriction know,
He still shall be
Dragged from the mire of sins, which but increase
To honour, virtue, honesty—and peace.",The Queenslander ,"857,493,786,268,849,773,272,850,677,302,904,79,635,496,874,672,894,738,359,805,766,343,841,802,748,766,559,753,703,441,672,686,694,804,537,806,651,334,667,677,770,829,359,759,883,230,351,639,905,696,707,491,861,757,451,718,803,855,839,234,703,719,286,905,714",Sat 6 Oct 1883,"422,663,784,3074,863,893,928,961,1006,1030,1063,1096,1131,1167,1198,1233,1290,1323,1357,1391,1424,1460,1493,1526,1581,1616,1646,1682,1717,1751,1784,1814,1872,1907,1942,1975,2009,2044,2076,2112,2167,2202,2236,2268,2302,2337,2372,2403,2438,2493,2528,2562,2595,2630,2665,2698,2731,2789,2822,2857,2890,2924,2957,2991,3024","461,636,477,1024,420,420,521,420,420,523,420,454,420,521,419,419,420,419,523,420,420,521,422,420,420,422,521,420,420,521,420,420,419,428,524,419,420,521,419,419,419,419,521,419,419,452,523,419,419,419,419,518,419,419,518,419,419,419,419,521,419,419,521,419,420",19793832,Page 553

looking billy-goat in possession of an

something that looked like open hos-
tility. He had the long, beard and .
""battered appearance ' of a pioneer, bat
I was not going to allow myself' to
be betrayed into making jany advances
on- that account, and when he reared
himself on his hind legs a second time

I Ifefc Him have a hunk of diorite the
size- of a half-brick; in the ribs, and
he rolled down the other side <A the
heáp to think ¡the matter-over.
Presently I heard the familiar rattle
of-a .shaker, and bore down on my
quarry to 'find out what year the ope-
rator was branded. And here fist lt
be said that 'every one' of the names
included in this /screed is i that of some ;

part of """"the State-sturdy, sèlf-reliant. '?

. I -was. not long in ingratiating my-
self ¿with Tom Bentley, who, with his
mata, arrived at Gnarlbine Soak just '
as Beidy was taking away the last
half-load of water from it at the time
of rtfae big Coolgardie drought. (This
is the «same Beidy who was lately con-
victed of - vagrancy, - but was then
known as one of the luckiest and most
open-handed of all, ""the put-back pros- i
pectors of the day, though it* is ad- ¡
Butted that' ¡his-success> in ""finding '
Kurnalpi, etc;,, was chiefly due to the
assistance :pf- the-niggers^ with whom
he was always oh good terms).
¡Bentley-claims - to.!have followed very

didn't dolly up io expectations. Upon

And Stockmen whistle and shout.
Old draughting gates creak to and fro'
As the Overseer ""culls"" out.
It's ""Block 'Em!"" here, and ""Open!"" there
Till the final muster's made
Of some of the finest stock that's bound
For the Bowen Park parade!
'THERE are horns to polish and hoofs to trim
And sleek, warm coats to brush.
And a score of elusive, swishing tails
To ""bang"" in the dipping ""crush"".
There are loads of fodder to bale and rail
And the thoroughbreds to shoe.
And in case the* weather should prove unkind
There's rugging to think of, too!
•^HERE'S the riding gear to soften and shine,
And there must be no delay
- In running the road mounts in—their Mountain

For the drovers are due for the sunset trail
In the wake of the mulgas' shade.
And it's little they'll care- for sleepless nights
En route to the Grand Parade!
be lilting laughter and care-free joy
For some at the journey's end!
While back where the hills sweep down to the plains
Are others with work to tend.
There'll be friends of old who will gladly meet
And many a new one made.
When the Condamine greets the Central-West
At the coming Grand Parade!
BRUCE QUARTERMAINE
Spahlinger Vaccine
Experiments with the Spahlinger
vaccine for tuberculosis are being/jtr
ried out in Ireland, as well as in J^>
land. The Ulster Minister for Agri
culture (Sir Basil Brooke), in moving
the"" minutes of liis department in the
Northern Ireland Parliament recently,
said that the vaccine had conferred a
high degree of immunity against a
lethal dose of tubercle injected into the
blood stream, and at least an equally
high degree of immunity against in
tense natural infection during a period
of approximately two years. Such
highly satisfactory results raised the
question of the compulsory use of the
vaccine as a means of eradicating
tuberculosis from Ulster herds. As a
first step towards that object it was
desirable to clear up two points, and
these would be the subject of further
experiments. One of these had already
started, and the other would start a_s
soon as Mr. Spahlinger could provide
a further supply of vaccine.

I stood in the Temple of Silence
Where in crimson splendour shone
The rich light through stained windows
O'er a matchless crystal throne.
And a vista of stately pillars
Stretched far 'neath a dome of gold,
And sculptured recumbent figures
Of mortals of kingly mould.
Yet with all its surpassing beauty
I could feel the icy breath
Of the wings of some brooding phantom
In this gilded house of death.
Here no sound ever broke the stillness,
Here solitude e'er abode,
I stayed till the moonbeams quivered,
Then left Silence alone with God.
I stood in the Palace of pleasure,
The revels were wild and gay,
And mocking laughter rose and fell
As the swift hours sped away.
The lights waxed dim, and the flowers
Drooped dead in the gorgeous bowls,
And the pitited faces anon grew sad
And mirthless their empty souls.
The long night waned, and the dancers,
Their beauty all faded and worn,
Looked pallid, and listless, and weary,
In the rays of the glorious morn.
Ever seeking ephemeral pleasure,
Which leads to the pith of pain,
And down to the Valley of Never,
Whence none may return again.
I stood in Life's garden of beauty,
And, lo : in a floral shrine
Of roses and lilies entwining
Lay a chalice of dew Divine.
And a throng of mortals stood waiting
For the Angel of Love to pour
This holy dew of libation,
Which falleth for evermore.
And children were weaving garlands
As they walked o'er the verdant sward
With the flowers of Truth and Perfection
In sunlight which ever poured.
And here, in this new earthly Eden,
With its gleaming wings of white,
Was Peace, for all men were Brothers-
I awoke from my dream : ""'Twas night!""

Turkish embroideries, which, as is
well known, are largely in chain
stitch, bid fair to be in fashion.
Bulgarian embroideries, notably is
the floral designs affected by the
peasant class, are prominent among
novelty trimming., both for dresses
and for millinery. Bright coloured
tassels, such as are frequently noted
on the costumes of the native orient-

unexpected ways in the new costumes

CHILDREN.
The beginning of a manuscript poem, entitled "" The
Bushranger.""
Unfolding fair in sorrow's shade,
Like early flowers 'mid frost and snow;
How sweet, where grief her home hath made,
The heedless infant hearts, which glow
And gladden still with happiness,
We fondly pray may ne'er be less !
Howe'er the bosom bleed within,
Probed deeply by remorseful sin,
Or bruis'd by outward woe, the while;
How precious every infant smile,
Which innocence sheds round our path,
Like mercy's ray dispelling wrath !
Howe'er the joyous accents spoken,
May wound the beast already broken,
And make it feel more sorrowful;
How welcome still each syllable,
Which children, in their happy time,
Breathe, ere their souls have leant to crime !
Alas ! and the beloved child,
Who, rosy with confusion, smiled
When embryo reason's utterance hung
In broken sweetness on his tongue;
And fain, with clear expressive eye,
Each latent thought he would convey;
So lovely as to make us weep,
Because we may not, must not keep,
Where sunbeams vanish, flowers depart,
Unchanged, such treasure of the heart;
And he, when years are rolled away,
Will curse his fellow-man and slay !
Oh, where in this wide world is he,
A child again who would not be?
Poets have not one glorious flower
Too many, wreathed o'er childhood's bower :
Hearts which are blackest grown with guilt--
Hands reddest with the blood they've spilt--
Could they annul the fearful past,
The first to dictate to the last,
Would play with roses still, and be
Children through all eternity.

OUR bark, like a bird, takes her flight from the Tay,
With nearly three hundred souls on board,
And many are crowding to see her away,
But few who at parting one tear can afford.
They come not to sorrow, they come not to sigh,
But with three hearty cheers to bid us good bye,
And yet in their hearts they may wish us as well,
As if fast from their eye-lids the tear drops fell,
And mentally pray as they see us go forth,
Poor sons of a day! from the land of our birth,
That our beautiful bark may find on the deep,
The breeze still awake, and the tempest asleep,
Till that hour when a crowd like the present shall
stand,
And hail us with joy to Australia's strand,
That our days, as they fly, may be winged with con-
tent,
And our hopes realized to their utmost extent.
Hark! to the signal gun, it tells the heart,
That friends must now—perhaps for ever—part!
The sad uncertainty of future years,
Gives rise to thought, and serious thought to fears,
That now the eye its last long look may take,
Of those who ne'er forsook—could ne'er forsake,
Whose humble, honest, unpretending worth,
Must win regard while virtue's priz'd on earth.
In sorrows tide of tearful tenderness,
We press the hand we ne'er again may press!
And say—what ne'er by fond affection's ear,
Is heard without emotion, hope or fear—
Farewell! a lass, the saddest sound of all
That e'er from love's or friendship's lips did fall,
Farewell, that word remembrance tear will claim,
When cold the heart from which it warmly came.
Ah! happy they, whose hearts are moulded so,
Alike insensible to joy or woe,
That from the cradle onward to the grave,
Their owners scarcely know if hearts they have,
Let others livlier feelings glow or freeze,
Their minds are placid, and their souls at ease,
They ne'er at parting, turn to hide their grief,
And seek in solitude and tears relief,
In equanimity they calmly dwell,
Nor feel that throb which they could wish to quell,
Their home, their country, is the world at large,
No charge but self, that most precarious charge!
From scene to scene, from clime to clime, they range,
Enjoy the hour and never feel the change,
The ills of life which all are doom'd to bear
Press light on them—their future hath no fear!
Heave up the anchor, hear the Captain cry,
Ay, ay, sir, is the seaman's prompt reply,
And while they heave with brawny arm and strong,
They join, to cheer their labour, in a song,
And who so well as those who plough the main,
Can sing a cheerful, and heart-stirring strain?
Their hearts, their souls, into the song they throw,
And kindling sing till others listening glow,
And feel that nature, simple, unrefined,
Hath but to speak to win the willing mind.
One takes the lead, whose lungs make language tell
Then leaves his mates to bid the chorus swell,
In such a glorious burst of thrilling sound,
That care retires, and pleasure smiles around.",Bathurst Advocate ,"524,926,763,743,779,865,976,883,846,759,851,822,827,969,105,759,967,105,832,758,869,633,899,808,860,783,839,650,823,797,728,747,868,887,885,845,540,751,853,720,832,826,659,594,907,855,866,951,748,778,844,773,732,928,750,855,849,887,790,704,761,909,818,759,817",Sat 27 Jan 1849,"2613,2666,2707,2748,2789,2829,2869,2910,2951,2992,3032,3073,3113,3153,3199,3234,3275,3325,3357,3419,3458,3502,3539,3580,3621,3662,3703,3745,3784,3825,3866,3906,3945,3983,4027,4092,4137,4173,4213,4255,4296,4335,4375,4418,4455,4497,4538,4578,4619,4661,4700,4766,4807,4848,4888,4928,4968,5009,5049,5089,5130,5195,5233,5275,5317","2342,2120,2118,2118,2118,2120,2118,2120,2120,2121,2121,2123,2123,2123,2207,2123,2124,2207,2124,2127,2127,2126,2128,2127,2128,2127,2127,2127,2127,2127,2127,2128,2130,2128,2128,2129,2129,2130,2129,2129,2131,2126,2130,2129,2129,2130,2129,2128,2128,2131,2129,2130,2129,2129,2130,2129,2130,2129,2128,2128,2128,2129,2129,2127,2128",62044656,Page 1

Oh to be far away in some place deep
With running silence, where the only
sound
Is the soft munching of contented sheep
Cropping the daisied grasses all around!
Oh Just to lie long hours 'twixt sun and

Pearled with the lilac light as grass Is
pearled
Knowing that leaf and stem and blossoms
made

And safe to rush where Neptune's splash

These fads of theirs amuse me
Whon fetching of my mop.

Aboard a boat at all.

And bowls in grief and woe,

Abide thy time, act well thy part,
Be to thy purposo true ;
The present hour alone is thine :""
Tho' dark the night, do not repine,
The future keep in view.
And tho' the rising sun be veiled,
And its bright light by clouds be paled,
Perchance before the noon,
Dispersed each lowering cloud will be,
Leaving it shining clear and free
Prom morning's darkening gloom.

Prom cradle life to grave-yard plot,
Is but a changing scene ; -
Pond hopes, dark fears, glad joy, stern woe,
Alternately come and go
As in a troubled dream.
Trust not to fate, nor blindly tread
The thorny path with fear and dread ;
Trust to thy Father's care,
Who thy true efforts will attend,
Then Confidence with Hope will blend,
And banish blank Despair.
Be patient, studious, thoughtful brain
Dost think thou canst at once attain
The pinnacle of fame !
Offsprings o£ many a weary hour
One day may testify thy power,
And spread thy honoured name.
Be patient, pain-racked, mortal frail,
Condemned to live without the pale
Of Heaven's great blessing-health.
Bitter indeed the cup must bo,
But in the vast eternity
Shall live thy better self.
No resting place on earth is found, .
The camp fire ashes scattered round
Reiterate the talo ;
Nor will impatient longings cease,
Till gained are boundless realms of peace

STANZAS.
IN a morning of summer, my cares to beguile,
I strayed out to gaze on the green ocean's smile,
No sun-rays as yet their rich colouring gave,
But the ocean in silence rolled onward the wave.
And a dark cloud hung o'er it, until the gold sun,
From his pillow of waters his journey begun,
Then the shadow dissolved in a halo of light,
And the billows ebbed sweetly--delightfully bright.
Oh! thus may the sorrows that hang o'er my soul,
Like that shadow of darkness, far, far away roll;
And the moments of sadness be cheerful and gay,
While the rich sun of hope still illumines my way.

! has two or three samples of verse to submit to you.
First, two sugested by little boys who did not find
Christmas sufficiently elastic. The third about the
New Year that has just tripped into the world:
A LITTLE BOY'S PLAN.
""If I had made tho calendar,"" said Bobbie, yester-
day,
""I sort of think I'd have lt fixed in somewhat dif-
ferent way,
I'd not have put the Christmases so very far apart;
I think that six months 'tween 'em would please any
youngster's heart.
¡ ""And scattered through, the other months I'd have
a lot of times
On which we'd decorate the house and gally ring
the chimes;
On which we'd have, not Santa, hut some other Saint
! lllce him,
! Who'd go about and gratify pur every little whim.
""Who'd bring us cakes and candy in the middle of
July;
Who'd bring us cans and waggons when the Juno
sun's In the sky;
i Who when September came about would bring us
I lots of things
To malee us all as happy as a baud of Brownie Kings.
""In this way we'd have lots of things a-coniing all
I tho year,
And walting for the Christmas-time would not be
long and drear,
And best of all we'd not wear out our toys, and I
am sure
Tho old ones would be newer when we gave 'em to
the poor.""
A MAGNIFICENT SCHEME.
He was a tiny little lad, he was so full of schemes.
He wasn't greedy, but he had the most ambitious
droams.
Ho wanted every other child to have all sorts
of toys,
And never envied any of tho other little boys.
Dut as he thought of Christmas-time, and all
the joys lt brings,
And pondered o'er the hundred and the thousand
lovely things
Ho thought he'd like old Santa Claus to leave
when he Bhould call,
It filled him full of misery, his stocking was so
small.
""He cannot got ft quarter oí tlio things I want
thereiui
My stockings aro not very long, and, oh, my legs ^
are thin!
I wonder what I'd better do-the stockings will
not stretch.
They will not hold a hundredth part of what I
hope he'll fetch.""
And then he asked his mamma on what day
Santa'd come,
And when she said, ""On Tuesday,"" he just bit
his little thumb,
And said, ""Ha! ha! That's drying-day. I've got
a little plan:
I'll go and see the laundress,"" said this funny
little man.
""I'll tell her that I sort of think she ought to
string a line
From mantel-piece to window in that nursery of
mine,
And hang the stockings that I wore last week
just seven pair
Upon it, so's old Santa will observe 'em when
he's there!""
A HAPPY NEW YEAR.
Just at the turn of the midnight,
When the children are fast asleep,
The tired Old Year slips out by himself,
Glad of a chance to be laid on the shelf.
And the New Year takes a peep
At the beautiful world that is waiting
For the hours that he will bring:
For the wonderful things in his peddler's pack;
Weather, all sorts, there will be no lack,
And many a marvellous thing.
Flowers, by hosts and armies,
Stars, and sunshine, and rain!
The merry times and the sorrowful times.
Quickstep and jingle and dirge and chimes,
And the weaving of joy and pain.
When the children wake in the morning,
Snouting their ""Happy New Year,""
The year will be started well on his way,
Swinging along through his first white day,.
With the path before him clear.
Twelve long months for his journey;
Fifty-two weeks of a spell;
At the end of it all he'll slip out by himself,
Glad of a chance to be laid on the shelf,
At the stroke of the midnight bell.",Australian Town and Country Journal ,"497,1126,1103,1108,975,557,1102,78,1101,233,1062,1105,366,1129,286,1104,227,1105,292,1079,1102,98,1104,358,1126,389,1100,1099,291,1103,332,1103,167,1103,211,667,1099,1101,166,1099,163,1097,1100,433,1104,294,1101,477,1101,128,1103,171,1126,197,1104,252,1103,419,1101,307,1103,383,1105,301,1102,236,1100,294,1103,117,1059,337,1100,262,558,800,775,918,969,789,912,769,1099,919,699,675,699,1003,994,791,931,798,967,1013,761,840,626,998,939,803",Sat 4 Jan 1896,"4352,4410,4466,4505,4550,4616,4681,4731,4762,4816,4848,4890,4936,5013,5063,5098,5146,5180,5218,5263,5347,5396,5430,5476,5514,5560,5599,5681,5721,5765,5810,5850,5900,5932,5975,6026,6090,6132,6180,6216,6264,6301,6386,6429,6471,6516,6555,6599,6641,6686,6767,6811,259,338,376,422,459,506,586,633,672,718,758,803,841,888,967,1015,1053,1100,1138,1184,1223,1268,1322,1375,1418,1458,1501,1545,1629,1672,1712,1756,1800,1884,1927,1969,2011,2054,2137,2180,2223,2264,2307,2390,2433,2475,2518,2560","1898,1570,1597,1594,1595,1852,1597,1682,1599,1683,1596,1596,1682,1573,1683,1599,1684,1597,1573,1574,1599,1684,1597,1685,1573,1573,1597,1601,1573,1597,1683,1595,1682,1596,1684,1823,1598,1598,1685,1599,1683,1599,1597,1682,1594,1681,1596,1679,1594,1679,1593,1677,2760,2844,2758,2844,2759,2846,2761,2846,2760,2848,2760,2848,2762,2849,2765,2850,2763,2851,2765,2848,2766,2851,3034,2767,2810,2766,2769,2812,2768,2812,2768,2767,2812,2767,2813,2768,2768,2812,2768,2810,2769,2769,2812,2768,2812,2770,2771,2813",71240044,Page 10

_
The old road north of Wiseman's
Climbs up by cliff and ledge,
On great, grey, lichened buttresses,
Above the river's edge;
For faithfully they packed the stone,
In Solomon his day,
And wearily the builders wrought,
Who never drew their pay.
To right the roofs of Windsor
Are glinting in the sun,
The mist is on the crossing place,
The day is now begun—
A long, long day of liberty,
With sun and road and sky--
Ah, pity their captivity,
Who toiled in days gone by!
The yellow of the cornland,
The cliff's enpurpled state,
The old stone house, where Wiseman dwelt,
With gryphon-guarded gate—
I wonder here what viewless ghosts
Tramp through the heat of noon,
If down the road the clank of chains
Is heard beneath the moon ?
Or if the ferry cable
Creaks ghostly in the night,
To bear across the phantom gang
That may not bide the light ?
Light hearts to whom this happy land
Is free and blessed abode,
Pass on your way, but, passing, bless
The makers of the road!

A Gentleman.
I knew him for a gentleman
By signs that never fail ;
HÍB coat was rough and rather worn,
His cheeks were thin and pale- ;
A lad who had his way to make,
With little time for play
I knew him for a gentleman
By certain signs to day.
He met his mother on the street ;
Off came his little cap.
My door was shut ; he waited there
Until I heard his rap.
, He took the bundle from my hand,
And when I dropped my pen,
He sprang to pick it up for me,
This gentleman of ten.
He does not push and crowd along ;
His voice is gently pitched;
He does not fling his books about
As if be were bewitched.
He stands aside to let you pass;
He always shuts the door ;
He runs on errands willingly
To forge and mill and store.
He thinks of you before himself ;
He serves you it'he can ;
For in whatever company
The manners make the man.
Afc ten or forty'tis the same, . ,
. The manner tellB the tale; : *
And I discern the gentleman .

WHILST Grecian Legends proudly claim
The Triumph of their HOMER'S Name,
And MANTUA'S Bard, with fadeless Glory,
Crowns the bright Themes of classic Story, —
Surviving Genius fondly twines
Fresh Laurels round their hallow'd Shrines ;
And, from the Page of early Lore,
Loves to retrace those Days of Yore,
When the young Arts, by Learning nourish'd,
Burst from their Germs — matur'd — and flourished ;
And ATHENS, high, triumphant, and renown'd,
Saw her own Lustre gild the Nations round !
AND tho' succeeding Times displayed,
The Havock barbarous Hordes had made,
That swept with desolating Rage
The Boast of the AUGUSTAN Age ;
And hid, in cold oblivious Gloom,
The letter'd Pride of fallen ROME !
Still GENIUS slumber'd in the Waste,
To rise with freshen'd Grace at last :—
To see proud Science her fair Morn restore,
And shed her brightest Ray on ALBION'S Shore !
THEN SHAKESPEARE'S Muse, transcendent, hurl'd
Its Magic thro' a wondering World ;
Then MILTON'S bold aspiring Lyre
Glow'd with charm'd Fancy's hallow'd Fire;
And after Ages own'd, with Taste refin'd,
The boundless Empire of the human Mind !
AND, ALBION! Still on thy blest Isle
The Sister Arts supremely smile,
Protect the MUSES' favorite Seats,
And hover round their green Retreats.
HENCE, Fancy's Charm and Wisdom's Page
Have rais'd a New Augustan Age ;
And BRUNSWICK'S glorious RACE survives to own
A NATION'S TRIUMPH — AND A WORLD'S RENOWN !
To that high Race shall Genius bend,
Hail'd as her PATRON — GUARDIAN — FRIEND!
And blooming Wreaths, round Garlands gay,
Entwine on this auspicious Day.
OH ! could the Muse aspire to raise
To untrac'd Heights her Meed of Praise ;
This Morn should waken ev'ry Strain to Pleasure,
And her Lyre vibrate to the glowing Measure :
AND every BRITON, proudly sing,
A PRINCE ador'd — a PATRIOT KING!
Whose bright Career, from opening Youth,
Left the fond Pledge of FILIAL TRUTH ;—
THAT Pledge came pure from Virtue's Source,
And Honor mark'd its sacred Course;
Nor has a Gem more brilliant ever shone
To grace a MONARCH — or adorn His Throne !
AND, ALBION ! whilst thy glorious Arms
Have triumph'd 'midst the World's Alarms ;
And, with commanding Awe maintained,
The Fields thy gallant Warriors gain'd ;
Whilst suffering Nations round, afar,
Mourn the rude Ravages of War,
On thy calm Shores — thy smiling Plains,
PEACE, in her native Splendour, reigns, —
And laurel'd Trophies wave, in bright Array,
To grace, with festive Smiles, this halcyon Day !
AND, whilst AUSTRALIA'S favor'd Isle
Partakes the universal Smile,
And honors the benignant Hand
That nurtur'd first her Infant Land ;
SHALL not her PATRIOT CHIEF receive
All that fond Gratitude can give ;
Whilst every Heart responds to every Lay
That owns His fostering — His Paternal Sway!
THO' startled Hope, with anxious Eye,
And trembling Fear, with boding Sigh,
In chilling Sympathies await,
The Fiat of impending Fate. —
WHEN Time, that with relentless Power,
Sweeps the proud Dome and ""Cloud-capt Tower ;""
Shall steal with sullen Claim at last,
And mark His Reign of Glory past ;—
""REMEMBRANCE, LONG, TO PRIVATE WORTH ENDEAR'D,
SHALL HAIL THE FRIEND BELOV'D — THE CHIEF REVER'D !

BY RICHARD WILLIAMS.
THE JANISSARIES' LAMENT.
Gladios accingite socii,
Per patriam dilectam,
Per manes pa rum,
Per caras conjuges,
Et liberos raptos,
Pœnas dabint tyranni.
SHALL the gleam of our sabres no more shed dismay,
When we wield them on high in red battle's array,
The dread war-cry Insh Allah be thundered no
more,
As our falchions are buried in infidel gore.
Through ages of glory--the fierce Janissier,
Carried death to his foes on the point of his spear;
Midst the whirr of the bullet, the scymitars' clash,
He swept on his steed like the lightning's wild flash.
Where the standard of Osman unrolled to the wind,
Terror marched in its front--desolation behind;
The uncircumcised Christian dogs paled with
affright,
As the turban and crescent came on in their might.
Through helmet and cuirass--straight down through
the head,
As in fury we struck, our scymitars sped;
Where we rushed in the fight--there the corpses
were strewn,
Before us the valiant--behind us the groan.
But our glory has perished--the traitor and slave,
Now lord in the halls which were won by our
glaive;
Our Ortas and Ensigns are trampled in dust,
Our daughters subservient to Ottoman lust.
But again--but again will our valour prevail,
Again at our rising will Sultans turn pale;
The Janissier again keen sabre in hand,
To the conquered and terrified issue command.
We have sworn by the Prophet our wrongs to
avenge,
With hearts nerved by hate--arms bared for re-
venge;
Through thy streets, O Stamboul, shall be heard
the wild shriek,
The death scream of our foes when our vengeance
we wreak.
By the God of our fathers, the harem and mosque,
Shall be gilt with the flames of each burning
kiosque;
In the dead of the night, whan the Moslem lords
rest,
With shout, sword and torch we their domes will
invest.
At the clang of our arms--at our torches' red glare,
They shall wake but to perish in craven despair;
Their mansions reecho our dread battle cry,
As their heart's blood our garments and ataghans
dye.
Then again shall victorious the flag be displayed,
Of the dauntless in soul--of the never dismayed;
The Giaours of the west again shiver with fear,
At the lance and the sword of the stern Janissier.",The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser ,"504,471,516,333,498,354,290,359,453,739,737,738,81,652,617,740,738,740,735,706,739,115,742,740,133,617,738,185,637,720,740,104,661,636,658,620,576,682,737,113,736,109,736,226,737,148,724,746,128,740,66,739,99,740,714,636,742,79,721,736,693,727",Tue 9 Jun 1840,"512,584,652,724,754,795,830,864,900,967,1002,1036,1083,1106,1154,1189,1223,1258,1306,1341,1375,1411,1445,1492,1530,1563,1598,1639,1668,1715,1751,1786,1819,1855,1901,1936,1970,2004,2051,2096,2119,2165,2188,2227,2259,2298,2341,2377,2414,2446,2487,2515,2553,2598,2634,2669,2702,2734,2784,2820,2854,2890","365,384,350,452,452,375,455,348,329,248,247,246,284,244,246,244,246,248,249,247,247,286,248,250,285,250,252,287,251,248,250,287,246,251,248,249,249,248,249,285,249,285,250,286,249,284,248,245,287,250,285,250,283,249,250,250,247,275,249,252,251,247",2547354,Page 4

To pleieo the rough mab caused all that he said

At the lathe till his fingers vere narked to the bone,
Where the blood had gushed ont he keld up to be

To spank of himself he wis welcome and free ;
Buh I never thanked bim for speaking of me;
To drag me befere such a low scrubby erowd
As his friend and colleague, of whom be wai proud ;
That no one amongst them wai born BO obioure,
So bumble in life, so lowly and poor ;
That we, as a Ministry, ruso from poor men
An honour he felt to acknowledge to them,
That tonohed my pride sorely. I thought what ho

Was to »peak of me thus with a doable intent.

And now it demands he shall tell the maa'a name.

j Calling the Old Pioneers to Perth; /
What though the gyves of existence aré
galling.
What though they own not a rood
of the earth.
Hands are extended to grasp yours in
greeting.
Eyes brighter grow for the seeing
you soon;
Hearts near and distant are hopefully
beating
Life's setting suns are returning to
noon.
North, east and suth-'ard, they're
rolling their blueys.
Packing their port, their trunk and
valise,
Tracks leading coastwards are colored
with coo-ees,
Lives that were falling take on a
new lease.
Out where the wool camel waggons
are crawling,
Down where they gutter the karri
tree's girth.
The voice of the past and the present
is calling
Calling the Old Pioneers to Perth!
Greybeards who followed the brumbies
of Bayley,
Out to the eastward when Tilgarn
was young;
Talk of the Olden and Golden Days
gaily
Long before dishes aurifrouslyrung.
Mates of the pad and the prospecting
party.
Lads of the Tears when the Nineties
were new;
Yarning of yesterdays, honest and
hearty.
Bonanzas abounded and failures were
few.
Victims of tramps to the storekeepers*
I rushes,
Swamping it. back with a smile and
a song;
Lads who knew luck when it crumbles
and crushes.
Men who grew rich to the dolly's
ding-dong.
Those whose short-axe sent the salmon
gum sprawling,
Where the gold ounces gleamed deep
in the earth:
The voice of the past and Die present
is calling,
-Calling the Old Pioneers to Perth.
There will be speeches and there will
be stories,
Reminiscences, narratives, legenda
and toasts.
When Coolgardie arose in its glittering
glories.
Now a stark ruin night -haunted by
ghosts.
There will be yarns ot the yester-
years sturdy,
Tears when the metal meant less
than a mate:
Tears before lite was a harsh hurdy
gurdy.
Tears when we followed the finger
of fate.
There will be eloquence, simple and
stirring,
Tales of the township and tales of
the track;
Of the wheels of prosperity Time set
- a-whirring,
Of glittering ounces and shammies
grown slack.
Times when we chorus«ed, whate'er
was befalling.
Ballads of boyhood, of innocent
mirth;
For the voice of the past and thc
present is calling.
Calling the Old Pioneer» to Perth.

There will be gaps In the ranks we
remember.
They've bottomed on life's deep
auriferous run;
Boys who were with us in Bayley""«
September,
Mates who were fathers and brothers
in one.
There will be sighs for the friends who
have stumbled
Hard by the wayside all humans
must tread:
They rest, though no praises SOT
prayers were mumbled
Where their poor bones Ile In silence
outspread.
Drink to their mem'ry, and all be
upstanding.
Toast them in silence and toast them
in tears;
And before ye depart with a chorus
disbanding.
Mark ye the terrible toll of the years!

ln recent weeks, though most other civilised countries admit them
freely, Australian political and bureaucratic censors have banned world
famous plays, films, books, and now, a British-born woman whom Brit-
ain herself has no power, or desire, to exclude.
THO' censorious sages, in
fierce moral rages
On History's pages press,
heavy of hand;
When it comes to suppressin'
we are, we're confessin'
A boon an' a blessin' to this
pious land.
A Savonarola, a Cromwell,
whose mole a
Poor artist saved whole, a
Comstock or a Knox—
These were hefty joy-biffers;
but, classed as sin-
sniffers
Our temp'rament differs.
We're out of the box!
We're pure politicians; we feels our
positions;
We feels that conditions in this 'oly
land
Is clean, if bucolic. All frivolous
frolic,
All views vitriolic, if furrin' is banned.
Tho' merely elected, we feels we're
expected,
When sin is detected approaching our
shore,
To sieze it an' sock it; before they can
dock it
We ruthlessly lock it outside of our
door.
With horror'we're smitten when Brit-
ain, admittln'
The stuff that is written by
sin-sodden blokes,
Condones evil-livers. It gives
us the shivers;
Our righteousness quivers to
hark at their jokes.
They falsely befriend us an'
seek for to send us
Them works wot would end
us in dreadful desire.
Tho' we scarce understand
'em, ere ever they lan's

We scans 'em an' bans 'em
an' burns 'em with
fire.

vealin'

We're apt to get winkin' an' bashfully
shrinkin'
When critics unthinkin' starts raisin'

We're good at forgettin' that murder
an' sweatin'
An' startin'-price bettin' leaves much
to be done.
The land may be swimmin' in sin over-
brimmin' ...
But books, plays an' wimmin', we bans

Is it not time you ceased bowing to mono
grams aod rings,
And canfsand gloves and all asBerfeiveness?
And ceased to do business with institutions

The time, cramming their cupboards from
your scanty barns ?
Jrlow long ere you teach children to dis
tinguish education from goodness,
And -affable manners from goodness ?
And before you teach them that courage
of tea serves selfishness ? _
And how education is the indispensable
instrument of swindling ?
You seem unable to detect the untrust
worthy gentleman.
1 will tell yon his fashion :
Hp is at oase amqng men ;
Courageous, affable, obliging, kind, of
pleasant appearance
These tilings because they are pleasant to
him,
They are powwful aids to hi* ends also.
You will detect hun by his delight of
Ample comfort.
By paying his labourer*; Imt a tenth of the
sum ho charges fur a like amount of
work.
Plainly, he is announced by hi- resppet of
costly clothe
By his determination to lift on in th*4
World,
By his coneealed fast-clinging to saluted
positions, , -
By his prudent reticence at public meetings,
By his flaunting of the Labour candidate.
Democracy, teach your children to loathe

A FAIRY STORY OF TO-DAY.
THEKE ia nothing to do, and there's nothing to say,
And the rain, it rainoth every day ;
There is nothing1 amusing, and nothing now,
In fact, as I said, "" there i°. nothing to do.""
So spoke littlo Gretchen, and turned again
To watching tho rain on tho window pane.
Now she cried, "" There's tho clock, but it only struck
two;
What is to bo dono, wkon thero's'nothing to do ?""
"" Nothing to do ! "" said a voice at her side,
' ' Would you like to como with me for a ride? ''
Then Gretchen turned round, most delighted to see
Her good fairy godmother smiling with glee, ? ""
Telling the Story.
And tho very first tap of her high-heeled shoes
Quite startled tho child from hor fit of the blues.
A neat little figure, so quaint and so trim,
Her little high hat had a littlo broad brim,
And her dainty rod petticoat, quilted and neat,
Showed tho high buckled shoes on her brisk little
feet.
"" Oh, yes ! cried poor Gretchen, "" pray take me with
you,
Asl really am dying for something to do.""
""Very well,"" said her godmother, "" prithee be
quick,
And jump by my aide on this fairy broomstick.
It does not rain now, and wo will not go far,
So don't stay to dress, but come just as you aro.""
Quoth Gretchen, *' I'll get hat and cloak ero wo go j
I am not quite a fairy as you aro, you know.""
The broomstick was swift, and the broomstick was
fleet,
So, it soon set them down in tho near village Btreot.
""And now,"" said tho fairy, "" you just follow mo,
I hav9 touched you with fern sood, so no one will
see.""
Then straightway she opened a rickety door,
And they saw a poor baby alono on tho floor ;
Such a pitiful baby, so palo and so thin,
With hardly a garment to wrap itself in.
It gave littlo Gretchen a sorrowful shock,
And she said, ""I must mako that poor baby a
frock."" ?
Her godmother nodded, and merrily smiled,
But soon she led Grotchon away from the child,
And showed her its mother, who lay on tho bed,
With scarcely a pillow to ease her poor head.
Said Gretchen, "" She looks very ill, don't you think,
11 may bring her some food or somo nioe cooling
I drink?""
Her godmother gave to her broomstick a twirl,
And thoy stood by tho sido of a little lame girl ;
Sho had no ono to comfort hor hour af tor hour.
Cried Grotchon, "" I should liko to bring her a
flower !""
"" Very good,"" quoth tho fairy, ""pray doit if you
can ;
But, now, ooine and call on my poor old blind man.""
"" Oh, doar."" said her godchild, how lonely he looks !
Might I read to him sometimes somo comforting
books P
"" And, O godmother, look at that poor littlo lad,
Ho is shaking with cold, and so wretchedly clad,
While I am wrapt in this velvet and fur !
Don't you think I may make him a warm comforter?""
"" Our ride,"" said the fairy, "" has not been in vain,
And now, if you pleaso, wo will fly homo again,
I will call on you, dear, just a week from to-day,
And then I shall hoar what you then have to say.""
The week went by, and the godmother came
In her little red petticoats, gay as a flame.
She tapped tho floor, and sho laughed outright
To see her fair godchild so busy and bright.
Then Gretchen looked up with a sunshiny smile, I
And she folded her work in a neat littlo pile.
She laid it a-top of her plentiful store,
Saying, ""Now that is done, I can make something
more.
The days aro so busy, I rise with the sun,
But I never can do all there is to be dono.
When wants are so many, and workers so few,
How can anyone say they have nothing to do?""

The tincture of eternal sleep.

The dream-seeds of immortal death.

A Day That is Dead.
BARVILLE HAMPTON.
Townsville, September, 1889.
Was I dreaming in the twilight when I thought I heard
your tread,
And felt the pressure of your hand, and heard the words
you said!
Did it hap, or was it fancy, that you whispered as or
old! _
Aa I retted 'neath the wattle tree where first our love
was told.
The earth waa wrapped in glory, for the summer sun
had set,
But your presence brought back sunshine, and it seemed
day lingered yet.
The old dull aching in my heart seemed gone with each
past care,
The world held nought of danger, love, but I for you
would dare.
W» wero walking 'neath acacias* boughs as of t in days
gone by,
And, lingering by the crystal stream, we watched the
daylight die:
The ripple of the streamlet seemed to lull my aching
brain,
And in the musio of your voice my heart forgot ita pain.
I was dreaming: ah, the waking from that long re
membered bliss
Was death unto my longing heart, and in that faltering
kUa
I felt our last good-bye was said, our hut fond parting
o'er;
' T was but a dream, love, sent to tell that we shall meet
no more.",The Queenslander ,"858,482,664,578,339,472,900,179,899,154,900,648,900,147,901,128,900,271,901,155,901,192,901,137,901,212,900,96,900,886,255,900,66,900,76,899,143",Sat 26 Oct 1889,"416,707,841,906,2098,2132,992,1028,1057,1096,1135,1162,1189,1224,1280,1318,1346,1378,1413,1452,1480,1518,1569,1608,1636,1676,1706,1743,1770,1828,1866,1894,1932,1962,2002,2028,2076","345,528,435,480,852,351,318,384,318,384,317,384,317,387,317,381,317,386,317,383,317,383,317,381,317,383,317,383,317,317,386,317,383,317,384,318,386",19818136,Page 785

FASHIONABLE EDUCATION.
ANTI..
D EAR MADAM, I've called for the purpose
Of placing my daughter at school;
She's only thirteen, I assure you,
And remarkably easy to rule.
rd hare her learn painting and music,
Gymnastics and dancing, pray do,
Philosophy, grammar, and logic;
You'll t«ach her to read, of course, too.
I wish her to learn every study,
Mathematics are down in my plan ;
But of figures she scarce has an inkling.
Pray instruct her in those if you can.
I'd have her taught Spanish and Latin
Including the language of France •
Never mind her very bad English,
Teach her that when you find a good chance.
On the harp she must be a proficient,
And play the guitar pretty soon,
And ring the last opera music.
Even though she can't turu a right tune.
You must see that her manners are finished,
That she moves with a Hebe-like grace;
For though she is lame and one-sided,
That's nothing to do with the case.
Now, to you I resign this young jewel.
And my words I would have you obey;
In six months you return her, dear madam,
Shining bright as an unclouded day.
She's no aptness, I grant you, for learning,
And her memory oft seems to halt;
But, remember, if she's not accomplished.
It will certainly all be your fault.

A new way of collecting a bad debt was most

A good story is told of a captain who went
into a grocery where were a lot of loungers, and
■o one offered him a seat. Knowing every
thing about the grocery, he went behind
the counter, and seizing a keg marked
powder, threw it upon the fire, exclaim*
ing: ""Gentlemen, it's my opinion that we're
lived long enough."" The way they ran out of
that store was a caution to "" ground and lofty
tumbling."" Of course the keg was empty.
Among the passengers in a stage-coach was a
little gentleman who had possibly seen fire
summers. The coach being quite full, he sat in
the lap of another passenger. While on the
way, something was said about pickpockets, and
soon the conversation became general on that
interesting subject. The gentleman who was
then holding our young friend, remarked:
"" My fine fellow, how easy I could pick your
pocket."" ""No you couldn't,"" replied he, "" l>e
been looking out for yoa all the time!""
Cot/ldn't Fool Him.—l knew a nice old
fanner who nerer had a paper in his house till
he was fifty years of age. His father left him
two hundred*acres of choice land, whioh he
worked as well as he knew how, and made a
comfortable living. One spring the postmaster
told him that if he would subscribe for an agri
cultural paper, read it carefully, and work ac
cording to instructions, that he would warrant
him to dear a thousand dollars that year. On
these conditions he paid for the paper, read it,
worked faithfully, and at the end of the year he
figured up carefully and found that he had
cleared $960. He sued the rascally postmaster
for the other forty, but by some dodge of the
law the villain cheated him out of it. Erer
since then the old gent has been down on post*
masters and newspapers.— Sural New Yorker.
At a polling-booth for the Montrose Burghs
a stalwart voter, having given his name and ad
dress to the polling sheriff, was asked for whom
he voted, when he shouted his reply in sten
torian tones, ""Cornal Macdonal', of coorte: I
kent him when he was Booking his mither!""
At another of the booths a respectable-looking
voter, evidently one of the newly-enfranchised
classes, and knowing nothing of election form
alities, advanced to the sheriff's table, when the
following colloquy ensued. Sheriff: ""Do yoa
wish to rote, sir?"" Voter: ""Yes."" Sheriff:
""What is your name?"" Voter: ""What's
yours ?"" Sheriff (after having got his name) :
"" Who do you vote for ?"" Voter (placing his
arms akimbo on the table, and, with a knowing
and familiar smile): "" Wha are ye for y'rsel' ?""
The Banner gives a thrilling account of an
accident which befel a lovely girl. She was
apparently the possessor of ""great wealth of
golden hair ;"" but while standing on the side
walk, chatting with some companions, this
""golden hair"" attracted the attention of a
hungry mule which was harnessed to a fruit
waggon near by. The vicious beast caught the
beautiful tresses between his teeth, and gave
them such a jerk as pulled them entirely out of
her head! The unfortunate girl was in a dis
tressed condition, but all attempts to rescue
the precious article from the wicked animal
were in vain—he was resolved to chew the choice
morsel to hia heart's content. The young lady
was conveyed home in a cab, and, at the last
accounts, hopes were entertained of her re

A RECESSIONAL.
When wars and rumoure hold the land.
And Death reaps with unsparing hand,
When manifold temptations wait
To stay our footsteps' halting gait,
When kingdoms fall, and dangers press,
And knowledge fails, and eight grows less.
When all the earth resounds with strife,
Defend us, Lord of Death and Life.
Until the last farewell is said.
Until the sea gives up her dead,
And distant graves of veldt and stone,
Surrender what is not their own,
Until the dry boues of the plaiu
Awake at thy command again
To mystic power of living breath
Defend us, Lord of Life and Death.

SWEET harbinger of spring,
How ofb thy praises ring, ""
For poets, love to sing .
Of thee sweet flower.
In every shady nook,
Or by the running brook ;
Or where *e least would look,
Thou shed'st thy power.
Thy sweet retiring ways,
Demand a song of praise,
Nor are man's sweetest lays
Enough for thee.
Though small, with fragrance blest,
So modest, so at rest,
I envy thy calm rest
tío pure, so free.
Thy bow'r of dark green leaveB !
Which kindly nature weaves,
'Neath which there's nought that grieves
Oh ! for such peace I
And even when thon dieit
'Midst em'rald gravea thou liest,
Thy perfume rises highest,
When thou dos't cease.
May I resemble thee
And God in nature see.
And bless. His name that He
To me has given
A life that I might know,
And ease some soul of woe,
Then leave my name below,
And fly to heaven.

TO AN INFANT, SLEEPING.
Rest, little one, rest, in thy holy sleep,
Dreaming of fairy things ;
Beautiful, placid, calm, and deep,
In Heaven's imaginings.

Thy tiny couch are still for thee ;
And hushed is each voice and slightest sound,
To preserve thy pure dream's ecstacy.
Like a cherub from high, reposing on earth,
Thou liest so guileless and fair ;
Whilst on thy young lips the smile of thy mirth
Makes me pray thy raptures to share.
Oh ! live in thy beauty, beloved and adored,
And ripen in virtue and bliss ;
May cares ne'er oppress thee, nor dangers accord,
And thy last sleep be quiet like this.

THERE'S a bleak, black world without,
And the rain falls fast;
And the wind, with a whine and a shout,
Blows buffeting past
To wail thro' the tortured trees,
With cold, wet breath,
Like a choir of dank banshees

And I juggle with rhymes.

And the trend of our times.

These columns tell
Of earth and its warring views,
And I sigh, ""Well, well!""

And I ponder then
Of hopes and the dreams and the rage
And the folly of men.

And where do we gain?
But—twenty short years ago,
Ah, then we were sane!

We ravage and waste,
Dull, sentient things, half-dazed
By our own mad haste;
Selling content for gold,
Our peace for a fad.
Alas, for the wisdom of old!
We are mad! stark mad!
How, when, came earth's golden age—
If ever it shone?
Wise years of the saint and the sage,
These are goner—long gone,
Never to blossom again
'Mid a peace well-won,
In a world of the simply sane.
We are doomed! We are done!
When a score more years drift on,
Then another shall dwell

THE NOMINATION.
I.
PARKESENNERY of Sydney
By the Empire paper swore
That Donaldson the Hamlets
Should represent no more;
By the Empire paper swore it
On the nomination day;
And bade his messengers run forth
East and west, and south and north,
To summon his array.
And east and west, and north and south,
His messengers ran fast,
And the back slums of Sydney
They summoned forth in haste;
Shame be on the false Bunchman
Who lingers in his home
When Parkesennery of Sydney
To the election bids him come.
III.
The horsemen and the footmen
Come pouring in amain;
And many a crowded omnibus,
Discharges upon the plain--
(The grassy plain of Redfern,
Still wet with morning dew)--
A mob of Sydney Bunchmen,
A noisy motley crew.
IV.
And now hath Sydney City
Sent forth her tale* of men;
The footmen are about fourscore,
The horsemen about ten.
Right opposite the hustings
Is met the great array;
And a proud man is Parkesennery,
On the nomination day.
For the bold Sydney Bunchmen
Were ranged beneath his eye,
And well he knew their stentor lungs
Would flinch not--howl or cry--
And with their yells, and groans, and cries,
Their cat-calls, and their shrieks,
He thought it quite impossible
That Donaldson could speak.
Then on the hustings stood Breillat,
As he had stood before,
And nominated Donaldson
To represent once more.
Out spake Breillat full roundly,
The Bunch must straight go down;
For if the Bunch should reign supreme,
God help our noble town.
VII.
And then outspoke one Lucas,
An elector big and strong,
And made a speech as forcible
As it was loud and long;
And little did he care for all
The Bunchmen's noise and fun,
But he crossed his arms on his broad chest,
And waited till they'd done.
And next came forth one Richardson,
Who in the Hamlet dwells;
But 'tis a pity that he left
The leather that he sells;
And loud he scouted Donaldson,
Without remorse or ruth;
But some thought it had beeen as well
If he had stuck to truth.
IX.
And then stood forth another man,
Whose name they say was Brown:
And he harangued the mob below,--
In language all his own.
He called himself a working man,
As doubtless was the case;
But he came in such a hurry,
He forgot to wash his face.
And then stood forth bold Donaldson,
To address the dark array:--
Free and enlightened citizens,
Full well I ween were they.
For what's the use of freedom,
If one may not howl and shriek,
And interrupt bold Donaldson
When he attempts to speak.
From these enlightened citizens
A storm of yells arose--
Such as one has not often heard,
Nor wished to hear,--God knows.
But bravely stood forth Donaldson,
Nor from the tumult shrunk,
Though fierce were those free citizens,
And some of them were drunk.
XII.
And boldly then did Donaldson
That motley crowd survey,
And said that they should hear him
If he waited there all day;
And oft he raised his manly voice.
And tried in vain to speak,
Amidst a storm of yells and groans,
And many a fiendish shriek.
XIII.
A proud man is Parkesennery
That nomination day;
As from the hustings he surveys
The Bunchmen's fierce array;
A proud man is Parkesennery
Well knowing as he stands,
His nominee is quite secure
To gain the show of hands.
And then stood forth John Campbell,
A man of small renown;
And on the mob of Bunchmen
He smilingly looked down;--
And hushed was the loud tumult,
For the Bunchmen knew that when
A Campbell speaks there something comes
That's worth the hearing then.
XV.
Then out spoke this John Campbell,
And told the mob below,
If they sent him to Parlament,
The whole hog he would go;
And then he paused and scratched his head
For sense that would not come;
For it -was somewhat evident
There was nobody at home.
He said he'd give away the land--
A mile to every man;
And do it cheaper even still
If he only knew the plan.
No matter whether Chinaman
Or savage from Lefoo,
He'd give them all the suffrage
And vote by ballot too.
XVII.
Then loudly cheered the Bunchmen,
Saying, ""You're the man for us;""
And then they broke the meeting up
And rushed to omnibus.
For doubtless they were hungry,
Being long past dinner time;
And homeward, too, I took my way
To tell the tale in rhyme.

having his houso locked np securely at night jBomuoh
so as to incur the ridioulo of his wife, who often
deolarod that no burglar could frighten her. One
night, after a matrimonial discussion on the Bubjeot,
tho hnsband determined to test his spouse's courage,
and so about midnight he slid oat of bed, and, after
slipping on a long pair of whiskors ho had oonoealed
for the purpose, ho stole around to tho other Bide of

tho half-aroused woman tonohod tho property beard,
and whispered ; "" S-s-s-s-h ! How very imprudent

with features pinched with cold, called at our f riond's

was about to send him to tho right-about with a
savage "" No,"" when a something about the man's
face made him think that thia ono was possibly d.«
serving of oharity. Soho qneationod him, and drew ont
What appeared to bo a tolerably atraight story of mis-
fortune, resulting in tho loss of work, thus eompóllinfj
him to beg. "" Do you drink ?'' asked tho merohant,
"" No, sir !"" answorod the other, a little indignantly.
"" Do I look liko it ?"" The merohant was compelled
.to inwardly admit that his palo faoo did not look
like tho phiz of a drinking man. ""But,"" con-
tinued tho morohant, "" I supposo you would prefer a
tenponoa to a good warm breakfast?"" ''No, sir,""
replied the beggar j ""I would rather have the break-
fast."" This seemingly honest answor threw him
'off'hiB guard, and he handed him a quarter, tolling
him to go and get a breakfast. "" Thank you,"" said
tho fellow, as he oarefnlly laid away the ooin in an
inside pocket of his coat. ""Now, there bo men
mean enough to take money from a gentleman like
you and thon go off and poddle it out for rum. ' But
I ain't that kind of a ohap-not much. Good
day, air."" This little speech aroused the merchant's
suspicions, and ho told ono of his dorks to shadow
him and seo whore he brought np. Ho turned the
first corner, and there mot a companion, and as the
derk was following on behind, heard the following
dialogue :-"" Well, old rooster, what did you get?""
""Not a cent. How did you make out?"" ""Oh.Igot
a quartor. My total abstinence face did the business.
¡Your mm face spiles yon for a first-class beggar. But

saw them slide into a saloon, and when he wont back
and reported, tho merohant was convinced he had
j been sold again. If that total abstinonoo face shows

at tho toe of the merchant's boot.

THE BREAKING OF THE
OROUGHT.
By H. S. Leg§e.
Up. high with the windows; throw wide
every door;
There's a new thing about:
The blue, ol a pitiless sky is no more;
We have done with the drought.
The clods that were cracking with heat,
every one.
How they suck up the rain!
The plants in the garden, all wilted, un
done,
Tbcir heads uplift again.
The birds cut of sight are attuning their
throats,
Piping low, piping loud:
'Neath the eaves you can hear their sweet
satisfied notes;
Every tree has its crowd.
The breeze comes caressing and cool to the
face:
Open window and door
Till it sweeps every chink in this stupefied
place

""I 'ope you enj'yed yer visit, tho' brief has been
yer stay,
And that they've done the thing genteely, have
Quin and Kernel Gray;
Meet me promptly in the Lobby, when you returns
to town,
And believe me yers sincerely, William Ant'ny
Brown.""
Prompt I packed up my portmanty, and tuck it to
the boat,
Which the steamer was the ""Ipswich,"" the ugliest
boat afloat,
But the Capt'n he's a very brick, and that they all
diskiver,
Which travels up or down with him, upon the
Bremer River.
Away she quickly darted--soon disappears the
town,
And our noses soon do indikate, we're near the
""Biling Down,""
Where the Ipswich Cav'lry Captin, which his name
is Smith I think,
Stood stirring of his tallow pots, and making of a
stink.
The day was fine, the sun did shine, the water
wasn't rough,
Soft blew the breeze, past flew the trees, and the
mansion of De Muff,
Oh many sweet and nice things, upon the way we
saw,
Until the wharf at Brisbane, alongside we did
draw.
I 'astened to the Upper 'Ouse, as quickly as I
could,
And as I entered, heard the voice of Mister Western
Wood,
Which in oriental langwidge, peculiarly his'n,
Was persuadin' of the 'Ouse to send the 'Currier's'
Ed. to pris'n.
But I mustn't tell what past--mums the word--
""no fears""--
For its wery wicked treason, to redicule the Peers.
Besides it's not a fitting subjeck, for poetic
elocution,
And might bring me to be j'ined in the 'Currier's'
persecution.
But if I mayn't be disrespectful, it is no harm to
praise,
So in praise of 'on'ble members, my 'umble vice I'll
raise;
And my verses, one and all, with praises shall be
shod,
Of the President, and Members, not forgetting the
Black Rod.
Which the last's a digniterry, of horful mien and
look,
He'd make a splendid picter, if he'd have his
likeness took;
But with his rod and sable garments, it puzzles
the observant,
To tell if he's a butler, or a sort of upper servant.
Compigne is a trump, he is, if not the best
logician;
M'Dougal is of nothing worth, as an arithmetician;
M'Connell seems to think it hard, he's got to leave
his station;
And 'Arris looks most wondrous wise, though lost
in botheration.
But the pick of all the 'ouse is Lawer Dan, yer sees,
Which he's got some little nouse, and presides o'er
committees;
Burley Balfour he's a mason, and been branded
with hot irons,
So he 'sociates real property with equitable lions.
Old Yaldwyn is a jovial blade, an honest hearty
sinner,
""All there"" he is at making love, or enj'ying a
good dinner;
A gentleman 'mongst gentlemen, a nob amongst
the nobs,
And 'nointed well with dugong ile, is wily Doctor
Hobbs.
But a sudden call of dooty, compels me here to
stop,
And until a future period, the subjeck to let drop;
Up again I'll pick it, when there's no other fish
to fry,
And so no more at present, from yours truly,

Fit embloins of lier lovo and mino ;
Tho lilies decked her vine-clad bow'rs,
With fragrant roses red as wino. ' . r
« She smiled, but tears wera in her eyes,
And on her cheeks tho roses lay,
Whilst with her ponting Ups she trios
Some gentle"" word of love to say. .
Tho flowers fell softly at her foot, .
The lilies white and roses red, .
Her hands in mino so softly meet;
And yet no word of love she said. . '

FOR THE WHOLE OF THE YEAR 1831.
TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR,
CAPTAIN-GENERAL.
The following One for the Year 1831,
IS MOST HUMBLY INSCRIBED,
By his most dutiful and obedient Servant,
HENRY WRENSFORD.
Kirkham, January 1, 1831.
See Stella, see his ruddy face!
The New Year comes with regal pace,
And mounts his torrid throne;
See how he shakes his visage more,
With golden rev'rence mantl'd o'er,
And blessings round him thrown.
The youthful Spring, gay sprightly Maid,
With eye reluming robes array'd
Resigns her vernal pride;
Now more, soft melting, as they stay
The fragrant balmy Zephyr's play,
Bright Sol must now preside.
Hail! bounteous Year of Thirty one!
Welcome, thrice welcome, be they Sun,
Thy gifts I grateful sing;
Join hear and tongue to bless the Day,
My muse inspire the sacred la?,
To hail Great WILLIAM KING!
The joys transported wait around,
And music breathes her softest sound,
If Stella's presence cheer;
Late, where we till'd the fruitful soil,
See now rich harvest crowns our toil,
To bless the op-ning Year.
See our infant Commerce fly
Around the Globe with searching eye,
And own the fostering care
OF HIM who, spite of faction's tongue,
Paternal shall our joys prolong,
Whilst we his name revere!
Yes, there's a few,—a faithful Band,—
Who dare, with honest front to stand
Against the ingrate shout!
The creatures of mild Mercy's hand,
The blast and mildew of the land,
a wretched rabble rout!
Enough of this unpleasing theme,
Let smiling Hope illume the scene,
And future prospects raise;
Let Jocund sounds salute the morn,
And rosy bloom the hills adorn,
All emulate to praise!
Long may the wreath of health entwine
Around thy brows its clustered vine,
In dignity serene;
Long may thy progeny extend
The sacred name of Father, Friend,
To ages yet unseen!
In conscious rectitude and peace (!)
Thou shalt behold the Monarch's face,
In Virtue's armour clad!
His gracious smile on thee will shine,
Reflect the self-approving sign,
AND DRIVE THY FOEMEN MAD!

The cases of the various receivers of stolen
goods occupied the greater part of Tuesday,
at the Police office; the examinations were
conducted in the private room.
Complaints are making of the difficulty
which respectable Householders, as well as
un-respectable ones, experience, in obtaining
female servants from the Factory, lately, al-
though there are eight hundred at present
confined there. (N.B. We are told that
the Committee are annoyed at the treatment
the female Convicts receive from Household-
ers in Sydney. Some send for them to make
prostitutes of them. Others send for them
that cannot afford to board, lodge and clothe
them decently. And others who are respec-
table and in good circumstance from caprice
and a tyrannical disposition, change their ser-
vants so often as to put the Government to great
expense. There are the circumstances we un-
derstand which put the Committee to a stand-
still. Nevertheless, 800 women are an enor-
mous number for the Crown to maintain, and
we should think that the whimsicalities of
their employers is to be excused on account
of the utter worthlessness, in general, of these
persons—we mean the female convicts of New
South Wales. We have employed them for
twenty years, and they get worse rather than
better. ED.)
The good folks of Windsor still com-
plain of the very dilapidated state in which
Howe's Bridge is allowed to remain, not-
withstanding every time they pass the
temporary one with a dray or chaise, eight
pence is demanded, and then they run a
risk of drowning or a good ducking at the
very lest; had the circuits been conti-
nued, we have no doubt this would have
been remedied long ere this. But Grand
Juries are wanted to put such things to
rights.
The system of rewards and punishments
adopted by Captain Clunie at Moreton
Bay, they say gives general satisfaction
to all classes of persons on the establish-
ment, which is now in a quiet state, prov-
ing that the continual and severe floggings
of Captain Logan were superfluous.
Chalker being in custody, the fight be-
tween him and Morgan the black, is post-
poned, but Kable has challenged him for
the honour of Australia, and the fight will
take place on an early day.
A large quantity of plunder, which our
readers may remember was stolen from a
dray belonging to Mr. McQuade, has at
last, through the information of Walmsley
and Webber, been discovered, stowed
away in a hollow tree; but unfortunately
the information came to late, as the grea-
ter part of the goods are damaged.
His Majesty's Attorney General having
resigned his Commission on Sunday last,
the Criminal side of the Supreme Court is
closed for the present.
Captain Rossi took up his old berth at
the Police Office on Tuesday, after his re-
turn from sheep shearing. He appears in
""rude health,"" and from the pleasing ro-
tundity which now distinguishes his person,
we should surmise, that during his absence
he has been living on wild ducks, silver eels,
and last but not least, maize-fed pork.

Its depth and strength thou enns't not know.
And thercforo enns't not weep.

Tho choral hymn too clear.
Tho pauso 'twixt symphony and song,

By every breeze that plays among
The everlast ing hills.
No smile no tear, no cry of minc,
Can reach theo where thou art,
Thy hoing merged in life divine
Hath lest its mortal part.

Aro all too weak for thoso briidit spheres,

IN ENGLAND.
D.B.W. SLADEN.
IN baby January
I met a little fairy;
Halfway in February
I wooed—her name was Mary.
In March she was arch,
In April grew tender,
In May dawned the day,
In June the full splendour
Of a woman's love
Filled our common heaven;
In July it throve,
August saw its even ;
One September night,
Starlit, it fell sober;
Even that poor light
Flickered in October.
Rheumatic old November
Quenched its last smould'ring ember,
And when the year was dead
Even memory had fled.",The Queenslander ,"858,490,289,210,279,268,467,340,470,365,335,389,424,290,439,281,331,347,325,326,336,408,591,458,369",Sat 19 Nov 1881,"306,591,728,784,1586,849,882,915,946,1003,1038,1071,1104,1139,1173,1206,1241,1274,1307,1342,1376,1436,1469,1504,1537","220,387,498,537,770,359,359,359,357,359,357,359,357,359,357,357,357,356,357,357,357,357,354,356,357",20711103,Page 649

Respectfully Inscribed to ALICE CLAUDINE, LADY NORMAN.
MARY HANNAY FOOTT.
Brisbane, 11th May, 1805.
FAREWELL, dear Lady! Bright the hour
That brought you; sad that bears away;
Yet—English fields are all a-flower,
And English hedgerows sweet with May;
Love there as here shall be your dower—
'Tis not for us to bid you stay.
Farewell ! Oh not alone the few
Familiar friends will miss you here
How excellent soe'er the New
Be slow to place another peer
To her whom now they bid adieu—
Of all Vice-Queens the one most dear !
Your helpful care the couch has spread
For suffering babes; angelic toil !
On wounds of women shamed you shed
Samarian balm of wine and oil;
As Sister, with the scorned broke bread—
You, with white raiment free from soil!
And women-hands that toil your hand
Has touched and strengthened. Mothers tell
Of the sweet Presence, come to stand
By the new-born, where poor folk dwell,
With generous gifts. Throughout the Land
Is none but grieves to say Farewell.
Farewell, dear Lady All good things
Be yours the All-Giver may bestow.
Its folds abroad the Ensign flings;
The sea-tide swells the river-flow;

TO C. H.
I would sit at your feet for long days
To hear the sweet Muse of the Wild
Speak out through the sad and the passionate lays
Of her first, and her favourite child.
I would sit at your feet, for my soul
Delights in the solitudes free ;
And I stand where the creeks and the cataracts roll,
Whenever I listen to thee !
I would sit at your feet, for I love
By the gulches and torrents to roam ;
And I long, in this city, for woodland and grove,
And the peace of a wild forest home !
I would sit at your feet, and we'd dwell
On the scenes of a long-vanished time ;
While your thoughts into music would surge and would
swell,
Like a breeze of our beautiful clime !
I would sit at your feet, for I know,
Though the World in the Present be blind,
That the amaranth blossoms of Promise will blow
When the Ages have left you behind !
I would sit at your feet, for I feel
I am one of a glorious band,
That ever will own you, and hold you their Chief,
And a monarch of Song in the land !

Ah! to be out where the sun sets,
Fire red, in a flaming arc,
Flushing the paling horizon,
Challenging the coming dark.
To pause when the evening's soothing
A spent day into a swoon,
Lulled by an ethereal whisp'ring,
Like a hushing mother's croon!
Where a pure, sweet bedtime 6tory
Tunes in with the night's soft
balm,
When somewhere a horse bell's tinkle
Floats lisht on a restful calm.
And. oh, while a moon rides, bridging
Wide gaps in a white patched
screen,
What peace to lie tracing her back
ground
Of jewelled velveteen!
What joy to tramp while the last
stars
Flash out in the rushing dawn,'.
How free to be there, unwanted
By a world soul squeezed in pawn;
Phrasing a paean to the sunrise,
Thinking of work-dull slaveE,
And vague ideas of freedom,
They chant in their routine graves!
Afar, where the miles lead northward,
What peace in the brooding noon
To dine to the wild bush music,
Dose off in a dreamy swoon!
Aud then in the lull of evening,
When camped, what sweet content
While slaves are being evicted
For a strange thing known as rent!
Wide is the world to the westward,
North is a free man's land.
Time is a bagman's riches,
To squander with lavish hand.
Smoke stacks stand to the eastward.
Where the dole men skimp and
whine.
Me for the long lead regions,
'Where all that 1 see is mine.

SUNDAY SBPTEMBER 7th, 1834.
FAIR as this Morn—bright as this Morning's Sun
Were those one week ago—the Sky its crimson glow
Spread forth as it does now—and lo ! thy course is run,
And thou art laid, midst great and lowly, low.
Ah ! was that crimson blush that Heaven o'erspread
The harbinger of Blood—to summon to the Dead
Unhappy Man ! thyself !—No hand to save,
Thou, mighty Spirit ! prostrate in thy Grave
Dost lie.—Peace to thy Ashes, then,—no power,
No prayer can now avert thy Doom.—
Tho' thus my Tears I pour upon thy Tomb ;
No Friend, no Kindred soothed thy dying hour,
Cut off by cruel hand in Manhood's bloom,
Thou flourishedst, and passedst as a summer shower.

MINISTRY.
[Fiom the Port Darwin' Debating and
Literary Societies Manuscript Magazine,
January 2Gth, 1894.]
Here lies poor Macdouald as straight as a
gun.
No more his political show will be ruir;
No more will he blacken those landholders'
eyes,
And teach his blind country the way to be
wise.
His harp of one string on the willow is
"" hung,
His land bill unhatched and his honour
unsung.
It's here 'neath this stone where poor
Williams "" sits down.""
He was trusty and true, though tanned a
bit biown.
His fall was to him so much of a shocker
It stiffened him out as straight as a knocker.
The crow of his rooster that comes to his
door,
To his task in the shop will wake him no
more.
His loud-somuling anvil stands silent and
lone ;
His hammer's unlifted : his bellows unblown:
His fires are gone out and his ashes are
cold ;
And six feet of earth on his bosom is rolled.
Had he only survived his last fatal day,
He would have been older, and possibly
may
Have regained his lost seat and rose to a
peer.
And therefore would not have been "" sittiug
down"" here.
Of March flies we've heard, but here lies a
March-ant ;
His vigour was great, though his stature
was scant.
His aim was to be a political leader,
But nature designed him to be a man
feeder,
So when he came here fresh from life's
heated battle,
He knew less of men than he did about
cattle.
Here Adcock reclines beneath this old
willow :
A volume of ""Hansard"" serves him for a
pillow ;
He decided by it on every occasion,
And promptly sat on each wanton evasion.
Still, members brought forth some very wild
notions,
And could not, or would not, speak to their
motions, ,
This tried him while in the chair of the
Speaker,
So that, since, his hold on life has been
weaker.
The Opposition, too, was a thorn in his
side
Their foolish self-seeking, presumption, and
pride.
So that, troin causes many and various
His health has been for some time precarious.
No wonder that he, when his feet began
slipping
From the throne of his power, should find
his eyes dripping
With the wilful tears that would steal from
their lashes
At thought of the six Ministerial crashes.
Hdd he remained in his mercantile world,
From that Treasury Bench he ne'er had
been hurled,
Nor would he be lying beneath this old
willow
With a volume of "" Hansard"" to serve as his
pillow.
Since his fall from the House here Ellis has
rested,
A man of good parts, who passed nothing
untested ;
So, when he was there, he sat in his chair,
Aud everything measured by line and by
square.
Of gentlest bearing, he never would snub
us,
And yet he was always ready to "" club"" us.
Here Riddell retires at the close of his day :
Though youthful, with worry his head has
turned grey.
He had a good memory-as clear as a
crystal
With a voice that was not as true as a
pistol ;
Which shot its sound down when it should
have been raised,
And loudly condemned where it ought to
have praised.
The bent of his mind, like a typical ferret
(And this, by the way, was his principal
merit)
Sought out facts to drag to justice laud
schemers,
To flash his new light in the eyes of old
dreamers ;
Besides, he always maintained his defences
By trying to startle us out of our senses
By a tremendous din and a clatter,
When anything extra great was the matter.
Still, some of his facts were very enriching,
And some of his figures very bewitching.
He had his friends, and many a troublesome

WHIST, sir! Would ye plaze to speak aisy
And sit ye down there by the dure!
She sleeps, sir, so light and so restless,
She hears every step on the flure.

For months, and the heat dhrires her wild;
The summer has wasted and worn her
Till she's only the ghost of a child.
All I have 7 Tea. she Is, and God help me!

Aa party as iver yon see, sir,
Bat wan by wan dhrooped like, and died.
What was it that tuk them, ye're asking t
Why poTerty, sure, and no doubt!
They perished for food and fresh air, air,
like flowers dhried up in a drought.
It was dreadful to loose them ? Ah, was it!
It seemed like my heart-strings would break.
But there's days when wid want and wid sorrow
I'm thankful they're gone-for their sake!
Their father t Well, sir, saints forgiTe me!
It's a foul tongue that lowers its own t
But what wid the sthrikes and the liquor.

Do I want to keep this want Thedarllat,

O darHnt, why couldn't you wait!
Dead! dead! an' the help in the dureway I
Too late! omy baby. Too late!
How avd Whih to Dnri.—Take your
meals regularly: do not dine at 2 p.m. to-day,
and 7 p.m. to-morrow, and 4 p.m. the day after)
bat fix tome stated hour} and, for the
workers, I should My that from 6 to half-past 6
v a good and serviceable hoar. Dining late is,
as a rule, preferable to mid-day dinners, for
dinner ooght to be the principal meal of the
day, and, to be enjoyed a* well as digested,
admits of neither harry nor interference. The
work of the day shonld be over; and a long
rest, followed by light occupation before bed
time, will be singularly conducive to health as
well as happiness. If you are to ignore the art
of dining, you may as well repudiate at once the
art of living and working, for rest assured that,
unless you dine with judgment; you will not be
able to calculate with foresight; and, just for
the lac| of a little gastronomical knowledge, you
may be a bankrupt. Is there not the old story
quoted by everybody who baa written on food
and digestion—namely, that the first Napoleon
lost the battle of Leipsic from eating a badly
cooked mutton chop? He died of eanoer of
the stomach. I do not say that this was
brought on by hit hastily-snatched, half-masti
cated cutlets and chickens» but if we allow
that a man has a predisposition to malignant
disease, is it unlikely that the most ill-treated
organ should be attacked by the disease P Be
careful as to the character of your food—your
imports let us call them i let them be nourish*
ing, digestible, and judiciously cooked j for if
these three qualities are combined, you will
include a fourth—namely, that they shall be
palatable. It is easy enough to tell you what is
nourishing; those household words, beef and
mutton, imply a multitude of dishes that shall
nobly support life, and rarely fail to please the
palate. Possibly you may reply, ""That's
notbiug new t anybody could have told us to eat
beef and mutton i »c have been eating it all
our lives."" True, jou have done so, but as un
conscious of it* merits as te bourgeois gentU*
homme was of his conversation being prose
"" Five la prose ! il y a quaranU an* que je
parle la prose."" It may be that you hare been
eating beef for forty years, fad yet you may be
even now profoundly ignorant of its full merits
and capabilities. You bare not always eaten it
with judgment; you have eaten it tough,
perhaps, or with the juioes of the meat ex*
traded, or with greasy accessories that do not
harmonise with* either the meat itself or the
consumer thereof. Perhaps you have, with un
flinching fidelity, stuck to the same joints,
scorning any change to interest the stomach or
stimulate the appetite | so that familiarity with
these household words has bred contempt.
Study variety, or let your cook do so, if she has
brains (I do not write for those who keep a
male chef de cuisine) ; if your cook lacks intel
ligence, let your wife come to the rescue; for,
in common courtesy we will admit that she, at
any rate, is gifted with theso organs of thought.
There v a general idea prevalent that all beef is
pretty much of a muchness, more often tough
than tender, instilling us with the belief that •
bullock is an animal possessed of ribs which
admit of mysterious rolling, and of a part which
is liberal enough to supply us with steaks for
the usual accessories of onions or oysters. But
remember, il y a de* pommes et de* pommes,
there are bullocks and bullocks, beef and beef,
of varying qualities.— Food Journal.
The Old Woman nr thb WofiKSOuai. —It
was while walking down a dismal ward—the
ward appropriated to bedriddoa inmates—that
our attention was arrested by a very old woman,
lying flat on her back, and looking drearily
round the room and up to the whitewashed
ceiling with a pair of fine melancholy blue
eyes, those eyes which yet preserve their youth
when the other features are withered up with
time. On being asked if she would not like to
read | ""Yes ma'am,"" she said, ""if I had any
spectacles."" So for want of spectacles this old
woman was allowed to lie doing absolutely
nothing from month to month. We sat down
and began to talk to her. She had been a
' household servant in LadyBBee family •
had married, and had lived till lately with an
old husband, long paralytic. Then he died.
We asked her how they got on in their age and
weakness. "" I kep htm,"" says the old woman j
her blue eyes flashed with a fierce, wifely fire,
as though she said, ""do you suppose I would
let him come here ?"" Then we heard a long
story told with minute garrulity • how the old
husband died, and she went on living by herself
in her little room, doing such small chars as
might keep her few wants supplied} till one
evening, after tea, she mounted on a ohair, and
tried to lift the tray covered with tea things on
an upper shelf, and overbalancing, fell, ohair,
tray, and frail old human body; and they
brought her to the workhouse with a broken
bone, and at seventy-seven she would never
rise again. Already she had been there
eighteen months, gazing up at the
workhouse ceiling, without spectacles and
without books—this respectable household
servant of Lady Be. We asked if she
would like something to read. ""Oh!""
said the old woman eagerly. ""And what
books?"" ""I was a Catholic"" said the old
woman, with a contrite pathos quite inde
scribable. The next day she had a pair of
strong spectacles, and a volume of Father
Faber's hymns, and the expression in those old
blue eyes will never be forgotten to the giver's
dying day. Since then the workhouse cripple
has gone to her tttt.—Englishwoman's Journal.
Pbbkatubi Adtkotssmbhtb. —One is get
ting used to the piling up of names in matrimo
nial advertisements. When Mr Brown has the
felicity of marrying Miss Jones, the announce
ment of the fact is pretty certain to include the
names of father, grandfather, and any titled rela
tives of the bridegroom and the bride, and
those of all the clergymen officiant or assistant,
with all such other details of pedigree or sta
tion as may be deemed attractive to the public
eye. Of late this custom has extended, in some
cases we hare noticed, from the marriages to
the births, and there have been protruded an
nouncements such as this: —"" On the 11th in
stant, at Amelia Augusta, wife of Timothy
Twaddle, Esq., /.P., F.UJZ 8., &0., to., of a
son [Augustus Timothy]."" Now, Mrs. Chrundy,
please ma'am, what imports the nomination of
this infant? Clearly the little bantling was not
born ready-christened; and viewing the celerity
with which his birth has been announced, it is
hardly likely that he has been yet presented at
the font. I'he proclamation of tne Christian
names which are to be applied to him must be
therefore premature, and of nominal impor
tance. Friends at a distance, who might be ex
pected to accept the intimation, and to express
congratulation, or, if cynical, condolence, could
hardly be expected to recite the welcome little
stranger's names in their letters to his parents,
and say they hoped to hear that Master Timothy
Augustus was in tolerable health. For months
that little gentleman will be called baby by his
nurse, and probably addressed by his Mamma
as a "" pooty dueksy wucksy,"" or a "" tiddy iokle

cruiser in Farm Cove recently, and though
somewhat accustomed to strange noises pecu
liar to such craft, I was much disturbed In
mind and nerve on account of a clattering and a
banging which was wafted from the half-deck
one day. Clatter-bang-clash it went. I in
quired of my friend and guide. ""Oh, that's the
wireless telegraph machine, don't you know,""
he said. I didn't know, and tried to find out,
but was informed that the operating-room was
one of the spots that visitors must avoid. Nev
ertheless, I ascertained later that not very long
ago a cruiser was coming down the-coast from
the north and hadn't ""tuned"" up the machine.
Result rather amusing. Another cruiser was
trying to ""speak with her,"" and the operator
kept on asking ""Indicate your position."" No
answer came for hours, but at last he must have
struck the right chord, for the reply was ""eth
ered"" thus:-""At so-and-so buoy In Farm Cove.""
The other chap thought the ship was in the

""X. O.:"" Tributing has\a risky as well as a
financial side. A rich mine that has reached
the worked-out stage is where tributers take
risks. One form of tributing is ""running the
Stulls."" In working a reef of moderate size a
certain amount of mullock is shot out to make
working room. The method of disposing of
this mullock is to throw it down behind against
timbers erected to form a barrier over the level
from which the reef is being worked. These
timbers are known as Stull props, and the
Stulls are the packed up mullock behind the
stopes. In older times, when an ounce, or
even two ounces, to the ton didn't pay much,
small and then inferior pay stuff found its way
into the stulls, and it is after this pay stuff
the stull-running trlbuter goes. Just conceive
a subterranean chamber 100ft in length and
breadth, and anything from 4ft upwrds In
height. The chamber runs up at an angle of
say, 45deg or over. Its contents are a mass of
rubble and boulders, and timber. The timber
has been there for ten or fifteen years, and
much of it has rotted, or has been split or
crushed to fragments owing to the hang
ing-wall (the roof of the stopes) coming
down. Tributers will pay a proportion
of the gold won for the right to
loosen-out, ""run,"" the contents of this semi
vortlcal chamber. At times it may be neces
sary to go up and put a shot in to loosen the
debris; at others the rubble and boulders come
with a rush, blocking up the level for many
yards, and supplying a good week's trucking.
? The only thing above ground writer has seen
to compare with a rush of mullock when ""run
ning stulls"" ls a seven-storey wall that crash
ed out into the street during a big Are. With
every fall clouds of dust rise, and the labour of
trucking ls arduous. And all for-perhaps a
net result of 10s a week-perhaps ten times
as much. Life and limb are big stakes to play
against such paltry winnings.

RINGS OF BLUE.
In easy chair my father sits,
And Nell is at his knee,
While mother clears the things away
And tidies after tea;
And little Jack, the daddy's pet,
Runs quickly from the room
To pluck a cleaner for the pipe
From mother's kitchen broom.
The lamp is held, the cloth is on--
'The circle is complete,
With ""Jockey Jack"" on father's knee,
And Nell at mother's feet.
""Some rings,"" we cry, ""some pretty rings,
Please, dear old daddy, do;
Just like you made the other night,
Some pretty rings of blue.""
And father, bless his kindly heart,
To please the merry school,
Puffs loud and fast to gather steam,
Then takes a mighty pull,
And makes a funny ""button"" mouth,
And softly whispers ""Woo!""
As, forth on fairy wings, they fly,
Those pretty rings of blue.
And how we shout and dance in glee,
And chase them round the chair
Out past the lamp to wear them all,
As bangles of the air.
And happy, too, is he, the king
Of all our hearts so true;
When seated in his easy chair,
He blows the rings 0f blue.

""Oliver:"" I remember some months ago read
ing in ""T. and C."" how the city professional
cyclist and the country travelling cyclist are
paid. The former wins a race. As the re
sult of a mile spurt he nets anything up to
a hundred pounds, and is a little tin god. The
other pushes his machine all over the conti
nent, either on business or looking for work.
Nature has been rather bounteous in placing
(literally) thorns in the path of the.buBh cy
clist. I have cycled in Queensland and the
bindeii is a pest. I have cycled all over New
South Wales, and the ""Bogan flea"" and vari
ous cacti are met with. In Victoria box thorn
hedges are numerous, and I have on more than
one occasion walked five or six miles. Here in
West Australia sand and ""double G."" are the
cyclist's horrors. Have just walked five miles
into Geraldton, result of a puncture. ""Double
G.'s"" are small seeds about a quarter of an inch
long; and with three very sharp and strong
thorns. They possess the merit, or demerit, of
always having one thorn pointing heavenward,
no matter how it is thrown on the ground. An
ingenious squatter in the very early days Im
ported the ""double G."" from the Cape, and he
sowed it all round his homestead, in order to
keep the blacks away. This is the Scots and
the Danes over again, and as the thistle has
spread so has the ""double G.,' and now lt is
spreading all over W.A. But the sand is the
cyclist's nightmare. I biked about 160 miles
last week, but carried the bike on my back for
miles and miles.

""E. P.:"" It is a pity that somebody with
money, leisure, and a taste for archaeological
research does not make an effort to solve the
origin of the mysterious rock paintings in the
north-west portion of this, continent. Any
body who glances at Australian history knows
that they were first discovered by Sir George
Grey in 1838. Ever since then they have ex
cited the wonder and curiosity of both scien
tific and unscientific people, but all have failed
alike, to And a plausible explanation as to how
the naked nomads of this secluded corner of
the continent came to be acquainted with the
sleeved garments of civilisation. In 1901, the
spot was again revisited, and some photo

1837-39.)
graphs taken of these remarkable paintings.
Grey's copies are evidently slightly idealised,
the fault of memory, doubtless; and aro far
more symmetrically designed than the repre
sentations of the too faithful camera; but in
essence they are the same. The trite explan
ation is, of course, that Chinese or Malays have
at some forgotten time landed on the north
coaBt or been shipwrecked tb are. Thence
the inspiration. But this in no way cKplp.'n'j
all the details. The halos or turbans r >unJ
the heads are as strange aB the fact that the
figures are all oyekss. These paintings are
strictly local, and apparently have not spread
beyond tho Immediate district where was first
drawn the original painting, from which those
copies have been made. If the original could
bo found, we ought not to have much trouble
in deciding as to whose work lt was-Asiatic
or European. These paintings are generally
drawn in sheltered spots, and regarded with
somo degreo of veneration by the natives; at
least, as much veneration as one can beliove
the Australian native capable of. The situ
ation reminds one of a shrine to somo saint,
or even the Madonna. This, together with the
halo and robe, ls very suggestive of a medioval
picture. Perhaps some monk of the fifteenth
century cast away during the voyage to the
Philippines, found here a final home, and spent
his years of exile in trying to convert the
heathen by means of the rude arts of those
times, chief amongst which was the use of
holy pictures, etc. His savage pupils after
wards tried to perpetuate his original doslgn
by oopieB, mixed with a little of their own
art. The colours UBed are, according to Mr.
Brockman, the surveyor, who rediscovered and
photographed the paintings, durable, and when
sheltered aro weatherproof. The district
where tho rock paintings oxlst, at least these
particular onos, ls not large, but rough; and
at present, unsettled; so that a vory caroful
search, coupled with tho assistance of the
natives, might reveal the fact of a landing on
Australia a hundred years bofore Commander
Willem Jams, of the Duyfken, paid us a visit.

SONG.
THE SEAMAN'S ADIEU.
---
I.
ADIEU--adieu, my dearest,
My barque is in the bay,
And the cannon that thou hearest,
Forbids my longer stay.
II.
My sails aro loos'd on high, love--
My anchor is a-peak
My pennant fills the sky, love,
Yet a tear is on thy cheek.
III.
Oh! do not--do not weep, love,
The whirlwinds of the sea
Will slumber while I sleep, love,
With joyous dreams of thee!
IV.
To burning climes I roam, love
But wherever I may roam,
My heart still doats on home, love,
My hallow'd hearth and home,
V.
Our cottage by the mountain,
Our garden and each tree,
Our grotto and its fountain,
Have a thousand charms to me.
VI.
But dearer--dearer far, love.
Than May-bud to the bee,
Than to the moth the star, love,
Art thou, fond girl, to me.
VII.
Then cease to weep, my dearest,
Nor grieve because we part,
The danger which thou fearest
Brings rapture to my heart.
VIII.
'Tis joy to cleave the billow,
With more than falcon speed,
With my ""light barque"" for my pillow,
My castle, and my steed.
IX.
Adieu--adieu, my kind one,
Again--again, adieu--
Tho' I roam I ne'er shall find one
So loved, so fond as you.

I CAN build another fire, if the fire goes out;
I can find another watercourse, if this runs dry;
I can always make a damper if 1 have a little flour;
I can alwavs find a Darrot or a pigeon for a pie.
And I tell her of the luxuries we'll share some day, .
When I've won the golden fortune that I know I'm

S.G. MEE.
ALL nature faints this weary noon;
Shrill as the sound before a swoon,
Rings out the locusts dizzy tune.
Hither, my dog! we now are free;
Our flock is circling'neath yon tree;
And this our noonday Rest shall be.
What! thy fond paw upon my breast!
Well, well—thou lov'st me!—let it rest:
With such affection all were blest!
And shall such Feeilng unpass'd be,
O friend, so faithful and so free ?—
Thy heart's pulsations all for me !
Not so:—Thy kindly eye doth move
An artless song, though mean it prove:
Few lines are lasting as thy love!
Thine was no lot 'midst wealth or state ;
Nor would thou it had been thy fate
To bark beside some lordly gate.
A bushman, on a sorry hack;
A wight whose wealth's slung at his back;
Such men will ne'er thy friendship lack.
With voice clear as a dinner-bell,
Thou wagg'st the wand'rer to our cell;
Saint Bernard, sure, had lov'd thee well!
Nor be thy shepherd-skill unsung:
A swifter foot or merrier tongue
Never o'er mountain raced or rung.
Like barques smooth-gliding o'er a sea;
Beeming apart as stars to be;
Yon host of gleaming fleeces see!
""Forward!"" From hill and mountain brow
Converging, fly they from him now,
Like billows from a vessel's prow.
Yet not from fear:—yon ""ration"" wright
Tosses his buttocks in his flight
With a contemptuous delight:
Stops—looks around him with disdain ;
Regards with scorn the flying train ;
Bobs, pirouettes—then off again!
Ah mind I well the doleful day
He led (no doubt with spirits gay)
That poor misguided mob away
Allured them o'er the mountain-pass
To find, beyond that dank morass,
An El Dorado of "" burnt grass!""
O silly race of selfish rams
Saw I, in dreams, your bleeding dams;
Behold ye, lacerated lambs!
Scarce climb the sun the mountain's side,
Again that rueful yard I eyed;
I called thee then—no voice replied!
"" Thou recreant too!"" ah woe was me!
Three hawks flew from a distant tree;
And th' wild dogs howled, dismally.
(Yet no upbraidings did impend,
However now my search might end,
From him —the luckless shepherd's friend).
With weary heart, and wearier feet,
Far, far beyond th' custom'd beat,
I traced when,lo! I heard a bleat!
Saw something whits afar!—"" a log ""
A dwarf bush gleaming 'midst the fog!""—
Ha! ha!—My own!—my gallant dog!
Thy graceful tail I might espy,
Waving like warrior's plume on high!
And rang thy bark full merrily:
And there the rebel lambkins lay,
Shimmering in the morning's spray,
Like nebula in a Milky Way
The red-coat dingoes full in sight! -
Else many a ewe had been unblest;
Lambs vainly many an odder prest;
And th' world lost many a coat and vest.
Brave sentinel! thy matchless skill
Shall shine in unborn tailor's bill:
Thy doughty deeds a tome would fill!
Thy ""instinct"" is a tome to me;
And oft I wonder, wherefore we
Ignore thy immortality :
For I thy love, so changeless, scan;
Find I its counterpart in man ?
Truth cannot; fiction scarcely can.
There as I hold thy paw and read,
I from a spacious world secede,
And love, at least, the Indian's creed.
But, see! yon circle spreads away;
Come - ever ready at thy play!—
I'll tell of thee some future day.

Though with his laurels we have twined the yew,

What purpose dwellefh 'neath that silent gaze ?
What mighty forecast loometh through the haze
Of thy life's future ? Doth thy soul's insight
Bêar thee where, 'mid the battle's fiercest fight,

Above the senate's hum, their shouts, to praise _
Thy eloquence that pleads their country's right ?

I^HE silver clouds of summer time
x Go sailing out to-day
As perfect as a perfect rhyme,
In balanced flight they sway
Slowly across an infinite blue bay.
Seeking a pearly haven on
The far horizon's lee,
Serenely on to Avalon,
Or golden Arcady,
Some perilous port of faery gramarye.
Unlike the ships that, up and down,
Must follow through the foam,
The long sea miles to London Town,
Tlie many roads to Rome,
They trust no anchored star to steer
them home.
They leave no watery path or wake
Behind their sagging rails,
No snowy foam-bells suige and break
Where each blunt bow assails
The unfathomed blueness of those
skyey trails.
Oh, toppling galleons of cloud,
It surely seems to me
You sail beneath, each stately proud
Adventurous Argosy,
Sealed orders, to be opened out at sea.
The stars swing out like masthead
lights
On anchored ships at rest;
But cloud-land's ships that dared the
heights
Of that uncertain quest,
Lie wrecked on the red barrier of the
west.
KATHLEEN DALZIEL.
A star, low-mirrored in a muddy pool,
Weaves magic on the waters.
Mud and slime and ugliness become
A silver home for quivering loveliness.
For even unclean things
Grasp greedily when beauty conde-
scends.
But far above, higher than 'thought,
The star burns on,
Wrapped in a shining pride,
Remote, aloof, and all inviolate.

That scarcely moves their branches to and
fro.
The darkness of black opal on the sand
Where, late, the gold noose of the Sun-God
shone;
No glimmering light by sea, no light by land,
No beacon ray to pin one's faith upon.
Not one pale star the midnight vigil keeps;
The starless sea reflects a starless sky;
And a grey breaker, like a grey horse, leaps
To where by North Steyne cold the grey
rocks lie.
Keen sea-salt perfumes through the darkness
steal,
And out at sea strange southern thunders
roll--
Manly deserted! In my heart I feel
The sun-lost weeping of her midnight soul.

LONGFELLOW.
Night's gloomy spell is broken, and the light
Is pale and tender in the waking East;
The sudden sun with splendour sails to sight,
The wailing night-bird's weary note has ceased.
All, all rejoice as day and life return,
Bearing a song of gladness to the hearts
Of weary mortals who in patience yearn
For aught to salve the wounds of Life's fierce darts.
O weary ones, look upward to the Light
That guides our stumbling footsteps to the bourn
Where care-worn hearts are soothed, and where the
night
Is all unknown amidst eternal morn,
Where life shall spring from death, and joy from pain,
And earthly loss shall be a heavenly gain.",The Queenslander ,"901,484,680,540,680,833,834,567,406,494,220,734,641,753,794,611,667,664,866,660,825,899,88,624,900,691",Sat 4 Jun 1892,"427,984,1117,1186,1269,2000,2017,1351,1381,1414,1444,1493,1524,1554,1587,1625,1654,1691,1720,1756,1787,1817,1858,1887,1920,1950","427,639,537,613,537,466,466,595,597,597,1079,433,466,433,466,433,465,433,466,433,460,433,498,458,433,433",19824480,Page 1073

"" Go it, little ones !"" is. our advice to the four
footers who are waging war so gallantly against
their big brothers, the regulation-height Volun
teers. Is a man's heart to be measured by his
inches, or his courage to be gauged by
the length of his small-clothes Y Cer
tainly not, so many a tall wife can
testify who has chosen her lord as one
who chooses one's cheese or one's sherry-for
quality not quantity Under the present standard,
Napoleon himself would be disqualified, and there
may be many Napoleons amongst our small
friends, only awaiting the day and the hour to
prove themselves the men. Especially for riflemen
does the disqualification of insufficient inches
seem absurd, if the distinction may not be
said to be all in their favour. Didn't
David ""pot"" Goliath?' and even given j
equal accuracy of aim, it must be
harder to hit a little hop-o'-my-thumb fellow, who
could ""cover"" easily behind a well-grown cabbage,
than a great hulking grenadier, as good a mark as
a haystack. Let our little friends stick up for
their rights as men, not monkeys, and at least de
mand to be formed into a special corps, to be
called, say, the Tom Thumbs, the Martial Manni
kins, or the Great Invisibles !
Saturday night ended tho opera season proper, to
be supplemented, however, thanks to tho pluck of
"" the enterprising lessee,"" by twenty-four nights
more of song, for which, doubtless, tho public
will bo duly grateful. Notwithstanding the
croakers, tho season we are glad to hear, has
been in every sense a genuine success. Finan
cially, we understand, the management are quite'
satisfied, and if tho music-loving public are some
what less so, the fault is mainly with themselves.
We have it on the authority of one of the leading
members of the company, that to sing in the stuffy,
dust-laden atmosphere of the old Vic, is some
thing very nearly equivalent to asphyxia in a
pepper-mill. In some of his tenderest scenes
when he ought to have been sighing his very soul
out in flute-like melody, he has with the
greatest difficulty saved himself from fright
ening the prima donna into fits by half
sneezing his head off, while some of his
finest bravura passages have been utterly ruined
by a sudden sensation in tho thorax, for all the
world as if ho had swallowed the cayenne pepper
bottle. This superfluity of dust in one depart
ment of the theatre, however, is of course no
reason why the public should not come down
with their dust as handsomely as ever in another.
The programme for the extra season is a splendid
one, if the theatre itself is a bad one, that is all
the stronger reason why the public should liber
ally second the energetic efforts of the manager to
make tho very best of it.
The wisdom of Solomon, we are afraid, does
not often pervade the magisterial decisions ]
at our Police Courts, but it seems to have
been much needed on Thursday, when a case
of disputed identity occurred that might have
puzzled the wise monarch himself satisfactorily
to decide. It was a case not of baby against baby,
nor of butcher against baronet, but of Pompey
against Prince-the rival claimants being twp
somewhat excited individuals named respectively
Burling and Twemlow, and the interesting subject
in dispute, that frequent cause of strife and back
biting, a ""dawg."" Burling had an unfading
remembrance of a canine mend named Pom
pey, but had lost sight of him for some thirteen
months, when he found him cheerfully trotting after
a new master, and answering to a new name,
Prince. A claim to Pompey was met by a counter
claim to Prince, and several witnesses -were called
to prove ou tho one side that the sham Prince was
the real Pompey, and on the other that Prince had
been Prince from the days of his earliest puppy
dom. The simplest way to have settled the
matter, would probably have been to ask the clog ;
but theirworshipswere not equal to this exercise of
common-sense, and after the changes had been
rung for an hour or more on Pompey and Prince,
Prince and Pompey, decided in favour of Pompey,
on the principle, apparently, of that generous
British justice that always takes the weaker side.
The Prince of one day is, ' therefore, the Pompey of
next day, and it is to be hoped will know himself
under his new name, as he is scarcely likely to
know his now master.
5 {Usually the Bar is the preliminary stage, the
stepping-stone to tho Bench, but Mr. ex-District
Court Judge Simpson has resolved to reverse the
natural order of things, and gracefully descend
from the Bench to the Bar. This latent decision
of the learned ex-Judge, like many previous ones,
shows «. pood deal of originality, and not a little
pluck. To be sure the Bench to be abandoned was
only the District Court, Bench, about which there
was a finality that to a man of ability and fair
ambition might well appear unsatisfactory. But
on the other hand, on the same snug judicial seat,
there was also a certainty which our
learned friend - the "" hedging "" proviso of
the Crown Prosecutorship notwithstanding-must
be content to miss. However, there is no doubt
ample room and verge enough for the learned
gentleman's energies in the fair field of the Courts,
where we hope ho will often figuro to his own and
others' advantage. Moreover, there is a good pre
cedent in point. The present Attorney-General
also relinquished tho ermine (figuratively speak
ing) for the bombazine, and what Mr. Innes lias
done there can surely be no reason why Mr. Simp
son should not dare to do. At any rate, in the
whole history of the bar, there probably never was
a time when the demand, for even
ordinary talent, was greater, or where j
to fair industry and ability there was a surer
chance of many a fat oyster. If we were attorneys,
Mr. Simpson should share with us our first and
fattest, if only for his pluck. As we don't happen
to have that honour, he has, less nourishing, per
haps, but quite as hearty, our best wishes.
To any one. who, like ourselves, heard Dr.
Vaughan on Sunday night for the first time, one
thing must have been very apparent-the infinite
power of words artistically treated at the hands of
a master. Dr. Vaughan is an orator, so far as
great natural advantages of voice and presence
and consummate art can make him one ; and his
"" oration"" on Sunday hight was eloquent'ond im
pressive, so far as a mere wonderful outpouring
of words, "" only that and nothing more,"" can be
said to be either. If we say that it was nothing
more, that, to us at least, its excellence as a piece
of brilliant declamation was only equalled in
degree by its intellectual feebleness, we shah
probably be set down in certain quarters as gross
heathens, alike in taste and in creed-as, if tho
ßomnn Catholic Archbishop on the altar
steps of St. Mary's be the truest type of
both, we no doubt are ; still, it must
be said that delightful as it was to listen« to so
eloquent a master of ""pure English undefiled,""
and to watch tho noble face and form: both
instinct-there could be no doubt about that, how
ever one might differ as to the occasion-with a
divine enthusiasm, we should have liked it very
much better had the gifted orator, intellectually
speaking, had anything to say. Possibly we ex
pected too much. Perhaps it was not to be sup
posed that in dealing with what is to our minds
one of the grossest delusions of this or any other
age, a Roman Catholic Archbishop could be other
wise than tender. However that may be, we wero
certainly disappointed in the matter of the lecture,
in common, we have no doubt, with a good half
of the vast crowd who had responded to his
Lordship's advertisement. Tho popular impression
certainly was that a lecture by Dr. Vaughan on
""Visions and Revelations,"" meant a lecture on
Spiritualism, in its modern development ; and
this, with the fame of the lecturer,
would have been quite enough to cram even a
larger building than the temporary cathedral with
an eager audience. Hut the popular impression
was wrong. Dr. Vaughan fought as shy of tho
spirits, good, bad, or indifferent, as the "" good St.
Anthony"" of the "" devils short and devils tall""in
the ballad ; and, instead of a lecture on modern
Spiritualism, we were treated to a sermon on the
Roman Catholic"" Science of Mystical Theology ""of
which the chief recommendation seemed to bo
that it was as abstruse almost as alcbymy, only
the initiated being able to compass its mysteries,
and as old almost as astrology. Wo shali go and
hear Dr. Vaughan again. He is the most eloquent
of all our public preachers and teachers, and
facile princeps, tho primo tenore of our cloricnl
stage But it is no more the true eloquence that
moves the hearts or convinces the heads of men
than the concert solos, before and after his ser
mon, were genuine devotion.
Our poor patient, persecuted Premier has had
another blow. The malice of his enemies pursues
him even into the recess. When the tongue of
Parliamentary detraction is tied, the Press takes
up the ciy, and the Herald, hard up for readable,
matter, re-hashes the howls and libels of the Op
position. ""To what base uses may we come,
Horatio !"" when not even the Premier of tho
country, tho immaculate Minister ! of and for tho
people, is made the subject for a hack writer to
blunt his quill upon, and earn his dinner withal.
So Mr. Parkes, injured in his tenderest part, his
hatred of anything like trickery or treachery,
makes mild complaint in the Herald yesterday,
He has been charged, it seems, in that journal, with
conduct, at which hiß whole noble soul revolts.
He has been accused of making a violent personal
attack upon an opponent, (Mr. Robertson), and then
of walking out of the House and conniving at a
count out. Did he, could he, ever be guilty of
anything of the kind? Was he ever known to
say an unkind or abusive word of any one P And
has not every act of his life been as clear and as
clean for any one's inspection as-well, as his hon!
friend's ""waters of oblivion""-in which, by the
way, he thinks it would do the editor of the
Herald no harm to be sunk fathoms deep. It is
impossible not to sympathise with the hon. gen
tleman, as one would with any other ill-used
creature whose "" raws "" are being perpetually
touched up. But Mr. Parkes has, at least, the con
solation of much fellowship of woe.. He is not
the only unhappy man by many hundreds of rash
misguided individuals, whom the reading of, or
attempt to read, a Herald leading article hos made
sick. ^
The imposing-looking gentleman in the black
wide-awake, with gold tassel, to whom the faith
ful touch their hats as Archbishop Coadjutor, is
not only evidently wide-awake himself, but seems
to have a quiet but most effective way of doing
things that must be eminently satisfactory to those
whom it concerns. With the internal organisa-.
tion of any of our several religious establishments,
we have, of course, little or nothing to do ; but it
is curious, in this case, to notice how vigorously
a now broom can sweop, even when it
might have been supposed that the resistance
to anything like healthy renovation, would have
been strongest. Thus Dr. Vaughan had no soonor
recovered his land-legs and taken the edge oil' his
polemical appetite by a short bout with his
Protestant Lordship of Sydney, than ho mado a
clean sweep of St, Mary's, and the places if
reverend and very reverend gentlemen, who.«
names had been household words for a generation,
Jcnow them no more. Then we heard that til«)
most reverend, fcc, &c, had taken ui»
his abode at St. John's College, much to
the patriotic wrath of Mr. John Stewart,
who at once wanted to know how many
more bishops the country was going to board and
lodge. It was explained that Dr. Vaughan was, in
his new quarters, simply as the guest of the
rector, Dr. Forrest, who, with his one student,
found life in this vast vacuum somewhat lonely.
But there are guests as dangerous as a cuckoo va.
a thrush's nest, and wo cannot say that we were
surprised to read in Saturday's papers, that Dr.
Forrest has resigned, and that Dr. Vaughan
reigns in his stead. It is certainly time
that St. John's College should have something more
to show for the money it has cost and still costs
the State, than the "" one student"" who has so long
vexed the soul of Mr, Stewart and a well-fe.l
Rector. Dr. Vaughan will probably be scarcely a i
good a "" chaw"" in the lecture-room at St. John's 11
e appears to be in the pulpit at St. Mary's, buth >
will, doubtless, give tho "" one student"" some com
panions, and so fardo tho State some service,th 1.
it will at least get something for its money. A .

CANTO THE THIRD
All the world's a stage,--
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits, and their entrances,
And one man in his day plays many parts.""
SHAKSPERE.
""All these, and more, came flocking.""
MILTON.
""Whoop--off they go; haloo they shout--they fly!
They spur--they whip--they crack!""
TENNANT.
The season was over--the Play-house was closed,--
And the actors from labours to please us reposed;
Bade adieu, for a time, to their play books and dresses,
And ceased for a little to please or distress us;
Descended to earth from the ""heaven of invention,""
No longer attracted the public attention,
But shrunk into common-place creatures of clay,
And wore the unclassical garb of the day.
The hero of yesterday, hot from the fight,
Is cooling his parched throat at Wyatt's to-night;
And Richard and Hamlet are smoking their pipes,
And Shylock sips Cadell's Australian swipes,--
And Tragedy's features, enveloped in smoke,
Relax from their sternness, and join in the joke
With Simes and his brethren, whose looks seem to say--
""As we journey through life, let us live by the way.""
II.
And Pitt-street felt the change;--no more
Were gathered round the theatre door
The crowds of idle men, and women,
Mechanics, artizans, and seamen,
And ragged boys, with roguish faces,
Who used, with mischief and grimaces,
On acting nights to smoke and prate,
And swarm around the outer gate;
Like bees, that when the skies are sunny,
Group round their hives with loads of honey
But, when the summer season's o'er,
Pursue their busy tasks no more.
III.
The gin-shops felt the change and sighed;
For though their ample ports stood wide,
And all, with open arms, invited
To walk within, and be delighted
With all that pleasure can supply,
To tempt the taste, or charm the eye;--
Few, few responded to thr call:
Was heard no more the midnight brawl;
Was seen no more the bully's swagger;
The drunkard had forgot to stagger,
And, wakened from his maniac dream,
Had ceased his Maker to blaspheme:
The star of Peace, with aspect mild,
On the fair prospect looked and smiled;
The desert showed one spot of green;--
Oh! who would wish to change the scene?
IV.
But other actors were in training,
To break the calm that then was reigning;
And many a man, who ne'er before
Had crossed the hated Play-house door;
Nor listened to its Syren song,
So pleasing to the giddy throng;
Nor viewed the actor's mimic art,
So grateful to the listless heart,
Were striving now, with might and main,
To deck themselves in trappings vain,
And tread the very Thespian board
Which heretofore they so abhorred;
And be the very thing their eyes,
Erewhile, pretended to despise.
Oh! man, thou riddle of creation,
Whate'er thy taleuts, wealth, or station,
Who canst, without a reason, blame
The actor's dubious path to fame,
And yet, inconstant as the breeze,
Thyself pursue that path to please;
Will not the world thy changes mock,
Thou animated weather-cock!
Yes! and the world, in man's despite,
Has been, and ever will be, right.
V.
Strange that our eyes, which love to scan
The failings of our fellow-man,
And sift his actions, and pretend
His very thoughts to comprehend,
Should be so blind to see--so slow
Our failings or ourselves to know:
Yet so it is; we strive to smother
The deeds of our deserving brother;
And should his fancy haply choose
To pay addresses to the Muse,
Or cultivate the arts polite,
And pictures paint--or poems write,
Or do whate'er excels us quite;
That instant, with malicious grin,
In thoughts by day, and dreams by night,
A lurking Devil moves within;
The same that stirred the Tempter's mind,
Against the mother of mankind,
And caused the fall, and brought disgrace
And death to all the human race;
And still survives on earth the same,
For Envy is the Demon's name;
And still delights to break our rest
And agitate our jealous breast,
And turn to vinegar and gall
The milk of kindness in our soul;
And oft, in falsehood's cause enlisted,
Discovers faults that ne'er existed.
Oh! that we were so Argus-eyed,
To see ourselves as others see;
How quickly would our selfish pride
Be changed to meek humility!
VI.
'Tis like the tale we early learned
""The lawyer, or the tables turned.""
A curate to a lawyer went,
To lay before him his complaint;
The lawyer's bull, I know not how,
Had killed the humble curate's cow;
But by mistake (the story goes,
And puts its finger to its nose),
By some mistake, the curate said
It was the lawyer's cow was dead.
The man of law waxed wroth, and swore
The curate should the loss restore.
""Think of my wife--my children all--
My outlay great--my income small--""
The curate urged, ""who could prevent
So unforeseen an accident?
Be merciful I pray--forget
The sad mischance--remit the debt;
And Heaven will bless you while you live,
For it is heavenly to forgive.""
""Zounds! Sir, forgive?--remit?--absurd!
I'm busy;--nay, Sir, not a word;
My cow is killed,--in broil or battle,
By one of your misgoverned cattle;
The money must be paid in full,
Or, in exchange, give up the bull;
That's law, that's justice;--would you more?
Then here's the bill, and there's the door.
""Why, Sir,"" the Curate meek replied,
""I fear unconsciously I've lied;
'Twas very stupid, I avow,
But 'twas your bull that killed my cow.
""Oh! ho!"" the cunning lawyer faltered,
""Why then, of course, the case is altered:
'Tis very true, Sir, I'll allow,
My bull has chanced to kill your cow;
But surely, if your heifers choose
A neighbour's kindness to abuse,
And roam my field in search of pasture
I can't protect them from disaster;
Nay--answer not--nor plead your cause
I must uphold our righteous laws;
Which justly judge when men dispute,
And strike the babbling clients mute;
In browsing on forbidden grass,
Your cow, 'tis clear, committed trespass;
A battle followed--in the fight
Your cow got worsted--'sarved her right.' ""
VII.
O glorious justice! Majesty severe
Shakes her proud curls and sits in judgment here.
The tale's a fable: granted;--but its strain
Conveys a moral palpable and plain;
Which he who runs may read, and lay to heart,
He'll find examples in life's varied mart;
Self is the God to whom we pay our vow,
The golden calf to which all nations bow;
Our dearest friends are sacrificed to mammon,
In friendship's sacred name--but this is gammon.
VIII.
Dissolve my dream,
Resume the theme,
We've trifled all too long;
Will any of the muses deign
To smile upon my song;
And guide my pen,
While once again
To higher flights I rise,
And sing of deeds whose splendour shames
The glories of the skies?
The sun is up that ushers in
The all auspicious day;
And shines from Woolloomooloo's heights
On Sydney's spacious bay:
And gilds the distant mountain tops,
That in the clouds repose;
And o'er the stately vessels' sides
A flood of glory throws:
And decks the woods with radiant hues
Around the fair Domain,
And makes the House of Government
Appear, without a stain,
A marble palace, where the great
And noble might abide,--
Where princes--where our gracious
Victoria might reside.
And down the hills
The trickling rills,

(FROM THE GERMAN OP HEINE.)
Visitors, to tbe Rhineland (says ""Tho Queen"")
must have observed near the shrines of the Bles
83<l Virgin in the various churches numbers of
sinall waxen jmages which are offered by crippled
or suffering devotees, in the faith that they will
bo cured by miraculous power. ""Our Lady of
Kevlcar"" is supposed to possess an extraordinary
gilt of this kind; every year, on the Festival of
; Assumption a long procession goes out from Co
logue, bearing in its train numbers of halt and
I waimea, .who carry those waxen offerings, hop
j ina; through these means to be made whole. The
j poet Heine relates that a boy with whom he
ä studied in the .Franciscan school at Dusseldorf,
itol.l him that he had, been cured of a lame foot
by an offering of the above kind. Many years
after, it chanced that the; two lads were fellow
students at Bonn, when the one referred to by
» Jíoínc reminded him bf the miraculous cure of his
I fot-e, adding earnestly, ""Now I will offer the Holy
Mother a waxen hearL"" Long after, in 1S19, the
poof, walking by the-Rhine, heard the familiar
chant of the Kevlaar procession, and, as it drew
nsar, perceived his schoolfellow among the pil
grims, led by his mother, looking very pale and ill.

This book is like ft garden} just a placo,
Whoso soil prepared, tho tiny seed rcceivoB >
Tho seed springs up a plant, which grows apaoc,
. And flourishes with grcon and teador leaves ;
The plant brings forth tho buds ; and so tho book,
Just like tho plant, must buds of pleasure show.
Which will develop as you f urthor look ;
Watch, then, and seo how fast tho bhoots will growt
Thc buds then open, aud in turn produce
The petals of tho Howers you so inuch love ;
The book shall blossom out with flowers profuso,
Aud source of many a pleasant lesson provo.
Each flower evolves into a beauteous cup,
Catching the dow, and giving forth perfume
That fills tho air with a sweet incouse up,
While from the sun all flowers their tints assume
So should this book bo formed to catch tho dow
Of wit and wisdom, and the mental nose
Should oft inhalf tho inconse, fresh and now,
Prom tinted flowers of Poetry and Proso.
The cup is full of houoy, which tho beo
Delights to sip, as nectar from on high ;
Or carry off into her hive, where she
Feeds the young bees, and stores tho balance by.
III.
So you may sip tho sweets the book contains,
And hive within your brain tho precious food,
And feed your ""young ideas"" with what remains.
After you've had enough to do you good.
At longth tho petals die away and fall,
And iu tho cup tho seeds will ripon inst ;
And when maturo you'll gather large and small,
To sow again in the rich soil at last.
And, when for a result ouco more you look,
You'll find, I trust, your garden is so full
That you must malee another garden book
Before fresh flowers of fancy you can cull.

THE LAST AND PRESENT CENTURIES.-In au
obituary notice of Canon Beadon, the TIMES states
that he took his degree in the first year of the present
century. This is an orror ; his B. A. degreo is dated,
in the list of Oxford graduates, May, 1S0Ö. Now, tho
last century ended, as it appears to mo, on Dee. 31,
1800, and tho present commenced on Jan. 1,1S01.

"" NINE POINTS OP THE LAW.""-Tho following,
which I have met with in an odd corner of an old
magazine, is ingenious. Has it anything to do with
tho abovo saying ?
"" To him that goes to law nine things aro requisite s
1st, a good deal of monoy; 2nd, a good deal of
patience; 3rd, a good cause; 4th, a good attorney;
5th, good counsel ; Gfch, good evidence ; 7th a good
jury; Sth, a good judge; Ufch, good luck.""

SATURDAY AND THE KO Y AT. FAMILY.-Tho follow

worthy, I think, of a corner in "" Sf. and Q."" :

I DEATHS ON OB ASSOCIATED WITH THE STAGS?.
-I do not know whother tko following graphio
account has-been sent to "" N. and Q."" ;
Mus. MONTFORD.-Gay wrote his well-known ballad of
"" Blaek.Eyed Sufran"" upon this celebrated actress, who
was contemporary with Cibber. Alter her retirement from
the stoga, love and the ingratitude of a bosom friend hav
ing deprived her of reason, ehe was placed in a receptacle
for lunatics. Ono day, during a. lucid interval, Bho asked
her attendaut what play was to bo performed that evening,
and was told Hamlet. In this tragedy she had always been
received with rantnre as Ophelia. The recollection struck
her forcibly, and with that onnuing which is so often allied
to insanity, she contrived to'elude the caro of the keepera,
and got to the theatre, where Bho concealed herself till tho
scene in which Ophelia outers in her insane stato. Then
she pushed on tho stage, boforo the Indi* who bod performed
the provious part of tho character could come on, and ex
hibited a moro perfect representation of madness than tho
utmost exertions of mimic art could effect. She was, in
truth, Ophelia horsolf, to the tnnazement of the performers
and to 'tho astonishment of tho audience. Nature having
made this last effort, her vital powers failed her. On going
oil sho exclaimed, "" It is all o vor."" She was immediately
conveyed back to ker place of soouri ty, and, in a fow days
af tor,
I "" like a lily drooping,
Bow'd her hoad and died.""

SHOWEBB OP SULPHUR.-Tho following cutting
from tho London TIMES weather column, June 16,
appears to verify tho account forwarded to Mr.
Picton, and communicated by him to "" N. and Q.,""
of sulphur showers in tho colony of Viotoria :
""During the past wook, after heavy rain, a thin
film of sulphur has boonobsorvod at Windsor, Slough,
J and in tho neighbourhood generally, to settle upon
[ tho súrfaco of rain-water caught in tho butts and
cisterns. The phenomenon at first did not attract
much attention, but being observed on differont oc
casions it has given riso to muoh speculation as to
tho causo of it, thoro hoing no manufactures in 'tho
neighbourhood at all likely to have produced it. It .
has boen suggested that a sulphureous vapour may
have been wafted to this country by tho recent south,
east winds and arrested anddeDosited in tho rain.""

JEWISH PHYSIOGNOMY.--Tho following extract
will furnish an additional note on this subjcot:
""Thero aro ateo two very singular colonies of Jew«
at Cochin. Tko ono set are quito whito in complexion,
and the. other quito black. I was prosont at the
Berrico in a synagogue, and saw tho richly deooratod
rolls of tho books of MOBOS carried round in proces
sion and kissed by tho congregation, after tho law had
boon road by tho Rabbis from a central roading-deBk.""

THE STOUT OF A MAN WHO SOLD HIS SOUL.-AS
long ago as tho year 1839 I road in some magazine* a
story of a man who sold his soul. Ho was to bo a
man by day and a Bkoleton by night, and he was to
lire as long as he could koop tho secretor' the chango,
which of course occurred twice a day. Ho lost his
soul, but ho livod threo hundred years and met with
tho most extraordinary adventures. H any of your
I readers will toll me the namo of the story and where
it is to bo found I shall bo vorv much oblitrod.
i B. B. BETTS.
On Friday a cabman named Joseph Bishop, 'of tho
Glebe, whilst nnder tho influence of drink, was
driving up Brickfield Hill, near Campbell-street, at
a furious rate, whon ho ran into tho back of a
waggonotto that was going up tho hill. Tho cab was
smashed into piooeB, and Bishop thrown violently tb
tho ground. Ho was picked np in an insonsiblo con
dition, bleeding from cuts on his head. The wag-,
gonotto received somo damage, and tho occupants'
woro torribly frightonod. Bishop waa romovod to
tho Infirmary by constable John Saunders. When
consciousness restored ho was taken homo.
Wo have boen shown the gold modal awarded to
International Exhibition. It is indeed a magnificent
trophy; in it aro combined tho massiveness
of idea oí tho English workman, Gallie
delicacy of manipulation, and olassio beauty of
design. The modal, which is of high quality gold,
and weighs fully 3£oz, has on its obverse sido an ex
quisitely drawn representation of the goddess of
Liberty and the words ""République Frangaiso ;"" on
tho reverso appears a herald bearing a scroll,
on which is engraved tho name oí
tho recipient firm. Tho company aro tho
holders of the only gold medal awarded to the
colonies for this branch of industry at Paris, and it
may bo mentioned that they wore also first prizo
medallists at Vienna and Philadelphia.
Tho now time-table just issued by tho railway
authorities, and which came into force on Monday
last, offers no greater facilities for travelling by rail
on Sundays than tho old timc-tablo. Moro inconve
nient hours for trains to start on Sundays could not
bo devised. Tho first train loaves tho Rodfern station
at half-past 8 in tho morning-just about tho orthodox
time for breaking ono's fast, and certainly too early
for people to got ready if they want to travol by rail
in tho morning. Then, tho next train goes at a qua'r
tor-past 1 o'clock, whon pcoplo aro at dinner, and
thcro is no other train till half-past 4. The incoming
trains aro evidently arranged so as to accommodate
people who may wish to como to tho Sydnoy churches,
for tho first leaves Parramatta at half-past 9, and
arrives in Sydnoy at about kalf-past 10. Tho train
leaving Sydnoy at a quarter-past 1 seems to have boen
put on to tako theso passengers back again. Tho fow
other trains seem to havo been arranged on a simi
lar principle, and without the slighest . consideration
either for Sydney pcoplo who may wish to embrace,
perhaps, the only opportunity they have during the
week for visiting their friends in the suburbs, or for
Sydney people who may -wish to go to some of the
suburban places of worship. Tho whole arrange
ment is absurd, and bears evidonco of selfish clerical
influenco at work behind the scenes.

'Good evening, mate, I hope I don't alarm you in
the least;
I'm on my way to Devil's Gully to find a man
called Priest.
I've just come up from Murphy's Luck, the old
man's near pegged out;
Perhaps you know the man I want—he lives up
hereabout.
' I've ridden hard for sixty miles, my horse is
getting stiff;
Since four o'clook this morning I have not had a
whiff.
So if you don't object I'll hobble Tempest for the
night;
There's lots of feed around your camp—he won't
go out of sight.'
' I know your man,' the digger said; ' but come,
let's have some tea,
Or if you prefer a drop of rum, why, here, yon
see,
I always keep a little by to welcome chaps like.
you.
So here's a Merry Christmas now, and many of
them too.'
'The same to you, my friend. Ah, yes, 'tis
Christmas once again I
To most men it brings happiness—to me 'tis
always pain.
Some twenty yean ago I lost my dearest friend
and best;
To think that we may meet again seems almost
like a jest.
1 Now, just to make the time go by—that is, if
you've a mind—
I'll tell you of that Christmas, and how Murphy
made a find.
You'll keep the story secret, mate ?—old Murphy
won't last long;
I would not wish for all the world to do him any
wrong.
' The three of us were shipmates, and we all got
into work
On Ballyohannon cattle run, then owned by
Paddy Burke—
Ton must remember sixty-six, the Oympie just
broke out—
Poor Tom and I were stockmen there, and
Murphy routeabout;
1 From near and far the ush was great, for times
were very bad. * '
Of course we started out as well—but would we
never had,
For though we tackled to the work and stood it
well a while,
We found that those who did the least made up
the biggest pile.
1 Thus things went on till Christmas came and
brought its usual cheer;
The publicans got all our cash, and we got too
mnch beer.
New Year's Day fairly cleaned us oat, and left us
on the rocks,
Except that Tom expeoted soon an English
Christmas box.
' The letter came, and Tom went down to town
to get the cash.
Now, mate, I hope you will not think that I am
over rash,
But Murphy also disappeared. I'm sure you'll
think it strange
Tom ne'er again returned to tell us how he crossed
the range.
' Some twenty days or more went by, I'd just
dozed off to sleep,
And such a horrid dream I had, it makes my flesh
still creep;
I saw Tom Humphrey on his horse jost crossing
o'er a creek,
And close behind him rose a man—oh, mate, I
scarce can speak.
'Just pour me out a drop of rum! The man was
masked and tall;
He had a hunting crop; it's end was loaded with
a ball;
He raised it high, poor Tom fell down, he dragged
him to the bush;
'Twas all but dark; I wakened then. Some one
gave me a push.
' I looked around; there Murphy stood all trem
bling. "" Mat,"" said he,
"" I've made a find, and mean that you shall share
the lot with me.""
I seized my gun and looked about to find my
powder flask,
He looked so like Tom's murderer; the man who
wore the mask.
'He told me he had been prospecting up the
Forest Creek,
And came acroßß Tom Humphrey lying wonnded,
pale, and weak.
He knew he had not long to live, and whispered—
Murphy said—
"" I leave my all to Mat and you; think of me when
I'm dead.""
' I looked Mick Murphy in the face, and levelling
my gun,
"" You are his murderer,"" I said. "" There's one
chance for you—run.""
He turned and find, a guilty man, and soon was
out of sight;
And from that day to this we've never met until
. last night.
1 Now he is dying. "" Mat,"" said he, "" I want you
here alone.
I'm glad that you've turned up at last before ray
life is done.
There's something lying on my soul which you
alone must know.
You guessed aright. I robbed poor Tom, but
murder him—oh, no!
' I left him bleeding by the creek. I dared not
go to look
If still he lived; but there—see Mat—you'll find
his pocket-book.
I banked the money in his name, and, oh, I wish
to heaven
That Tom was here a living man, to Bay ' You are
forgiven.'
""'Once in a dream I saw him, by his camp fire
burning clear—
It seemed to be in Devil's Gully, sixty miles from
here.
Hiß name was changed; they called him Priest.
Oh, bring him while I live,
If lift could only know my pain, I'm Bure he would
forgive.""'
The digger rose, and looked about, and said,
'Jußt wait awhile;
I've got to see a friend of mine o'er yonder—half
a mile.'
He caught his horse and saddled him, and rode
until the dawn,
Nor halted till at last he stopped in front of
Murphy's lawn.
He walked into his old mate's room, and knelt
down at his feet.
The dying penitent awoke from slumber calm and
sweet,
And smiled to see Tom kneeling there, and wept
to hear him pray,
' God make his passage easy, and take all his sins
away 1'
That night, ere sunset, Mat returned, to find his
digger friend
Was Tom himself, arrived in time to sooth old
Murphy's end.
And sure enough the pocket-book was there, all
safe and sound,
With interest added twenty years. Tom's Christ
mas-box was found.",The Queenslander ,"895,870,869,819,883,175,897,237,904,423,904,189,904,222,903,98,904,110,906,280,903,357,904,66,906,74,904,181,907,833,906,222,905,171,906,189,905,293,905,223,907,284,907,117,907,170,909,284,910,212,907,373,923,843,907,186,902,224,907,284,915,436,904,197,907,230,905,267,904,277,903,177,906,282,906,180,914,321,905,194,904,217,903,308,902,302,906,116,906,302,904,291,884,424,906,304,902,235,905,270,903,244,904,278,907,268,903,189,907,144,907,398,907,226,907,260,906,201,908,204,905,315,907,384,907,178,906,290,905,173,906,167,901,285,899,85,904,480,904,172,903,326,906,132,897,276,901,285,899,298,901,109,901,314,901,123,901,234,899,258,897,283,880,350",Sat 17 Dec 1892,"383,465,529,1202,622,663,696,740,781,817,852,899,954,997,1033,1077,1110,1156,1189,1233,1290,1332,1370,1420,1447,1499,1526,1567,1627,1666,1706,1746,1784,1827,1863,1904,1964,2005,2041,2083,2121,2154,2200,2250,2301,2340,2378,2419,2458,2498,2537,2576,2636,2674,2715,2754,2792,2833,2871,2912,2973,3011,3052,3090,3129,3170,3208,3247,3309,3348,3387,3427,3466,3506,3545,3584,3644,3683,3721,3762,3800,3841,3879,3920,3992,4030,4069,4109,4146,4187,4224,4268,4335,4375,4414,4455,4493,4534,4572,4611,4671,4712,4751,4789,4828,4868,4907,4945,5006,5055,5085,5123,5162,5203,5241,5280,5339,5378,5417,5455,5494,5534,5573,5611,5682,5723,5761,5800,5838,5879,5917,5956,6025,6065,6102,6143,6180,6219,6258,6298,6433,6474,6512,6551,370,411,444,490,543,589,622,674,701,746,778,825,882,926,961,1005,1038,1082,1118,1161","268,283,283,1271,282,342,268,342,263,342,263,339,263,339,263,339,263,337,261,339,261,339,258,339,260,334,260,334,257,334,257,334,257,332,255,331,255,331,254,329,252,331,252,328,252,328,250,326,249,326,249,326,233,324,246,323,247,324,246,324,233,323,247,323,246,323,244,323,246,323,246,321,244,321,244,321,236,320,241,320,241,320,243,320,243,320,239,317,238,317,239,315,239,318,236,323,238,315,236,315,238,315,235,312,235,313,236,313,233,313,233,307,233,312,233,233,235,312,233,309,233,309,233,310,233,307,233,304,233,312,233,309,233,307,233,309,233,309,233,309,233,307,233,309,1239,1310,1235,1309,1235,1310,1235,1310,1235,1309,1235,1307,1235,1307,1235,1309,1235,1309,1235,1306",19829849,Page 2

By Lydia M. D. O'Neil
I Stand beside the Border Gate, that guards the border trails;
One highway into Queensland leads, and one to New South Wales;
And far across the lonely Range the rolling ribbons run;
One goes down to Sydney-town, one north to find the sun:
And I must choose which I shall take — I must not here remain,
And when I pass the Border Gate, I cannot turn again.
How many miles to Sydney-town, how many miles to Ayr ?—
How many miles to Happiness what distance to Despair ? —
I have no roof-tree o'er my head, I have no hearth, nor sill;
My feet are free to take the road and wander where they will.
Which is the way to Heart's Desire, and which the path to Pain ? —
For when I've passed the Border Gate I cannot turn again.
How can I tell which trail to take, or what my feet may find ?
I cannot know what lies before, but only what's behind.
I can but spin a copper coin, as vagrants all have spun —
Then south-away to Sydney-town, or north to seek the sun.
And that the coin spin wise and well, may kindly fates ordain,
For once I've passed the Border Gate, I cannot turn again.",The Courier-Mail ,"706,524,968,1012,900,959,1024,885,1011,947,981,962,1063,942,1038,901,906,959,984,943,1023",Sat 8 Aug 1936,"6366,6472,6543,6584,6620,6656,6690,6726,6787,6822,6859,6895,6926,6965,7026,7061,7096,7133,7167,7204,7259","3300,3390,3110,3161,3121,3120,3119,3117,3120,3119,3083,3123,3121,3121,3120,3122,3100,3123,3123,3122,3078",38497131,Page 14

A Scrub Farm Morning.
'Tis quiet in the morning ere the sunbeams kiss the
dew,
When the valley's misty blankets hide the lower lands
from view,
And the smoke from clearing fires, made night
before,
Lies half way up the ridges like headland! from the
shore,
And Just beyond the fires, as tho' in slumber deep,
And loth to heat the valleys and wake them from
their sleep,
Is seen the late corn cobbing, the logs and stumpi
repose
Beneath the feathery flow'rlng, and pumpkins 'tween
the rows.
Nought breaks the ttllly sllonoo save a wallaby or
two,
Who hurries home, his maize meal well covered up
from view;
He takes hia leave desulter, and has no time to sp«ro;
He knows first streak of daylight will bring the farmer
there,
His muzzle-loading musket choked to the mouth to
kill-
Three draohms and more of powder, and alugs a half
Sint'a fill. .
wary tread and stealthy the farmer gains the
corn,
Boon hid beneath the Ink Plant he waits the coming
dawn;
With daylight's early morning he knows far up the
rango
The cockatoos have started to give his corn at onange.
Whon daylight's early glanoes gold tip the range's
crest
Too soon to woke the clearing and misty valley's
rest—
'Tis then the straying sunbeams in chasing out the
ni ht ,
In joy reflect and sparkle on apeok* of moving white.
The eastern sky is chauging, aud ruby-tinted gold
Spreads o'er tho sleeping valleys and bids the nrsts
unfold;
The fires' smoky headlands move, change from white
to blur>,
And lazy rising upward are lost to nether view.
The crystal dewß are smiling, coquetting with the sun,
80 geutly sweet ere rising, so heart:esi ero he's cone.
The m Ike re' bells are ringing, the Jackass hails tho
morn;
Those spooks of white, much larger, aro circling o'er
tho corn,
80 wary, ever watchful, in silence circling round;
Then from a sun-blcacbed tree top they search the
lower ground.
AU's well 1 In silence dropping they spread upon the
corn,
With two above left watching and at alarm to warn.
The morning sun ia showing bis rim upon the east,
Reflecting on whlto foaihers free in their milky feast.
The farmer still ia waiting—a dozen iv a row,
He'll puil Brown Bess's triggers (both tall) and let her
60.
The birds are feeding nearer; at last ten :n a line,
And resolute on rouidet- he fires the double mine.
Hugo deafening explosion! It drowns the screech of
' pain,l
And thund'ringto the mountain is cchood back again.
Grim satisfaction bonming from his half-hidden face
Ho count* the dozen bodies, curses the feathered race.
The early sun has risen, tho dew hides 'neath the
grass,
The farmer pokes his fires and notes the smoke
wreaths pass;

recollections of mv childhood home, in
a lonely spot on a tributary of the Hun
ter River, N.S.W. :
Dear home of my youth, I remember it
well,
And the flowers that blossomed o'er
highland and dell!
And it's green hills and cliffs I can
vision today
White flocks of our sheep, ^and the wild
goats at playl
0 crystal-clear stream, oft we bathed
in thy tide,
By springs from the mountain-slopes
? freely supplied,
Or swam near the spray -of a waterfall
clear,
Tree-bordered, descending o'er rock-faces
sheer.
A pastor sought sometimes our house
in the wild,
Whose words. found their mark in the
heart of each child.
Our joys and our sorrows he well under
stood; . '
And his presence alone made us long to
be good. *
There's a spot by the creek-side, that,
more than the rest,
Awakens fair memories, deep in my
breast;
On' three sides there sparkled the
water's pure sheen ;
And purple-trimmed shrubs decked its
carpet of green.
Here tiny birds sang; and there hovered
the bee,
Where parrot-hues lit a great currajong
tree; _^_",The Central Queensland Herald ,"716,394,677,712,714,715,713,715,340,715,76,712,329,715,220,714,255,713,226,715,290,715,90,716,94,715,210,714,364,705,657,719,542,719,361,720,120,719,360,718,290,716,144,715,580",Thu 6 Aug 1936,"5014,5055,5108,5148,5188,5227,5267,5306,5347,5414,5456,5494,5534,5573,5614,5652,5693,5762,5803,5841,5882,5921,5962,6000,6040,6109,6149,6187,6227,6267,6296,3634,3670,3743,3783,3823,3863,3902,3942,3981,4023,4093,4134,4170,4215","2438,2597,2475,2439,2438,2437,2438,2435,2438,2435,2514,2437,2510,2435,2508,2434,2508,2433,2509,2432,2495,2431,2508,2431,2507,2431,2505,2431,2505,2429,2507,3200,3276,3201,3274,3199,3273,3199,3274,3199,3273,3199,3272,3199,3273",70626588,Page 12

BLIGHTED HOPES !
THE friends of King Arthur were quaffing strong
wine,
For they flattor'd themselves that they'd taken
the shine
Out of old Doctor Lang and the Brisbaneites
true,
Who scouted Bill Wentworth's ""Political Stew.""
The Priest and the Parson they had on their side,
And the lovers of freedom they hop'd to divide ;
And bigotry, flattery, money, and fear
Were draw upon - also wine, brandy, and beer.
The cause of the Doctor look'd gloomy indeed,
For tlio joints of the tail of King Arthur, with
speed
To rejoin him, were rushing o'er mountain and
swamp,
All eager to get the place next to the - stump.
The lord of the Swallow had got up his steam,
And grunting rode ouward like one in a dream ;
But with his strong boiler no pressure could cope,
When back'd by the boilers of tallow and soap.
The Earl of Mount Brisbane rode forward in
wrath,
With Bamey O'Keefe and bright Darby McGrath ;
And the Town Marie lawgiver keenly enjoy'd
The eloquent lore of that little love Lloyd ;
While behind him, in station befitting his fame,
The Frenchman who made him a lawgiver carme ¡
And honest Bob Little kept just within view,
With young Tommy Jones and old Pollet Cardew.
All Drayton was shouting and yelling with joy ;
And ""the people"" (five half tipsy men and a
boy,)
Embrac'd, and half smother'd in slaver and
beer,
King Arthur's twelve Knights of the washpool
and shear.
- The battle was over -the polling was past -
And equal the voting for each at the last ;
So ""King Arthur the victor"" they toasted with
pride,
For they knew that the Major was safe on their
side.
Hark ! Hush ! There's a horseman comes gallop-
ing in,
With his sorrowful mouth nearly down to his
chin :
One glance at his visage half opens their eyes,
For they know him as one of their confidant
spies.
""Oh dash down the wine cup !- Be pallid each
nose.
Why paint them so redly to honour your foes?
The Major will vote for King Arthur, 'tis true ;
But his vote isn't worth a brass button to you.""
"" Oh why did you press Dicky Watson to poll,
When you knew that his name had no right on
the roll ?
His vote goes for nothing - myself I could hang
To think that they've got in that Radical Lang !
He has a majority, certain, of one ;
So, in spite of the Major, King Arthur is done :
And still, lest the Doctor's success you won't own,
There's a small rod in pickle for Mister
M'Kono.""",The Moreton Bay Courier ,"525,359,749,75,746,137,744,71,729,746,744,589,726,709,745,83,744,111,710,709,742,746,718,746,94,743,691,665,724,744,689,740,733,746,76,745,76,749,154,675,643,744,85,743,66,746,99,748,122,713,749,80,745,71,700,719,718,706,746,131,736,748,547,736,746,749,148",Sat 3 Jun 1854,"3533,3605,3650,3688,3721,3758,3794,3833,3866,3901,3936,3972,4008,4073,4108,4145,4180,4226,4251,4281,4322,4358,4393,4456,4494,4529,4562,4598,4636,4671,4708,4742,4809,4842,4883,4917,4952,4990,5025,5062,5097,5133,5170,5205,5241,5296,5331,5366,5402,5438,5474,5510,5545,5591,5617,5646,5689,5755,5791,5827,5862,5897,5934,5970,6005,6037,6079","4179,4254,4066,4212,4066,4212,4066,4210,4067,4064,4066,4064,4065,4064,4063,4206,4063,4205,4061,4061,4063,4060,4060,4058,4204,4060,4057,4056,4058,4056,4056,4058,4054,4053,4196,4053,4189,4049,4195,4047,4050,4049,4192,4047,4190,4047,4191,4045,4189,4045,4043,4188,4045,4189,4046,4042,4043,4044,4041,4185,4040,4038,4039,4037,4037,4037,4181",3716310,Page 2

A longing for seclusion;

A name that hurt the oyster.
""I see,"" she cried, ""you're open 'Wide,
And, searching for a reason, 1
September's here, and so it's clear
That oysters are in season.""
She smiled a smile that showed this style '
Of badinage rejoiced her, '
And advanced a pace with easy grace
And sniffed the silent oyster! '
The latter's pride was sorely tried,
He thought of what he could say,
Reflected what the common lot
Of vulgar mollusks would say;
He caught his breath, turned pale as death;
?His brow grew slightly moister;
\Began to close, and nipped her nose! - .-- '

To sum it up briefly I drank it.
Ifr was Christmas time, and of course a crowd !
Where in fair and foul weather we'd travelled
together,
And bteo fast chums, d'ye see.
When a man is half inclined to the wrong,
Excuses are easy to seek ;
I know there's a dovil that makes you strong,
When you really were never so weak.
I stayed that day, and the next, and the next,
Just to humour ttio wish of a friend ;
And though at times I was sorely vexed,
'To the day tnfficient the evil,' my text ;
To the devil all care I would send.
And I mocked the pang of the serpent's fang,
That serpent of whom the Israelite sang,
Whose bite is felt at the end.
One night I awoke in delirium's throes,
The dead-house my lodging then ;
Where round me lay moaning and shrieking
and groaning, _ ?
And smiting the walls of their den,
Cursing and ravisjl with biting thirst craving :
For this ! for thu ! they'd been toiling and

And plunged in the Stygian blackness of

Euroka go over the tops of the hill,
For the death-clouds have passed us to-day,
And we'll cry in the dark for the footfalls still,
And the tracks which are fading away !
Let them yell to their lubras, the Bulginbah dogs,
And say how our brothers were slain ;
We shall wipe out our grief in the blood of their chief,
And twenty more dead on the plain---
On the blood sputtered spurs of the plain !
But the low winds sigh,
And the dead leaves fly,
Where our warriors lie,
In the dingo's den-in the white-cedar glen
On the banks of the gloomy Urara !
Urara ! Urara !
On the banks of the gloomy Urara !
The Wallaroos grope through the tufts of the grass,
And crawl to their coverts for fear,
But we'll sit in the ashes ard let them pass
""Where the boomerangs sleep with the spear !
Oh ! our hearts will be lonely and low to-night,
When we think of the hunts of yore ;
And thee foes that we sought, and the fights which we fought,
With those who will battle no more---
""Who will go to the battle no more !
For the dull winds sigh,
And the dead leaves fly,
Where our warriors lie,
In the dingo's den---in the white-cedar glen
On the banks of the gloomy Urara !
Urara ! Urara !
On the banks of the gloomy Urara !
Oh ! the gorges and gullies arc black with crows,
And they feast on the flesh of the brave,
But the forest is loud with the howls of our foes
For those whom they never can save !
Let us crouch with our faces down to our knees,
And hide in the dark of our hair ;
For we will not return where the camp-fires burn,
And see what is smouldering there---
What is smouldering, mouldering there !
Where the sad winds sigh---
The dead leaves fly,
And our warriors lie,
In the dingo s den---in the white-cedar Glen
On the banks of the gloomy Urara !

The golden spears
Of the ripening ears
Peep from tho crested and penoned matzo.

Just as tho almanac foretold.
In early Summer tho brigand crow
Made ruthless raids
On the sprouting blades ;
Tho weeds fought long with tho farmer's hoo :
And tho wallabies and 'possums liavo had their share
Of nil but tho good man's toil and care ;

Has filled her house,
And the birds are flocking from no one knows where.

And pack them tight
In pyramids shapely and statoly and round.

At the conclusion of the Anthem, the Hon. A. H.
Palmer stepped forward, and on behalf of the Council
of the Association, requested His Excellency the
Governor to open the Exhibition.
His Excellency the Governor then addressing the
assemblage said,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN :-I have seen it stated in
the newspapers that I am to deliver an address, and
I desire to defend myself from aspersions hy
notifying at the very outset that my words shall
be few indeed. It is the more easy for me
to do so, that I have not come muoh about the Exhibi-
tion buildings of late to worry the Commissioners and
interrupt the workmen, so . that many things that I
hope to seo to-day will bo as great novelties, and as
much a surprise to myself as to anyone here present ;
still I think I know enough to be able to congratulate
you upon the variety and qualities of the exhibits
as being wholly unprecedented in both respects in
Queensland. This result has been brought about
not only by our own exertions, but notably through
the good offices of the Bister colonies, Now South
Wales, as the oldest of the group, taking-and deserv-
ing to take-a foremost place. Let me not forget
to mention that Sydney has rendered us an im
, portant service, and given us encouragement in another
1 way. The Central Association is represented in Brisbane
by its experienced and indefatigable secretary, Monsieur
Jules Joubort, who in his kind and genial manner, and
while insisting we had materially helped his society in
the past, when it wanted help, and that one good turn
has been felt to deserve another, has shown UB certain
Bpeoial advantages wo possess for holding such exhi-
bitions, and how we may best apply them. Now,
in conversation tho other . day with Mon-
sieur Joubort, I put it to him that the
objects of a national or central association might
, not be, audi was inclined to believe were not, sufficiently
I appreciated or understood, and that a disposition might
I exist in some quarters to regard it aB a meauB of de
! traoting from tho importance of local exhibitions, so
as to bring all the benefit or "" kudoB"" to tho capital.
Monsiour Joubert'B rejoinder was that in the neigbour
ing territory a similar objection had been taken
at the outset, but that such places as, for
instance, Singleton, soon came to see how useful it
waB to them to have a recognised centre of competition
where a staudard of superior .fitness or quality should
periodically bo raised in the sight of all the country
This observation, of courso, applies to agricultural auc
pastoral exhibits only, for iu respect of wha
I may call town industries, und of tho depart
ment of the fine arts, there can nowhere
be any contention as to the locality in which
such productions ought to be brought together for
submission to a final test You scarcely need to be
reminded of the difficulty ef selecting for the purposes
of a general exhibition such a time of year as should
do equal justice to all the interests claiming to be
represented within the limits of Bowen Park. Thus the
season that may suit the exhibitor of stock may not suit
the agriculturist and gardener ; and again, should the
shearing season have arrived the appearance put in on
behalf of ono of our most prominent staples must neces-
sarily he incomplete. Add to such drawbacks the long
distances to be travelled, and the as yet imperfect
means of rapid transport, and I think you will agree
that all things considered, we, Queenslanders, may
felicitate ourselves upon what has been achieved as a
first attempt, and may hopefully look forward to still
more satisfactory results being obtained when once we
have felt our way. Ia conclusion, may I ask the question
what more substantial advantage the statesman or the
Eatriot could desire than that by such means as are
ere afforded each of the competing colonies should be
brought to see wherein its strength lay, for is it not the
I case that when this was seen, a healthy and altogether
! friendly rivalry would follow; nay, a general union
would be speedily established upon foundations that
should endure long after Border duties and other Cus-
toms exactions were things of the forgotten past.
His Excellency then formally declared the Exhibition
to be opened, and read a congratulatory message from
New South Wales.
The general public were then admitted, and the mem-
bers of the Musical Union Bang the opening hymn, by
Mr. J. Brunton Stephens.
While nations joining gifts
Their fanes of Art adorn,
Hear, Lord, the lowly voice that lifts
The song of the youngest-born.
The gifts of the youngest-born.
We snread them forth to Thee,
What toll hath wrought, what skill hath taught,
What Freedom hath brought the free.
No storied name we vaunt,
Nor martial trophies raise ; '
No battle-riven banners flaunt
The triumphs of other days.
But triumphs of peaceful days
Adorn our jubilee ;
Hero toll and skill Thine ends fulfil.
With hands that from blood are free.
We pile the arms of Poace,
Her trophies manifold,
Her ploughshare swords, her shields of fleece,
Uer armour of bloodless gold.
Our treasuros of fleece and gold
We consecrate to Thee,
With choicest yield of fruitful field.
And spoil from the forest-tree.
We bless Thee for bur land,
Broad streams and gladdening rills,
For flocks that roam on ev'ry hand,
For herds on a thousand hills.
From all its thousand hills
Our land doth call to Thee,
Still do Thou bless with happiness
This youngest of the free.
It is calculated that moro than fifteen thousand per-
sons (iuoluding thoso who had the privilege of entree
before the opening) were admitted through the arch in
tho centre of the gateway in Gregory Terrace, and

BY JAMES II.,
KING OF SCOTLAND.
(FROM THE TRANSMITTER.)
The banquet o'er, the Scottish monarch drew
The Douglas forth into a distant room,
Which overlooked the ga den down below
Then quoth the King, "" Good Earl, wilt thou
renounce
The dark designs thou'st .nourished 'gainst our
life, ;
And let fond friendship re unite our hands,
And mem'ries of .the past forever fade?
Think of thy sires, who, with the gallant Bruce,
Fought side by side through many bloody
strifes;
Remember him, the feared by Southron foe,
Who, far away on arid Easte. n plains
Obtained thy badge-the mighty crimson heart
An emblem of his truth and loyalty.
Then thou, a member of this noble race
Thou, whom we'd love to cherish as a friend,
A friend whom nought but death alone could
part,
Thus turn your back on Scotland and her King,
And, by thy harsh and heartless conduct, give
An entrance to a foreign enemy/*
"" Not so,"" replied the fierce and angry earl,
""The blame lies with thyself, and thou shalt
gain
The guerdon of.thine own unworthy deeds.
Thy hand has wrought the evil to this land,
And on thee let ;the"" consequences fallí""
A shadow o'er the sovereign's features passed ;
The veins stood but like cords upon his brow;
The words that would his angry thoughts ex-
press,
Broke inarticulate within his throat.
He bit his lip'and turned his face away
To see if guards or menials were about.
Not one was there save grim'Sir Patrick Gray,
Who, motionless like some gaunt statue,' stood,
His armor gleaming in the ruddy light
Cast through the window by tho settin ; sun.
His hands were resting on the lengthy shaft
Of his old friend, a sturdy battle-axe.
When James thus viewed that knight so close at
hand
(Whom well he knew was yearning"" for revenge .
Upon his deadly foe, the Douglas Earl)
He drew a sparkling poniard from his belt,
And ere the Earl could guess his foul intent,
He dealt on him a swift and deadly blow.
Sir Patrick, startled by the sudden noise,
Rushed forward with his weapon poised aloft,
And on the prostrate body of the Earl
He ended what his master had begun.

communication received yesterday will prove
that it has been adopted with signal success in
the direction of Tahiti s-]
' Dear Sister,-I am sad to hear
'' That your affairs are rather queer.
1 I'm told a certain brawling chief
Has"" caused Your Majesty much grief;
"" It being his malicious aim
i To set your nation in a flame.
» - Yet, notwithstanding this was known,
' The people who surround your throne,
4 .While through the land his treasons rung,
i i Did not know how to stop his tongue.
' And many-many months went by
Ere they could, as they call it, try ;
"" ' And others even followed them
> '' Before they managed to condemn.
- i And after that, as I am told,
When you had of that varlet hold,
t i While all your Judges gravely chid,
I s He only laughed at what they did.
v At ease his mirthful hours were spent ;
Your people taxed to pay his rent ;
And, while he feathered well his nest,
V ~ Your laws and you were made his jest.
Still you, my Sister, were content
With this burlesque on punishment ;
But he, I hear, preferred a writ,
. That is, said he would not submit ;
At least without, these were his words,
""A battle with the House of Lords.""
And, next, I find their lordships saw
..It-right to ask about the law,....
And seven judges vowed that he
WHS not entitled to be free ;
' While two said they could not speak poz,
But thought upon the whole be was.
The matter being thus perplext,
, It to the House of Lords came next ;
L There all the peer« were push'd aside.
For five old lawyers to decide}
When three declared for him, and two
Voted, as is called, for you.
AU this is right, the English throng
May say, but I pronounce it wrong ;
Ridiculous it seems to me
Yow rule should be ""the Rule of Three.""
Since it is thus-since three grim Whigs
Can thus oontrire to run their rigs,
Your Majesty, by such odd tricks,
Must feel that you are in a fix,
If three, who ure disposed to rail
At justice, can so far prevail
That they may laugh to scorn all others,
And mack a score of learned brothers,
' Tis plain that law in your poor land
Only a few can understand.
^ With law, too, reason must decay,
If not already passed away.
Since we see, in this iron time,
Impunity extend to crime,
Of course, your gentle heart must chafe.
And feel you're not exactly safe.
Be off while you can choose and pick ;
Your Majesty must cut your stick.
If you make up your mind to roam,
Tahiti offers you a home.
Here no such trash can e'er obtain
As that which sends you o'er the main ;
Since your war fleet no more defends
From those who prove they are not friends.
A squadron of my grand Canoes
I'll order to confound your ibes ;
Arid, better (ban ii doubtful throne,
A royal hut shall be your own.
; Come, then, Oh Queen-lose little time
In passing to a happier clime,
Where men, though called uncivilized,
Are still afraid to be despised
For spurning, on some mean pretence,
AH that appears like common sense,
And then affect, with sacred awe,
' To laud the dignity of law.

Nottno the demise of the Oreenock Adver
tiser, a paper started in 1802, the Christian
Leader tays the most notable incident in its
history, next to the fact that it died twice, was
its rejection of one of the finest poems of
Campbell, sent by the youthful author of "" The
Pleasures of Hope "" for insertion in the poets'
corner. The editor put in a notice to the poet
that his attempt was not ""up to the mark' 1 of
the Advertiser.
It is interesting, from the philological point
of view, to learn from the Indian native papers
that native visitors to England are accused by
their countrymen of helping to degrade the
Oriental languages on their return. It is
alleged to be "" their general habit to speak the
English language ana to anglicise the verna

FOR
THE QUEEN'S BIRTH-DAY, 1814.
BY MR. M. ROBINSON.
IN Early GREECE, when War no more,
With Aspect wild, deform'd her Shore;
Nor longer on the tented Plain
Swell'd the shrill Clangor's martial Strain,
Proud to retrace their native Soil,
Her Swains retir'd to rural Toil ;
To Scenes which oft in fond Review
Fancy's sweet Illusions drew ;
Add there the crippled Warrior told
Of Battles won by Prowess bold;
Of hair-breadth 'Scapes on hostile Ground,
Of Comrades scarr'd with many a Wound ;
Then Industry, with busy Hand,
Rester'd the long neglected Land,
And Shepherds sung, while Peasants toil'd,
Till Vales with waving Plenty smil'd :—
For hush'd was howling Discord's baleful Train,
The Olive bloom'd, and Peace proclaim'd her Reign !
And then the graceful Muses found
Their sacred Haunts on classic Ground ;
What Time their HOMER'S magic Page,
Enlightning, charm'd a wond'ring Age,
Form'd the bold Theme, and, with aspiring Strain,
Sung ILIUM'S Fall — and mourn'd her Heroes slain.
Then ATHENS saw her rising Day
Illum'd by Wisdoms's spreading Ray,
And Arts, and Science, hand in hand,
Advance progressive o'er the Land.
The Painter's Skill, the Sculptor's Toil,
Bade Genius venerate the Soil :—
Hence splendid Structures rose on high,
Whose polish'd Columns reach'd the Sky;
And ample Domes, and hallow'd Fames,
Where Piety inspir'd seraphic Strains:—
Temples, where Truth shone forth with radiant Rays,
And swelling Choirs prolong'd the Notes of Praise.
But tho' rude Time, that with relentless Sway
Bids ""cloud-cap't Tow'rs"" and stately Domes
decay,
Has levell'd all those Monuments of Taste,
And Ruins, only, mark the wilder'd Waste;
Still shall fair Wisdom's Page uninjur'd stand,
Still brave the Wreck of Time's impairing Hand ;
And ancient GREECE one Meed of Glory claim,
To raise her Annals high in story'd Fame ;
Whilst faithful Mem'ry pauses to review
The brightest Æra polish'd ATHENS knew!
When her enlighten'd Seers of old,
Skill'd in prophetic Lore, foretold
That o'er the Western Main an Isle
Should flourish under FREEDOM's Smile ;
Whose mighty KINGS, thro' Times unborn,
The regal Sceptre should adorn ;
Whose CONSORTS, form'd with Virtues rare,
Should prosper — HEAV'N's peculiar Care ;
Whose august Race, by kindred Worth ally'd,
Should rise the Hope, and prove the Nation's
Pride.
THAT ISLE has flourish'd, eminent in Fame,
Supreme in Arms, and ALBION IS HER NAME !
ALBION ! on whose distinguish'd Heroes brave,
Illustrious Wreaths of blooming Laurels wave :
Such as left NELSON's Name renown'd in Story,
And now embellish WELLINGTON's with Glory!
Hence has the Muse, with vent'rous Lay,
Aspir'd to sing this halcyon Day,
And bade her humble Lyre proclaim
Thro' distant Climes, OUR CHARLOTTE's
NAME.
From chilling Zembla's snow-cap't Lands,
To sultry Afric's burning Sands ;
From Pole to Pole the Trump of Fame
Swells the proud Note to CHARLOTTE's
NAME !
ILLUSTRIOUS QUEEN ! exalted WIFE!
Ador'd thro' ev'ry Stage of Life ;
By Nature's Impulse taught to share
THY CONSORT's ling'ring Hours of Care.
And when consuming Sickness spread
Pale Terrors o'er His drooping Head ;
When trembling Hope could scarcely dare
To snatch one Respite from Despair,
'Twas THINE to charm with Sympathy's sweet
Pow'r,
Trace the faint Gleam, and watch the doubtful
Hour,
'Twas THINE with fond Solicitude to prove
Duty was Friendship — and that Friendship, Love.
FROM THY EXAMPLE SHALL THE WORLD
RECEIVE
A RICHER BOON than DIADEMS COULD GIVE !
NEW SOUTH WALES, }
Jan. 18, 1814. }
This day a cart was stopped on the Parramatta
Road, and robbed of a chest of tea ; and a few
days ago Mr. S. Larkin was stopped on the same
road, on horseback, by three footpads, who robbed
him of £6 sterling.
From our Correspondent at Hobart Town we are
happy to learn that the wheat harvest, which com-
menced at Pitt-water the 26th ult. and shortly after
became general, bore a very fine and promising ap-
pearance; an article of information that will be the
more generally acceptable to us as our own crops
have been severely injured by droughts, the long
prevalency of which we scarcely recollect a previous
instance of. The first who began reaping was a
young settler of the name of Reardon, formerly of
Norfolk Island. The crop of barley had been un-
commonly productive, and potatoes, and vegetables
in general, afforded an abundant prospect. The
improved and progressively improving condition of
the various species of stock, was highly grati-
fying.
We have much to regret the loss on the passage
of twenty out of 20 horses and mares shipped
from hence in the Eliza, Captain Murray, for Ho-
bart Town.
The Lady Nelson, from Norfolk Island, with
salted pork and mutton, had arrived, and was in
Frederick Henry Bay when the Elizabeth came
away.
The following articles of information, are copied
from the latest London Papers received :—
Among the most remarkable articles in the late
American papers, is one stating, that on the 27th
of March the Success, of and from Boston to Ca-
diz, was captured by the French frigate Arethuse,
and sunk; the French Captain at the same time ex-
pressing his regret at having fallen in with her, as
he said his orders were positive, to destroy all Ame-
rican vessels on such a destination. So much for
""the liberty of the seas,"" and His Imperial Majes-
""ty's love for the Americans !""
Mr. Justice Grose is said to have at length retired
from the Court of King's Bench; and is to be suc-
ceeded, according to report by Mr. Dampier.
In June last, J. Wiltshire and C. Conolly were
committed to Exeter, from thence to be conveyed
to London, to be tried at the next Admiralty Ses-
sions, for aiding and abetting His Majesty's enemies
on the high seas.—These men were taken in a vessel
that had been captured and manned by the True
Blooded Yankee, privateer.
The following most extraordinary circumstance is
mentioned in a letter from Edinburgh :— A gentle-
man of respectability, in the medical profession,
cut his throat on the 12th of June, in that city —
Immediately before he committed suicide, it is said
he wrote a paper, in which he acknowledged that
he was the person who robbed and murdered Beg-
bie, the porter, some years ago. It is remarkable,
that when the body of Begbie was examined after
the murder, the surgeons expressed an opinion,
from the nature of the wound, that the assassin was
a person of anatomical knowledge.
The Cornwall paper of Saturday says, that the
Prussian ship Wilhelm Gustaff, which arrived at
Falmouth on Monday (June 20), from Bourdeaux,
brought over passenger Madame Moreau, the wife
of the French General. This lady had returned to
France, from America, for the benefit of her health,

In Memoriam
ROBERT BROWNING.
ALICE HAM.
The world's great teacher laid aside his pen,
Bowed his white head, and passed beyond our ken
To the eternal verities; and yet no death
Can rob us of him, since the throbbing breath
Of life immortal pulsates through his words,
That noble music set in deepest chords.
The why and wherefore of this life of ours
He read, while other poets pressed its flowers.
Beyond the problems of all time and place,
Steadfast, he saw the shining of a Face.
His work being done, he passed with trust replete
From "" Man's Nothing-perfect to God's All-complete.""
And yet- What is this cloud, that spreads so wide?
A sense of something lost since Browning died!",The Queenslander ,"849,485,679,384,588,187,737,834,689,767,773,663,704,924,757,661,829,924,887,795",Sat 8 Feb 1890,"483,652,767,847,898,1509,995,1030,1063,1098,1139,1164,1197,1230,1265,1296,1331,1364,1416,1463","501,688,592,742,638,1153,482,480,479,479,443,479,479,443,443,480,479,443,479,476",20280455,Page 257

New Year Resolutions.
I
WILL not pay
Twopence to ride a little way.
* A very little way, I say,
A hundred yards it may
Be, in a tram!
Nor will I lend
My money to a friend.
To spend
On things I can't afford
To buy myself.
I will not shout
For any one, without
I suffer drought
In my interior
Economy.
I will not play
At bridge, and say,
'You take the bun!
See what you've done!
You are to blame!
You threw away the game!""
And let my face
Get red.
Nor eat to please
The cook, if she's
The sort
Who thinks you ought
To court
A dose of indigestion
In suicidal appreciation
Of her accomplishments.
I will not growl
Because my neighbour's fowl
Begins to crow,
To let me know
The moon is up
At half-past two.

Hot Air""
v\7E know by this that politics
Are full of strange surprises;
That reputations have been made
In all sorts of disguises.
There was a man who couldn't write
A sentence of dictation.
And he became in course of time
A Minister for Education.
Another, too, who couldn't tell
A turnip from a vulture;
And 'erstwhile he devekmed as
A Minister for Agriculture.
And quite a lot of similar
Instances could be quoted.
Where little men have suddenly
To office been promoted.
When things like this occur, well, then,
Give over all surmises.
Remembering the simple fact
That hot air always rises.
Nomenclature.
T.TE goes to thfi races at times, and
although only a small bettor, ver
seldom gets on a winner. He Is the pos-
sessor of a refined literary taste, and
to him all words are sources and foun-
tains of meaning.
His soul rebels at the outrageous
and lugubrious names that many of
the horses race under, so that, in no
circumstances, however good a horse
may be, and however strongly he may
consider its chances, if it has an inane
name he will not take a ticket on it
He prefers to lose his money on a well
named animal rather than encourage
preposterous nomenclature by backing
animals with uncouth"" names.
""Why can't they give horses some-
thing like the appropriate names they
give ships?"" he asks. ""Take that fine,
modern steamer the Manunda for ex-
ample. There we have, under a soft
sounding name, in a slightly disguised
form, it is> true, but still plain enough
for any one to discern, a recognition
of the fact that steamers these days
are not controlled from the bridge but
from the stokehole-not by the cap-
tain, but by the man under.""
Latest Fashions.
rpHE hair will be long and the dresses
shorter.
For this is the mandate of Fashion
to-day
Regarding the dresses, it's held that
they orter
Be shortly abolished, as things in tbo
way.
But be not afraid it will leave the
young ladies
As barely equipped as, let us say,
bowsers,
Already at seaside consortings the flap,
pers
Are strolling around in a blouse and
a trousers.
And what will become of the Lords of
Creation
In days that will come is a matter
of guesses;
Though It looks very like, to preserve
the distinction,
The Lords of Creation .will have to
wear dresses.
But still it may happen that out of
the conflict
There may come a truce in the mat
ter of swathing,
And each, at a conference, agree to
abide by
The costume at present they use in
the bathing.
Launch Guests.
SPRIGGS is a natty man. He likes
to have everything on his launch
trim and clean. He spends a lot of his
spare time polishing It up. Although
he is by nature a hospitable fellow, with
a desire to share his pleasures with his
friends, he now firmly declines to in-
vite any of them down the Bay for
a week-end's fishing.
""The last couple of fellows I asked,""
he says, ""quite cured me of the habit.
They walked all over the boat for two
days with muddy or sandy boots.
They scaled their fish on the seats.
They threw prawns' heads and rancid
worms all over the floors. Again and
again I tidied her up and implored
them not to make a fish and chips
rubbish bin out of the craft.
"" 'Don't worry,' they said, 'we'll clean
her up as spick and span as a new
pin when we get back to the anchor-
age!'
""But the anchor was scarcely down
when they were in the dingy with their
tackle and catch, and the lad rowing
them ashore. After we had cleaned up,
the boy and I started for home, heavily
laden with the portables.
""Tiley dashed past us in a taxi, bound
fpr the station, gaily waving their
hands to us.
""And they were fellows you'd think

at prosiding at tho mooting, introduced 'j
Tho Honorable H- PARKES, who was received wi
prolonged ohoering, said .ho fol t glad to bo prosont it
movement of this kind,.tho moro so from the ht
[ amount of interest ovlnced at this meoting. He to
it as some promiso of a sound national, feeling grow!
up in the country ; and ho boliovod tho object they h
tn.view would find many ? advocatos both within a
outside this building. (Ohoors) Tho, rosolution wi
which ho had been entrusted had . reference to -1
desirability of perpetuating tho farao of that gre
navigator, Jarnos Cook-(cheer*) j-:and perhaps it wou
; bo as, woll to road .tho rosolution at once. It was
' follows:- ""That, .having a regard to tho immer
benefits conforred upon mankind generally, and up
tho inhabitants of, those colonies in particular, by t
illustrious navigator. Captain Cook, it is eminontly di
to his memory that somo monument should bo .erect
I in this colony to porpetuato his great' fame
Gontlemen, ho continued, writers on political oconon
i tell us that the riahes of a nation do not consist. 0I01
I of hor collections of gold and silver, in her struotur
of brick and stono, or her works of wood and iron ; b
in tho labour and enterprise of hor pooplo. Wealth'
tho moans to human happiness, and any ono who co
tributos to those means contributes equally with tl
many who raise her material greatness. If tht
applied this truth to the subjeot of their meeting thc
would find that thoy wera employed in no moan wo:
in paying honour to ono who has contributed so milt
towards tho' material happiness of his fellowmen 4 an
suoh a man they would deem worthy of being held'
remembrance. Statues woro, in ono sonso, ominont
educators of high. value. They placed belora thai
Ano examples worthy of thoir ' imitation,'and pointi
out tho right paths for thom to pursue. Wh
thoy ' should do in contributing . to tho:
national monuments was, to seo that thoy wei
not'deceivod by ornamont, or led away by mbrotrloiot
.services. Thoy should boar in mind tho character 1
tho man, lils'position, and look'to his services ;, at
thon they should soe that the form and charaoter <
thoir mémorial wero worthy of tho man they, sought 1
commemorate. On tho morita of tho illustrious navlg
tor thoy now sought to honour, he thought thu
would bo very littlo difference of opinion, and still lo
as to tho object. Now, who was this Jamos Cook
He proBumod that the men .composing .this moetin
were men who obtained thoir living by manual labou
if so, thoy could bettor npprooiato him. Jamos Coo
was tho son of a poor farmer, and euroly a lad wi:
could, by his perseverance, raiso himsolf from a state i
hamblo to tho highost position. Among . navigator
was worthy . : uoth of their. ?.? sdmiratio
and their sympathy. (Prolongad cheam ) Thi
lad, in tho coursa oí timo, booamo oonnectad wit
tho leading traders of England, and advanced step li
step until lie became a conspicuous member of a dil
tinguishad profession. (Cheers.) And suroly th
members of that profession will find in him. Borai
thing to admire and much to, omulato. , But (ami
Cook bocamo ona of thoso illustrious bands'of mon, nc
conquerors of their follow men, but conquerors of no
territory, for tho habitation of, his fellow beings. O
this ground all Christian pooplo should join in paying
just tributo toona who, by his discoveries, contribute
so much to advaoca our. common civilisation. H
discovered tho vory land wo now. inhabit, and had it so
boon for his spirit, his genius, and his fortitude thi
land might havo long lingorod in darkness. (Qhters,
It was for those reasons that ho hoartily oongralu
lated thoso who had sot on foot this movomonl
a movoment -which ho bopod would not bo confine
simply to New fouth Wales, but ono that woul
embraco all -tho colonias, so that tho: subscription
might bo individually small, but extended as tar a
possible, that wo m ¡«ht raisa a monumont worthy 0
tho man, and an ornamont to tho colony. (Olieorj,
There could bo no Uifferonccs of opinion on this subjaol
no -sectarian or selfish, .differences. ? Every ilrlshmat
must appreciate his worth and his unselfish .spirit
Every Scotohman must, admiro that-indomitablo wll
with which ho persevered ""to tho attainmont ot hi:
object ; and Englishmen may bo proud that thoi:
countrymen have boen so ably personified by ono si
enterprising, so laborious, and illustrious. (Ohoors.
Ho hoped all would rocogniso, in this truo spirit, tht
worthiness of this objoot; and that each would
p rsuado his neighbour, BO that tho monoj
rrquirod would bo ' raised from tho wholo ol
tba pooplo of the colony. If twonty thousand
persons wqro to contributa ono shilling oach, thej
would hrive subscriptions equal to thoir requirements.
In England thoro roso a man, not immodiatoly from the
working classes so muoh as his ancestors, who, by hit
lifo, contributed much io tho happiness of tho people
by taking off a tax on tho broad >f tho pooplo. » Tho
people of Enif land havo recognised the worth of that
man, by oracling statues to his memory in nearly ovary
town, soma by penny subscriptions, and eomo bylargar
donations ; and on each of thoso monuments tho in-
scription was brief, but full of moaning, for there was
only ono word and that word was PUKL, (Prolongod
cheer?.) And ho heped that whon we erected a statuo
to tho momory of Captain Cook wo should imitate tho
oxamplo by putting on that"" Btatuo tho word COOK.
(Applause) Lot us thon 'do this work; 'lot
us * erect this statuo; lot it bo tho pooplo's

that'will not injure his fair fame; lot us do it as if 'wo

Tho country names that should deiorr« to live''
(Cheers.) And one of the first ¿arno« .""ho would giro to
any part of this great South ' land' was tho
name , of tko. illustrious .discoverer . of this
country, whom thoy were mut to honour. , (Oheors.)
He (Dr. Lang) once took .tho liberty. o£ affixing that
name ns tho titlo of a work ho.publlshod in London, in
1847, proposing af or expressing tho .usual difBdonco
that authors aro troubled, with,, thnt tho Moreton Bay
country should bo callod after that illustrious navigator
Cookslnnd. (Cheers) And although tho proposal had
been ridiculod in this country not rai little, Lady
Franklin, relict of tho famous polar. navigator, Sir
John, Franklin, who- had frequent opportunities of
hearing tho opinions of captains and admirals of tho
navy, and other official persons in Somerset .House, had
told'him (Dr.. Lang) ;.that those , naval .gentlonion woro
all highly pieasod at. tho idóa of,giving tho nomo of
our illustrious discoverer to Bomo portion;-of .this Aus.
tralian land, (Choers.) Evîh the Times nowspaper of
tho day npprovod of tho idea In one. of .their leading
articles. But tho DuVo of Newcastle, who had the
ordoring.of thoso .matters in his band, thought it
bettor that a second of our Australian colonies should
boar tho nama of her Mujosty tho Queou. He (Dr.
Lang) thought,' as tho namo of hor Majesty had been
already given' to ono colony. (Victoria),'that ona might
bo soared for tho nano of tho illustrious navigator;
but It was doemod othorwiso in ' high quarters. Tho
resolution put into his band ho would-now-read. --It
waa-""That a statue would bo a suitable momento, (ho
erodion - of-which-in a prominent place in this city,
would give tho'colonists an opportunity of recording
their appreciation of his groat, services.'.*.. He entirely
oonourrod in this idoa. It was tho most grateful modo
of expressing thoir rospoot for that illustrious man. Wo
havo in.this city two sta'ues. ono of that ominont Go
vornor Sit Riobard Bourke, and tho othor of tho
lato Royal Consort of her Majesty tho Quoon. It would
boagracoful not on' tho part of tho. colonists of New;
South Wales-whethor assisted by othor . colonies or'
not-to raise in this city a third statua for our illustri-
ous navigator. (Oheors.) Ho had no feara os lo tho
cost hoing met. byj tho pttbüo of this polony, ovon
though tho subscription wore limltod to a'comparatively
small .amount -not to oxosed £1. ooah (hoar, hoar),
which -ho was Börry to say was his .maximum. '"" (A
laugh.) no had that day 'received for an óbjoot that
interested thecitlzens of Sydney,; a widow's 'mite, an
envelope enolosinga shilling's-worth of stamps.' 'And
ha was as gratified at receiving it as if it containod
£20 or £50. Ho did not think there would ""bb any
objootions offered to tho >idca embodied
ia this resolution A status-was tho most-appropriate
mode ot expressing publia sympathy In regard to. tho

Mr. W. HANSON seconded tho resolution, no oaid
ho had not tba slightest idea of taking part in the-pro*
ceedings, but he . had no hesitation in seconding tho
resolution sa ably proposed by Dr. Lang/: Ho was suro
tho result of the movemont would be .great success in
the ' erection. of. thia memorial.' We could' soarcoly:
rjaliso tho difficulty this great < navigator - had
in accomplishing what I ho did. Sotting sail ? from
England without chart or maps, to direct his coarse, it'
was romarkabto that ho should have succeeded,- It was
something to be proud of that they had suoh a man as

with Cook. He had no suoh vessol as moro modern'

hs had no doubt that In o rory short timo tho work
would bo accomplished. It had boen Bald by a pro
vious speaker that Ibis great work bad beon too long
noglootod. Ila did not admit thoy had nogleotod it.
Ho had boon in this country twonty-olght years, and
during that timo ho had frequently hoard tho project

delayed, perhaps, too long; but ho would not admit it
had boon dolayad so long as to moko lt mora difficult

were now in a,botter position to erect a statué to Cook
worthy of the country and of that groat man, than thoy
woro fifty years ago, (Hear, hear.) Ho believed it
wasnover'too.'lato,to! do well, Ho hollered they had
now arrived at. o propor timó ¡n this country, and had
progroBBod to a position of wealth and intelligence which
entitled thom hpw.to.rc'cbgnÍBÓ thé merits of tho mon
who discovered ibis great continent . That it would be

E' ooplo, ho' had no doubt. .The,speakers who, preceded
¡rn hod, told them why.this work should be undertaken,
and ho would now give thom'his idea how it should be
carried out,; for on tho cornmittoo' would dbvolye tho
1 task of accomplishing tbs labour ' entrusted , to'them.
In tho first placo bo said that this great work of art
ought as'much a«: possible to, partake, of a|truly Aus-

of,; titnomsblvrs ' and, ' tho - man.', ¡' It might
bo said thoy had ¡not tba materials, to moko It an
Australian work of art Ho believed there'was no' doubt
.that.'ample'.materials. were to, be, found in this colony
alono for furnishing some great artist'of their father-
land tho moans of moulding them into form and sym-
metry for a'memorial to Captain Cook» But they need
hot confino, themselves' to this colony. .'It was on
Aiiatialianwork, and thoy might »oarob for tho mato
rials.in tho . adjacent colonies if they could not lina
thom hero.,' Ho happened this very ovooing to get into
conversation with a soiontifio gontleman of his oc
q'uaintanoo, who,w*B now.present, and he had furnished
him with tomo material whioh would save him from
makiug a speech. That gentleman told bim that they
had porphyry equal in boauty to Swedish, which, could
bo obtained' from. Port Stephens and Gabo Island. They
had marbles from Gladstono nnd tho county of Argyle,
equal to thoso of Spain.. ; Mr. Hovell know that They
had! granito, In abundance, and. in groater,,variety,
than-, in any other part ofT tho, world,
at Lake Bathurst In ornamental mutais,
or oros, , (in order to do honour to tho man, whoso eba
rooter deserved thoir admiration,), they had auriferous
qaartz ; in blooks o£ largo size., Tho had malachite
oqúal to tho famous products of Russia. In fact thora
was no material ihey. could not furnish, equal to any
to bo found In any part of tho, world. (Hear, hoar.)
Thora materials would bo admirably suited for the
pedestal of tho statue, and thoy would not require to
bring them from home. If tho statuo wai to be made
of metal they nood nos bo indebtod to any other country
to furnish it Thoy bad the purest copper and wero not
without tin. (Laughter and oheew.) So that they
could furnish tho components of .bronze, and if .silver
was wanted thoy could supply it from their own metal-
liferous rooks.. Tho propor way would bo for the
committee to Bad tho raw materials boro and send thom
to the mother country to bo operated upon thora, and
moulded into shape for the purpose of this croat work
(Hear, hoar.) He had no doubt that woola commend
itsolf to 'avery',person' in tho , country, and that
the..,! atatuo would , bo an object unequalled
in any : of . thoso colonies. Ho beliorod they
warb tho first to roako au offort to ereota atatuo, .and bo
hoped they ""would havo. tho honour of doing it in the

in his address that Englishmen. Irishmen, and Sootoh
mon, had great raasons for joining in a démonstration to
do : honour to Captain Cook. ' If tho natives of. tbo
fatherland had such reasons; what creator reasons must
.tho.natives of . this sunny land have. (Hear, hoar, and
ch eora,) He was only sorry ho did not soo more of his
fellow, countrymen to lake part'in this; great.niootiog.
(Hear, ,hoar.) Jt was a : reproach to tho native born
Australiana to have allowed this matter'to stand over
for so : long a° period. They owed much to Captain
Cook, who bari discovered this country which offered a
home to tho starving thousands of Groat Britain and of
Europe, and they ought, to bo grateful to him and
rovero. his memory. . (Hear, bear.) Ho had
much . pleasure in soconding. the rosolution,
and - thought; now tho movomont was- set
on foot; it would .not bo Buffered: to die ont Ho
boped tho gentlomen named on . tho oommitloo would
not allow tho matter to rast here, but endeavour to
make it of national interest, Ho should like to soo tho
names of tho loaders of tho working man in our great
mechanical cstnbllshmenta added to the cornmittoo, for
tho amount required was Bmail, and tboy had ampio
opportunities , of brioging it under tbs notice of
-those, whose; real work it should ba to enlist
themselves i,in - this : business..-.. Ha - did nob .think
thoy-should .ho satisfied with tho , simplo inscription:

Parkes, (but somothing to this offaot-"" This ovidonco
of a nation's gratitude is erected to tho memory of

.required to bo mentioned amongst the working olassos,

THE WAND OF GOD.
There were dust and heat on the ridges.
There were starving stock on the
plain;
The long lagoons were death traps,
Whose- live prey strove in vain.
There were clouds' in the sultry heavens.
Rolling al^n^ each day.
O'er the smoke of hungry bush-fir-?s.
Where the long-dry grasses lay.
Tough bueJimcn fought for their cattle.
Tireless, game, and grim;
And the Trnreen worked and waited,
And joked when hope was dim.
Bla^k days: Till, at last— the deluge '?
The lowering storm-clouds buipt.
Lifting tho pall of sorrow
That lay on a laid aceuret.
WhHt could be svrpptcr mu^ir.
Than the sound of the niching rain;
Filling the swamns ami gullies,
Flocvlin^ the thirsty vliin'.1
Cleansing the heart of BiifTV.ng.
Easing the weary brain !
Row fair is tiie altered land?--ap-\
One short month after rain!
The TTand °f a Master Paini-v
Ha* touched the ridge and plain,
Clothing them, as by magic.
In sofest green again.
C'.eav from thp scrub and paddock
Crimes the call of browsing kino:
And the fat calf stirs the. rushes,
''Ncith flowering lawyer-vine.

Tiie magpie nests and sings-,
Pr' 'Tii grassy swamps in the hollow
CnMio=. the whirr 'f wild-durks' wings.
What 'cares the blue crane fishing.1
'Tis horses, racing fast.
In -ieer delight of living,
isow drought, and want ave past.
Onco more, beside the myrtle,
The wild hog roots content:
The snowy blood-wood blossom'.
With parrots' hues are blent.
The sandal woods beneath them
Their creamy earpet shed,
And tea-trees vroo the water
With blooms of white and red.
The bear looks down from his arm
ch aii
On. deep lagoons below.
Where the blwk swan sails serenely,
And sweet blue lilies blow.
There arc powers of good and evil,
Vet dream not life is vain ;
And O! whilst the land is smiling
Thank God for Jlis j-ift of rain.

My soul's soul I must own you
Forever mine, my friend,
From June to life's December,
Not mine to have or hold,
But to pray for and remember.
The way"" is. short, O friend, *
That reaches out before us.
G.:d's tender heavens above us bend,
His love is smiling: o'er us.
A little while is ours,
For s Trow or for laughter;
I'll lay the hand you love in yours,
On the shore of the hereafter.

Nobody makes me crosser than Maisie,
Her soul is fat conceited, and lazy;
To-day ""You're stupid, or else you're wicked.""
I thought, and thinking it, something clicked;
A gateway opened, terribly small.
The whole me couldn't get in at all;
I left my usual self behind,
And wandered freely in Maisie's mind.
I saw her carpets and furniture,
Her window-boxes (and to be sure,
Her pansies don't make much of a showing,
But I never guessed that she liked them
growing);
And if her windows are far too small,
She's only a tenant, after all,
No alterations and scant repairs!
I saw her steep, narrow, corkscrew stairs,
And the place where the oilcloth's worn clean
out--
No wonder she doesn't like running about.
It wouldn't be safe in a soul like that,
And her padded armchairs conduce to fat.
I liked them, though-it was fun to see.
Click! I was back in the usual me,
Out of breath, but I feel much fonder
Of Maisie, now that I've been up yonder.
