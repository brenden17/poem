MAD POETS.
f1' Some people believe that all poots
tre. mad. ...' Poet's Corner,' ' Her
ald,'1 Christmas number.)
Long I've been a licensed poet ;
Editors have printed me ;
Paid for my poetic flow-it
Hasn't rippled easily.
Now, it seems, they are my nurses ;
Wardsmen, kindly, grave and sad,
Editing my various verses.
Me, poor me — ? Oh, I am mad !
I'm. a mad poetic writer,
Who can't do much good in prose.
My thoughts eeem to go off brighter
Blessed in printer's funeral clothes,
Accompanied by orchestral strumming,
Turn, turn, turning, grave and glad
Bees inside my bonnet, huming :
'Metaphorically mad!'
Strange enough, my keepers pay me
For my lapses (so absurd I)
Each one in an expert way, he
Knows where to exchange a word,
Where to huve a stop deleted.
How to blunt a caustic line,
With an ere for things completed
Just a bit more cute than mine.
^Whst of those who read with pleasure
My mad writings ; folk galore,
Who fill mind voids with good measure
Of escape from things that bore ?
This great host — is it so foolish
That it has to find a loon
And -with a, persistence muleish.
With it's loonatic commune t 1
Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! That's my gay humour;
All in my poetic flow,
Folk are thoughtless who assume a
Pool's mad. They do not know
Inmates of this world asylum
1^ Hide their kinks and vain regrets j
Kpoets, a* these 'sane' folk style them,
v Use their kinks and mental pets !

(To the Editor.) -:
Poor little woodland Dryad, your
death has been decreed,
And slaughter, fierce and' gruesome,
pursues you and your breed.
Depression among humans, starvation
rank and rife,
Takes toll of your poor body, your
harmless bushland life.
Forms of human females, your dovmy
fur will wear,
While 'heath the giant blue gum?,
your forms lie stark and bare.
No more your playful frolics will
echo 'mong the trees,
But ghost-like, fleeting shadows, will
mark your grim decease.
.Now snare aud shot and poison, dis
pensed, by human hands,
Will reap a gruesome harvest, 'mong
your depleted bands.
And human voices haggle across your
silent pelt,
Sans thought or swift cempassion, for
the agony you had felt
Society's dainty ladies will have an
added charm,
White shoulders be protected, and
snowy breasts more warm,
And filthy gold and silver, in bank
and den and mart,
Will signify tlie ceasing of the beating
of your heart.
Our women will look dainty, our men
will have more gold,
And drunken sprees betoken the furs
that have been sold.
. Soon only in museums, your dainty
form will lid
Poor, little woodland Dryad, for you
arc doomed to die.

I WOULD not nurse a lovely thought
apart;
Mine be the task supreme.
To whisper through the great world's
throbbing heart
The message of a dream!
Ah! glowing vision that intrigueth me;
Ah! gracious calm of solitary peace;
Yet Beauty, worshipped lone, might
barren be,
But shared, it hath increase.
O! Singer, dreaming on the mountain
height,
Take all the shining hours vouch-
safed thee there,
But still come back-thy soul aflood
with light,
And what God gave thee share.
Men are so weary of their treadmill
days,
They sigh even as they count their
barren gains!
A word-a breath-can lift to purer
ways,
And free them from their chains.
So if thy soul, athrill with ecstasy,
Sees some rare vision, deep at
Beauty's heart!
Lift up the veil that other eyes may
see
Nor worship, rapt apart.

They came of bold and roving stock that would
not fixed abide;
They were the sons of field and flock since e'er
they learnt to ride.
We may not hope to see such men in these de-
generate years
As those explorers of the bush-the brave old
pioneers.
'Twas they that rode the trackless bush in heat
and storm and drought;
'Twas they that heard the master-word that called
them further out;
'Twas they that followed up the trail the moun-
tain cattle made,
And pressed across the mighty range where now
their bones are laid.
But now the times are dull and slow, the brave
old days are dead
When hardy bushmen started out, and forced
their way ahead
By tangled scrub and forests grim towards the
unknown west,
And spied the far-off promised land from off the
ranges' crest.
Oh! ye, that sleep in lonely graves by far-off ridge
and plain,
We drink to you in silence now as Christmas
comes again,
The men who fought the wilderness through
rough unsettled years--
The founders of our nation's life, the brave old

Shout for the Governor, Council, and Judges,
Shout till each merry man marks not his fellow.

Men by the creeks, be they saltish or savoury;
March from your upper and nether cool fountains;
Of long beard, and thickened skin, haste ye and

Raze the grey stubbled field, gathered for ages,
Look as ye looked ere each wife was a matron;
Saddle your geldings for very long stages,
March, all in duty bound, thanking your Patron.

Boys very famous in history's story,

Shout for the Governor, Council, and Judges,
Shout till each merry man marks not his fellow.

THE CLOSE OF LIFE.
""Evil is wrought from want of thought
As well as want of heart.""
BEND closer, mother, for my voice is weak,
And I would speak a little ere I die.
I have been dreaming, mother. Is ar ilieam
I stood within the same old cottage porch
Where, in the summer evenings, yon and I
So often sat, and sewed and read br turns.
I looked toward the village, bnt a mist—
A thick, dense mist, that deadened every sound
And shut out every sight—was o'er tbe place.
Then while I wondered vaguely whence it came,
It vanished utterly, and I could see
The rosy sunset glinting on the cave
Of quaint thatched houses in the village street,
And fields a-golden with the ripening corn.
I heard the sheep-dog barking on the Mil-.
The lowing of the cattle in the vales.
And all the homely sounds of village life;
And you were with ue as you used to be,
The calm-browed mother of the olden days.
Awhile I stood as in a pleasant trance,
Tongue-tied for very Joy; then fell the mist,
and all was dark and silent as before.
Have I been long ill, mother * I have lost
AU count of time since that most awful night
When first I felt the horror of my fate.
And knew the gift thst most of all I prized,
The power of thought, was ebbing fast away -
And that the dread of auch calamity
But brought it nearer to me. I had borne
Weariness, cold, ay. hunger—they were all.
Bet side by side a ith thi* most deadly blow,
Bnt aa the sighing of the gentle wind
Is to the raging of the mighty storm.
I made one fierce, wild straggle for the light.
Then sank in total da-fr-i-a*.
_ _  Blame them 9 80,
They paid me fairly what they thought enough.
And if, from lack of health or lack of strength,
I failed to do my work, why they could count
On hundreds who would fill my vacant place,
Perhape at lower wagea They were born
To be our rulers, and will grudge no Jot
Of what they deem their birthright. Small or nest.
The godlike Intellect of power must bow *»--■-■-
Before the throne of Mammon. And because
Of all God's gifts it is most freely given,
Onr Mammon-worshippers make light of it,
At least in value of tbe things that serve
Their need or pleasure. If their horae or dog
Beem restless, heavy-eyed, or ill at ease,
WUI they not look to find a cause for it ?
And, side by side with theae dumb brutes, are wa,
Their human slaves, not worth a passing thfmgtit t
I see things clearer than I did of old.
And in a stronger light; a* d I have learnt
The lesson that a modern poet taught—
The aad. stern truth, that evil oftls wrought
As much from want of thought as want of htsvrt,
O for a Uttle of the fire and strength
That nerved the ancient prophets to' their work-
To roase this sleeping world to life agaia.
And teU the men who hold high place in it
That all Christ's lessons in two thouaand yean
Have failed to teach them common charity 1
That he who spends his talent on himself,
Without a thought for all the world beside.
Is worse thau he who hides and hoards it up.
> Tia useless til 1 For Dives feasts within
On richest.viands, served on choicest plate,
And Uttle recks that, by the outer gate,
The street-dogs lick the sores of Lazarus.
Nay, mother, lam calm; and if my weeds
Seem the outpouriags of an angry mind,
I am not thinking of myself, bnt those—
My fellow-sufferers in thia city here—
Who day by day toil far beyond their strength
To keep themselves above starvation point
Thirg you, because the world looks coldly on
And sees them suffer, Chri.t looks coldly too r
We know that not a sparrow falls to earth
Without His Father's knowledge. Least of ail
ShaU cruel or thoughtless wrong to those He loves
Escape Ilia righteous ire.
For me, tia o'e*.
My dream fulfils itself. The mist descends.
And hidea the memory of the Ufa that'a past.
Bat through the mist there shines a brighter light,
Where Jesu waits all mercy and aU love,
, To take the wayworn sheep into hia arms.",The Queenslander ,"628,389,655,426,693,584,741,671,692,680,659,773,723,777,567,587,772,686,688,602,672,668,711,622,715,603,685,741,638,717,748,591,687,691,705,605,594,726,460,814,774,762,740,731,671,647,863,861,732,648,708,655,746,638,657,812,829,603,693,642,731,797,594,804,674,696,759,710,679,702,733,672,693,636,660,699,655,663,613,746,690,731,750,690,742,823,403,258,707,726,822,654,687",Sat 12 Oct 1872,"773,934,992,1027,1082,1115,1172,1203,1238,1269,1302,1337,1370,1402,1436,1468,1502,1534,1567,1600,1635,1668,1699,1732,1764,1794,1854,1887,1920,1953,1987,2019,2055,2085,2117,2153,2186,2217,2249,2312,2338,2372,2403,2435,2468,2499,2532,2559,2597,2631,2665,2698,2731,2759,2797,2830,2863,2896,2931,2962,2991,3030,3085,3115,3150,3186,3216,3252,3283,3317,3350,3383,3416,3450,3483,3542,3573,3606,3639,3671,3706,3739,3772,3805,3838,3871,3904,3942,3969,4003,4036,4069,4104","5257,5364,5205,5236,5134,5101,5135,5101,5101,5099,5101,5099,5099,5099,5099,5098,5096,5098,5098,5096,5096,5096,5096,5098,5096,5096,5129,5096,5096,5094,5093,5093,5096,5096,5093,5094,5094,5096,5093,5094,5094,5098,5098,5096,5099,5098,5096,5098,5098,5096,5098,5098,5098,5099,5099,5096,5098,5099,5099,5098,5098,5099,5132,5099,5099,5101,5099,5101,5099,5101,5101,5088,5099,5101,5099,5134,5101,5101,5101,5102,5099,5099,5099,5099,5101,5099,5101,5652,5101,5099,5099,5101,5088",27273046,Page 7

AN AUSTRALIAN TALE OF A TUB.
(Period, July 14, 1835.)
A MERCHANT of Sydney, (such merchants, I ween,
As deal in rum wholesale, are everywhere seen;)
Stood aghast, at the door of a dealer-retail,
To hear from a puncheon this wonderful tale.
The puncheon was empty, and rolled to the door,
More empty, more loud,--""Have I met you once
more,
My last and kind master, and thou, my old friend,
Hear a story,"" quoth puncheon, ""I pray you attend.
""On ship-board, my brethren and I heard the rubs
Of sailors, who called us ""the devil's own tubs;""
Who yet condescended to ask for our aid
The moment the signal for sailing was made.
""And visited me and another so oft,
That soon not a man could take turn up aloft:
But some of the scorners were thrown from the yard;
And, to hold in the mischief, the hold was well barr'd.
""So we sail'd unmolested to fair Sydney Cove,
And first heard your voice, sir, exclaim from above,
'Forty puncheons of rum, mark X, crowfoot, O,
To be sent to the stores of John Wholesale and Co.'
""The duty all paid, I remember full well,
The guage in my side my dimensions to tell;
And how long they chatted of gallons and proof,
And dues for the country's good use and behoof.
""This wrong I resented: Oh, once give me leave,
Good folk, you'll pay double, said I, in my sleeve.
Then brought to the store, I had not rested long
Before you accused me of being too strong.
""Advised my depletion, and water'd my blood;
But, fearful of losing a drop of what's good,
The surplus you took from a brother and me
You gave to a third, and we two became three.
""So ready for sale, and bound down to a dray,
I came to the place where you met me this day,
And sent to the cellar, I felt rather glum,
I knew I was nothing but water and rum.
""Mine host gave me cooling enough for a frog,
And changed my condition to two-water grog;
But to keep me from dying, presented a jug,
Containing a potion of stimulant drug.
""Now drawn through a pipe, on the counter I sped,
To prey on the vitals, to dizzy the head;
To beggar the husband, the father, the wife
To lay hold of reason, to seize upon life.
""To nerve the assassin, the prisons to fill;
Like-pistols and swords I was licensed to kill.
I drew upon Death, and he honor'd the bill,
'Twas a draft signed by Alchohol, Brothers, and Still.
""Since I saw you good sir, the bell has toll'd thrice,
For men whom I sent from the world in a trice:
One felo-de-se, one cut short at his door,
One shot while obtaining more rum at a store.
""And many more hasten reverses to meet,
Of health, mind, and morals--but Rum is so I sweet
They still call for more, and the temperate men,
Will run the career of the drunkard amain.
""So though I am empty, and my work is done,
You still may buy spirit by puncheon and tun;--
A new race arrives, unwarn'd by the past,
You'll sell your consignments, and get money fast.
""Remember good sirs, (as I bid you farewell
And haste to the place where old mammon doth dwell,)
I leave you a token, the merchant shall find,
His clerk has embezzled--his wife is unkind.
""For both have just tasted--your liquor they took.
Then why, merchant, why, give that horrified look?
On an errand of mercy, you sent me to roam,
Then why not receive my kind visits at home?
""And you, Mister Pub., must now pay up the score,
Contracted by mixing and drugging me sore;
Your boy is a drunkard, but ten years of age,
And wife drams a little her grief to assuage.
""And you, though so sober, because you abstain,
Will soon taste a little and follow the twain;
And so making congé to bid you adieu,
I'm clear in discharging my duty to you.
''Farewell, for the present, I'll see you again;
In sicknss, a story alleviates pain;--
I'll call again, then, and be in at the death;
I'll prove a near friend at your last drawing breath.
""So not to detain you--haste, haste on your way!
Eternity's length, and the great Judgment day,
Will grant us a meeting and then I can state
The fullest results of the tale I relate.""",The Colonist ,"1041,773,649,1022,1013,891,987,1089,1063,159,1063,1119,1050,1104,1048,934,762,988,1103,1086,983,1063,984,1088,889,1057,1033,1075,1052,1086,1003,894,1029,918,914,1007,983,1071,1011,871,1058,1030,942,1111,1088,940,905,1051,844,995,1102,1065,1071,1058,840,965,896,1079,1006,983,984,1061,1016,1058,1066,1097,1078,977,1036,1079,926,953,1059,985,935,1080,1125,1020,1032,842,986,1032,1061,1048,1066,1059,1055,948",Thu 16 Jul 1835,"1795,1857,1917,1972,2019,2068,2116,2197,2245,2305,2341,2390,2453,2511,2559,2605,2681,2730,2779,2827,2899,2942,2997,3045,3119,3162,3218,3261,3345,3394,3441,3489,3575,3624,3672,3721,3805,3852,3898,3949,4033,4084,4128,4176,4247,4288,4344,4392,4475,4522,4572,4619,4697,4744,4792,4845,4928,4974,5024,5072,5147,5196,5243,5287,5373,5417,5516,5563,5639,5690,5741,5784,5866,5918,5967,6008,6092,6141,6188,6231,6314,6361,6408,6444,6537,6580,6631,6680","3907,4053,4174,3898,3901,3898,3897,3896,3923,3959,3895,3897,3897,3897,3896,3895,3896,3894,3894,3894,3895,3892,3895,3895,3894,3883,3888,3895,3910,3892,3892,3893,3893,3893,3892,3887,3892,3887,3890,3890,3890,3888,3890,3890,3889,3887,3886,3887,3927,3887,3887,3894,3886,3887,3888,3887,3884,3887,3884,3880,3886,3880,3885,3888,3887,3877,3878,3885,3883,3878,3883,3880,3882,3881,3882,3880,3881,3881,3882,3881,3884,3905,3884,3887,3884,3885,3879,3887",31716722,Page 6

I THE SPELL OF THE WESTERN
PAWN.
Oh! I've been held by a wondrous spell
while the dawn line spread its arc,
[While I restrained a quadruped haif
on for an equine lark.
I've loved the zest of the dawn out
west, but now, here in the towns
The steeds I know are tired and slow,
poor work-worn bays and browns.
So while the dawn is lifting the cast
I lie and picture scenes
Hade up of men and camps and gear
and equine kings and queens.
In here the rows and miles of homes
blot out the lift of dawn
That outback fades and widens away
like night-worn blinds. withdrawn;
And none here knows of the winds that
blow like nectar night distilled.
J4nd all the prance and eagerness of my
steeds has long been killed.
So while I hear poor milk cart slaves
here breaking the dawn's soft hush
I let my vagrant mind go back to those
camps in the dawn-lit bush.
facing the morn, while the arc of dawn
rolled back for the coming day,
J*ve felt entranced while a live steed
danced, but I hadn't a word to say,
For thought, is small in the silence, all
too full of a sense of awe
That holds while the dawn is lifting its
spell in the thrill of the short
wind raw,
Bo while I etch my pictures here while
day breaks int^ the room
J know the spell of the western dawn
as it rolls back the night-time's
gloom.

BACK TO ZENDA.
Through Rurltania's valleys,
No more the war-notes ring,
No rebel Elphberg rallies
In arms against his king.
No word at midnight spoken
Bids loyal swordsmen ride.
Time and wild war have broken
The princes and their pride.
Yet still in Ruritania
When fairy lights are lit,
A princess like Titania
May at her window sit.
Still mounts the traveller daring
A throne, If not for long,
And proves, through love's despairing,
A king can do no wrong.
Strange kingdom, never charted
On maps that schoolmen know,
It hath not all departed,
Your pomp of long ago.
O land of lost renownlng,
While youth's last star endures,
Twill glisten for the crowning
Of summit- such as yours.

My eye rests on some trav'ler
Ever trudging slowly by.
And I pause and stare and ponder
Till my own hard lot seems fair
In tbe rise and force of pity
For the homeless son of care.

Moves a speck I can't distinguish
Though I stare and stare again
Till the speck with hours enlarges
And approaches slowly nigh,
When, ah ! in want and patches,
There's a trav'ler trudging by.
Dragging onward, dragging slowly,
With the water-bag sucked dry ;
Oh, my heart bleeds for the trav'ler,
Struggling ever, struggling by.
At night when storms are raging
And the gullies rise and roar,
Falls a footstep and a stumble,
Then & rattle ftt the door ;
And a voice that's weak and husky
Craves a crust and tea supply—

SIR,
Sat verbum Sapienti.
I have amused myself in speculating
in what degree acts the benighted effu-
sions and ribald language of two of your
eloquent and sapient contemporaries on
the minds of the native youth in this
Colony, and I am come to the conclusion
founded on the pliability of youthful
minds, and their aptness before maturity
to take impressions of vice or virtue,
that these worthy co-partners in base
calumniation, and ill-judged scurrility
is that Basilisk, whose malign influence
is detrimental to the virtue and morality
if the Australian youth. Perhaps you
may consider this too cimmerian an hypo-
thesis--too Utopian. But in order to
establish this, and to convey to the reader
that it amounts to an axiom, I will illus-
trate by observing, that the disseminating
of factious and seditious notions (espe-
cially countenanced and supported by the
pen of juggling priestcraft) against an
administration such as we enjoy under
Governor Bourke, is ever the means of
wheedling young minds from their proper
occupation, and perverting the natural
courses of good understandings from the
channels of duly and of virtue. The
idea of a democracy, oligarchy, republic,
or aught else, would be pleasing, because
of its breaking monotony, it would be a
thing to talk of--something that would
affect and keep alive speculation, and
divest the mind of lethargy; there would
be in it something so new, so strange,
and astonishing, that it would especially
take hold of the feelings of the young and
thoughtless; and like the fatal fascina-
tion of the rattlesnake, would draw them
voluntary victims into the jaws of fearful
and certain destruction--romance and
enthusiasm are strong qualities in youth-
ful minds; and these heightened by for-
tuitous circumstances, and inflamed by
the daring and uncompromising spirit of
party zeal, become the foundation of a
mind reckless to the well being of govern-
ment, or of social order. It is by the
schismatical doctrines of priests, and the
forcible appeal to our baser passions,
through a corrupt press, that men are
formed for the commission of bold acts,
in open violation of government. If the
press, which should direct the energies,
and form the mind of our native youth,
be prostituted to the exaction of tyranny
against the unfortunate and oppressed,
and the dissemination of lawless mea-
sures, and truculent animosity against an
approved government, we may fairly con-
clude the sad example before the eyes of
Australians will be any thing but condu-
cive to quietude or national prosperity.
I will conclude by observing, it is the
quality--the acting principle of rebel-
lious spirits to lead by their insidious arts
the unwary in the meshes of their guilt,
by cunning and fascinating accounts of
speedy and certain success--the blazing
glory and cushioned ease of power and
ambition. If these arts fail, they mag-
nify the evils of existing things; and
awaken the passions by a forged tale of
tyranny and oppression. All this, most
men of matured understanding can guard
against, and here villainy is cowed by the
bold front of strong discernment. It is to
the gay, the young, and thoughtless, it
looks for support, and among them it finds
the ready victims of folly and presump-
tion. Mercenary wretches, who have
sprung from the canaille--unprincipled
and degenerate caitiffs, who, to screen
villainy, fled ere the arresting hand of
justice had stayed their career, are among
these men (who have become wealthy by
extortion and oppression), who are the
leading members--the acting agents of
that demon sedition, which we must sup-
press. So look ye, Australians, that you
are not led away by the plausible flattery
and golden dreams of mad ambition; nor
make your country the scene of havock
and confusion, but turn your ears from
these levellers, who, under the cloak of
sanctity and morality, carry hypocrisy,
malice, and sedition. Underneath I send
you a few lines, the fragment of a poem
on ""Sydney,"" conveying a timely hint
to the ""faction.""
Far o'er a wide and boundless Ocean borne,
Sometimes becalmed, and sometimes in a storm,
These shores I sought, these distant shores scarce
known,
To ages past--and not all in our own.
Surprised and pleased I viewed th' expansive bay,
And saw where num'rous gallant vessels lay
Secure at anchor. And the busy throng,
Alive to trade and speculation strong,
Moving upon the different wharfs that line
The shore--the infant quays, a pleasing sign
Of mightier efforts in a future time.
And here, says I, scarce fifty years have past,
Since enterprising man commenced the task,
Of rearing in this distant place a town,
Whose rising greatness marks the sure renown--
The boasting glory of a time unborn,
When all the burly and the vengeful storm,
Of fierce sedition and the factious broil
Of party shall have ceased their loud turmoil.
When virtue lifts her head, and vice that erst
With hands reluctant grasped the plough to burst,
The untilled soil shall cease to he the slave
Of despotism, or the sordid knave--
When on the pinions of the restless wind,
The flag of amity floats unconfined,
And civil discord and dissention rash,
With enterprise and commerce no more clash,
When Heralds big with empty bubbles choose
No more to mar good order, and confuse
The social state of things, and cease to vent
Their fulsome dogmas breeding discontent,
When juggling priests, and hypocrites assume
The guardianship of virtue, and presume
To mount the rostrum and pollute the fame,
Preaching contention--not the holy name,
Or acts of him, whose good and peaceful life,
Was never tinctured with the blood of strife,
When these shall cease to walk in evil ways,
And sanctify their calling in the praise
Of amity and charity the best,
And fairest virtues in the human breast:
Then Australia, and not till then thou'll rise,
The greatest nation 'neath these southern skies.

Gulnarbar, May, 1892.
The moon and its broken reflection
And its shadows shall appear
As the symbol of love in heaven,
And its wavering image bere.
Longfellow.
The dying light pales slowly in the west;
The shadowy silent presence of the night
Is stealing on to still the world's unrest,
And one by one the myriad stars shine bright,
From her dim realm in calm serenity,
The goddess of the night with peaceful grace
Lifting her pallid, gleaming shield on high,
In regal grandeur takes her silent place.
And through the dimness vast, Night seems to say
In, whispers low, "" Fear not my shadow, Death;
For as from earth I bear thy thoughts away
To dreamland for a space; so when thy wreath
Of life is wrought, cold Death shall close thine eyes
And bear thee to eternal Paradise.""",The Queenslander ,"866,483,672,542,419,216,361,587,483,537,485,222,683,683,659,768,620,741,712,663,820,792,721,786,855,587",Sat 7 May 1892,"380,888,1025,1076,1162,1882,1921,1244,1280,1312,1345,1376,1424,1455,1490,1521,1554,1587,1620,1654,1685,1718,1753,1784,1817,1854","395,575,476,543,603,1022,400,531,567,531,565,1014,369,402,369,402,369,402,369,400,369,402,369,400,369,369",19823768,Page 881

6.8 the sparks of a fire fly up .-avd,
So man uu'-o trouble is horn t
But the darkest hour of night time
Comes just before the dawn.
We live in a world of changes,
And suffering, bravely borne,
May bring us, far from its shni-w
To joy in the smiling morn.
Haply most prized possessions
Take wings and vanish away,
Or the cherished aim of a lifetime.
Fails to attain its s-.vay.
Friends well-beloved may falter,
' Children, with hearts estranged
Tread in the paths of folly,
And Oh ! How our world is
changes.
It seems that man battles vainly,
As one that beateth the air,
However he strive and labour ,
In search of a havon fair.
'Tis then that the soul gives challenge
To the blight of a blank despair,
And the door of a mightier kingdom
Swings wide at the call of prayer.
The same God sifteth the matter,
Who knowB when the sparrows fall.
The winds and the waves obey Him;
His hand is over all.
God with us, who is against us ?
Oh, for vision to understand.
And match with the host victorious
On to the Promised Land.
We look for a fairer country,
Where many mansions are:
Of beauty, grand and glorious,
Beyond our dreaming far.
Sweet hope, serene, immortal,
Shall dwell in the human breast,
Till our hearts have ceased their beat
ing,
And tired, we sink to rest.
Let us trust and work in patience,
That nothing on earth can tire;
And the Lord, Who is love eternal,

Up with the Flag! Each crimson
Wet with the heart's-blood of our best!
We still can die. We still can hold
Our kinship with the men of old.
We stood the test.
With sword half-drawn all Europe saw""' -
Our sons -go down on veldt and crag.
And traitors, cafe within the law,
Smiled as our handß grew weak in war.
Up with the Flag !
Up with the Flag ! For round it clings
The Shamrock, red with blood.
And Death has splashed with scarlet rings
The war-worn Thistle's downy wings,
And drenched the 'Maple-bud.
The battle-dew's on Leek and Rose,
And Heather of the crag,
All stained and torn the Myrtle shows,
And red with blood the Wattle blows :
Up with the Flag !
We wrought for Peace. The war-storm
broke —
They deemed us thralls.
Unarmed, we reeled before the stroke—
A handful in the cannon-smoke ;
And fierce and fast the rifle spoke :
"" An Empire falls !""
Then came a shout that shook the sea,—
One ringing word—
And Nations leapt to life, to be
One race, one arm for Liberty,
And grasped the sword.
White Dove of Peace, the Wilderness
Of many lands by us was won.
Strong in defeat and in success,
O make us wise in nobleucss
Now war is done.%
Wise in our strength that foesTnay learn,
On veldt and crag,
To love the Flag to which we turn.
Long shall it wave, bright shall it burn !

There has been (says "" Lloyd's Weekly"")
an interesting sitting of the Academy of
Medicine in Paris. Laborde, in presenting
the cast of the head of Vacber, the shep
herd killer, who was guillotined for many
horrible murdeTS perpetrated on shepherd
lads and girls, stated that Vac-her's brain,
presented the morphological characteristic.
of a "" superior brain."" It was comparable
to that of Gambetta. Laborde said that
in other conditions Vacher might have been
a great orator, and a useful citizen, Just as,
also in other circumstances, Gambetta might
have been a great criminal. Vacher was,
he concluded, irresponsible, but the Lyons
experts who declared be was not 'insane
will doubtless defend their report
before 'the academy, the necessary permis
sion having been voted.
The working of the various industries,
both in the United Kingdom and America,
is every day becoming more a matter ol
huge combines. Just now in England the
textile trade is being extensively worked in
this direction. The worsted spinners of the
West Riding of Yorkshire have combined
into a concern which will include 75 per
cent of the trade, with a capital of
£18,000,000. The worsted dress manufac
turers are projecting a cqmbine with a
capital of £20,000,000, while two other com
bines are on the stocks, eacn with a capital
of several millions—namely, the Lancashire
Bleachers' Association and the Association
of Lace Curtain Manufacturers. These
huge trusts should give a splendid lessor*
in economics during the next few years.
In the meantime the opinions of financiers
as to their success or failure differ widely.
Their opponents claim that their huge capi
talisation is dangerously Inflated, inasmuch
as it has been based on recent tat years, and
that the killing of competition will destroy
a stimulant of great value. On the other
hand, supporters of the combination claim
that it commands the very best management
poßßible, while the economies resulting from,
concentration are enormous. In the mean
time a satisfactory feature in connection
with the running of these concerns is that
wageß continue to advance.",The Queenslander ,"241,444,768,804,769,671,376,901,755,701,813,389,814,628,852,753,596,731,500,791,787,389,871,146,477,819,676,745,416,812,393,649,617,488,751,617,650,594,399,848,387,729,845,445,855,898,898,874,898,896,896,896,899,899,899,898,899,895,899,898,893,877,475,858,896,895,896,896,896,897,898,899,871,899,873,897,899,896,893,899,897,899,898,880,898,899,898,898,899,899,899,875,896,899,557",Sat 16 Jun 1900,"2609,4550,2726,2764,2800,2844,2893,2928,2969,3009,3050,3093,3170,3211,3252,3293,3335,3373,3417,3457,3498,3537,3617,3658,3698,3737,3776,3822,3861,3902,3943,3984,4025,4068,4140,4181,4222,4261,4296,4339,4384,4424,4465,4504,4650,4693,4735,4778,4819,4861,4902,4946,4987,5028,5069,5110,5153,5194,5236,5279,5320,5362,5405,5452,5494,5535,5578,5619,5658,5701,5742,5784,5825,5866,5907,5950,5991,6033,6074,6115,6156,6198,6239,6283,6323,6365,6406,6449,6491,6532,6573,6614,6654,6694,6737","3395,3474,3077,3156,3077,3077,3307,3076,3148,3080,3072,3310,3076,3153,3077,3077,3309,3074,3309,3077,3079,3313,3072,3110,3312,3072,3072,3080,3313,3074,3310,3077,3074,3302,3077,3153,3079,3077,3310,3076,3312,3079,3077,3309,3110,3072,3072,3072,3072,3074,3074,3074,3071,3071,3071,3071,3071,3072,3072,3072,3074,3071,3071,3107,3071,3071,3071,3071,3071,3071,3071,3071,3074,3071,3071,3071,3071,3074,3077,3071,3072,3071,3072,3071,3072,3071,3072,3072,3071,3071,3071,3071,3071,3071,3071",18549935,Page 1127

THE clouds drop low as they speed along,
The rain descends both steady and strong:
Creek and gully are rising fast;
Over the forest a misty veil is cast.
And the wind in its strength, as it sweeps past,
Leaves tossing branches and waving grass.
Without a pause the rain falls swiftly down,
Darkening tbe air, inundating tbe ground;
Now scattered around in clouds of spray,
Now falling in a steady, persevering wsy;
No rift in the dull gloomy canopy,
Wind and rain to-day hold- high revelry.

A OOsnoAL twin story is reported from
Dublin. A barber was waited npon one morning
by a nice young gentleman, who desired the
hairdresser's lowest terras per week for keeping
his comely caput in condition. A moderate aum
eras named and accepted. Thereafter the new
customer appeared regulary every day for a
•""close shave,** with frequent additions of sham
pooing and nsireutting, and often twice a day.
I In short, the barber marvelled mneh at the
rapidity with which this young man's beard and
[ hair grew, and the mystery waa only solved after
a considerable lapse of time, when one day "" two
of him "" came into the shop at once for s shave.

minded in a most striking manner of the
pbflosophiosi fee which a burglar once paid to

Bicherton, wbo Uvea on the Snow HiU Pike,
hearing that burglan wen about, purchased a
big bull-dog, and put a new lock of approved
and patented construction upon bis stable door.
Within a week from that time his dog had been
poisoned, and tbs patent lock picked, and his

Walter, and the kind-hearted lawyer not only
pleaded his cause, but gained bis acquittaX
After tbe trial the prisoner approached Sir
Walter, and having thanked him for his servioe
rendered, said, —"" lam aory I cannot give you
a fee in money auch as yon deserve; but I wiU
give you two items of information whioh may
be of value to yon in the time to oome, especi

a house is a better protection than a big dog
outside. Second, —there's no lock that gives a

Gbobob Samtsox's Haijwhht.—Who oan
teU where the joy from a weU-timed gift even of
a halfpenny may end P "" Fifty yean ago,"" aays
Dr. Spencer T. Hall, the "" Sherwood Forester ""
of literature, "" when I was a Uttle fellow in
corduroys, on going down by the brookside into
Button town on an errand, I dropped a halfpenny,
of some money entrusted to me for a purchase,
into the water, and aa it waa past recovery, I
was nearly broken-hearted with fear of the
possible punishment to follow—not for the loss
of the copper, but for csreleesness and delay,
as tbe Uttle errand waa urgent. At this j uncture
George Sampson, son of a respected widow
residing at Smedley's End, and himself, though
working in a' *toeking loom,' one of the most
respectable youths in the parish, oame by, when,
touched by my grief, he gave me a halfpenny
from his own pocket with a kindly emile, and
walked on. I have many a time wished it were
possible to make bim some adequate return for
my then joy. I' tried it on' once by sending
bim afree ticket to one of my lectures at Mansfield,
but stiU felt be wss un-repsid tiU three or four
evenings since, as I was going down Manchester
road in Burnley. There a tender chUd, about
five yean old, with a small milk tin in its hand,
was sobbing as if its heart would burst, and
after it had passed me some time I learnt that
its grief was from not daring to go home through
having lost a halfpenny. In one flash of memory
I saw the old brookside at Sutton, tbe little
wavelets of water and the yellow sand that had
obscured my own halfpenny half a century
before; and tbe image of dear George Sampson
was there too, with his kindly look as he gave
me another. Retracing my steps I soon found
1 thb Uttle child-girl—standing in terror against a
I dead waU in a by-street, not knowing whioh
j way to turn from fear of a flogging if she went
home without the ' mUk for the baby.' In tbe
name of George Sampson, I msde thst child as
happy as he had once made me. If he be
Uving I trust he wUI bear of the good that half
penny so well bestowed in his youth may still ■
be doing; and if he be gone, let his example
teach young Sutton and Mansfield bow much
joy a timely act of kindness, however alight,
may perpetuate."" It may be added that George,
who in younger days was noted for assisting in
the Sutton Church Sundsy school and occassion
aily helping the ringen and the choir, at weU aa
for never looking at a child without a smile or a
pleasant word or act of aome kind, ia stiU Uving
in aa honorable old age at Mansfield. How
Uttle could be have dreamed, when unostenta

TASTES AÎÎD OPINIONS.
(From Bentley's AliuelUtny, for June 1844..}
A NEWSPAPER maintaining perfectly impar-
tial opinions in politic» being as difficult to dis-
cover as the philosopher's stoiie, it is proposed
that two edi toi s, of eminent abilities, but of
diametrically opposite opinions, shall conduct
these pages, so that those who like to contem-
plate every view of every subject shall thus
have an opportunity to do so, while such per-(
sons as feel, like the Irish judge,'tiiat to hear
both sides only confuses them, may crnfine
their studies to that which pleases them best.
All reports favourable to either party shall be
confidently stated on one page, and ns conn,
dently contradicted on the other. During evei y
election the probable state of the poll shall he
calculated and conjectui ed with a totally oppo-
site result on corresponding columns ; and, in
discussing the state of Ireland, it shall be de-
scribed on the one side us perfectly peaceable,
and on the other as being evidently on the verge
of a rebellion.
In reviewing hooks, announcing fashionable
changes, or recommending shops, this principle
I shall be rigidly adheied to ; and even a ballot at
a club ein only bo mentioned in those columns
where voting by ballot is advocated.
It is hoped that by thus embracing all par-
ties, "" The Whig and Tory"" may( secure uni-
versal patronage, and that by concentrating the
very essence of all foreign and domestic intelli-
gence, it will entirely supersede all rivals, being
indisputably recognized as the only "" True Sun""
calculated to enlighten ; "" The Times"" to be
the universal ""Standard"" of public opinion;
"" The Record"" of truth ; "" The Chroniclo"" and
"" Herald"" of a brighter morning than ever
before dawned upon the British Empire.
POLICE-OFFICE.
A case, which excited considerable amuse-
ment, was heard in Bow-streef yesterday, when
an old Irishwoman was hrpught up, chaiged
with making a violent assault on her next-door
neighbour, a young girl, also.frpm tbej Green
Isle/ She had torn tfjo bowsccuit of her anta-
gonist's cap, atid finally cut her severely with a
kmle.
"" Surely,"" observed the Magistrate face-
tiously, ""such a belle as you never,can want a
BEAD 1"" (Laughter.)
""An"" sure, your, honour, isn't Bow-street
the very place to come lo for one?"" (Roars of,
laughter.) ' _ ,
"" ' ""'You are'at a loqs for an answer, I see I""
f1 Nor nobody need he here, yofpr honour, that
can say Bo to a goose."" t (Shouts of laughter.:)
; *« You deserve the bow-sttjngjfor your, impu
dence,! t But wo must ti y what a few weeks in
Newgate will do.""
"" That's a New-gait to me, youl honour, and
a very awkward gate too. If'tvveie a five-barred
one 1 'd clear it anyhow ; but I don't agree with
confinement."" (Laughter.)
"" Thon, why don't you agree better with your
neighbours ? It is a serious business to use a
knife, und gives them a strong handle against
youl""
"" I only outs my disagi eoable acquaintance
in the sti eet, as the quality does.""
"" But, then, it was on this occasion cut and
come again.""
"" No knife can be sharper than your honour's
wit, anyhow 1 Sure it 's rutting and maiming
of me that you are, as the leg of mutton said to
the carving-knife. Long life, and many of them,
to your lordship 1""
The culprit was led away, amid shouts of
applause, evidently elated that in the war of wit
she had the hest of it, and obviously satisfied
that the glory covered the disgrace.
VERSES ON A CONVÓLVULOS,
By Lady Adelaide Fiiz Maurice.
There's not a flovv'r of radiant hue,
With tiut more bright than thine of blue j

And when we pluek thy stem so --light,

For soon it withers in a glass,/ , '

plished authoiess of these beautiful gems, (who

LITERARY INTTLLICENCE.
At a meeting of the Boyal Sfoeiety on Mon-
day last, Dr. Cot read some interesting re-
marks on the variations of the pulse occasioned
by people standing on their heads. Pi olessor
Altitude afterwards produced an elaboi ate i ssay
on the present alteration of our atmospheie oc-
casioned by an invisible oomet having lecently
crossed our orbit ; on which he analysed a por-
tion of air, and proved that a new species of
gas had supeivened, which hits a remaikablc
tendency to irritate the temper, nnd to render
people quarrelsome. Mr. Mackenzie then de-
monstrated that we shall have thirteen snow-
storms this winter, one of which will be seven
I feet deep on the 4th of June.
We are desired to intímate that the Royal
Society is now finally dissolved, having nothing
more to learn or to discover.
COURT CIKCULtR.
Some events of considerable importance are
now in agitation, which will cause great sur
! piise in certain qunrters, and must be followed
by consequences of which it is impossible to es
t'unate the ultimate importance. We forbear
for the present to be more explicit.
It is confidently reported that the second son
of a certain Baronet at tho west end of the
town is about to lead to tho nymemal altar the
daughter of an eminent mcicantile character,
who lives not a bundled miles fimn the city.
The venei able Lord C.uler-Idi is has, with
his usual liberality, desii ed a cat t of coals to
bo distributed among his njimi i ous poor te-
nantry near the villuge of Barmouth.
[ A dnerthemenl.]
Mrs. Smith has begun her course of dinners
for tho season. We understand she lias had
apologies fioin several invited puests of the first
distinction, and expects onÍFrnlay next two
Polish Princes, and several Members of Par-
liament. |
PUBLIC DINNER ANO TESTIMONY.
A gold watch and appendages was presented
yesterday to Monsieur Philips, the celebrated
French conjuror, on account of his recent exer-
tions for the public amusement^ and a dinner of
his friends and admirers took ¿lace at the Crown
and Anchor tavern. On this occasion he exhi-
bited a few novel and amusing tricks, having
turned a gentleman's coat without the wearer
being conscious of it. He also threw a quan-
tity of ribbon, silk, and huelo am into a huge
wheel, when imiiediately several beautifully
shiped, fashionable bonnets>wire produced ;
and he undertook, when any lady hail turned
her silk driss luke, to bring tout a thud hide,
which should look as good as new. To con-
clude the evening, after returning thanks for
the honour done him by the ladies and gentle-
men present, who were 710 conjurors, hu pro-
posed as a toast, with true French gallantly,
""Petticoat government; being the only legiti-
mate government which has continued uninter-
rupted since the creation."" Tune-""And ye
shall walkin silk attne."" ,u
niOH-FLVINO EXTRAORDINARY.
During the 1 ite severe hurricane, a remark-
ably fine hoy, ten years of age, was observed on
his way to school, when turning a sharp corner
towards Westminster Bridge, the wind sud-
denly caught his umbrella, a<id blew him ra-
pidly along tow aids the new Houses of Parlia-
ment. He clung tenaciously to the handle, till
a violent blast lifted him at length from the
ground, and, when last seen, le was flying over
the roofs of some houses in Hyde Park Place,
towards Bayswater. The distance rendevod
him at last invisible to the nil.ed eye ; but if
any one can send intelligence which may re-
store bim to his afflicted parents« a handsome
reward shall be given. ¡ *

A Public Meeting of Ladies took place in
Exeter Hall jestcrday, to consider the best
means of relieving and utterly abolishing all
cases of distress, when a Committee of Ways
and Means was appointed, and a subscription

sent devoted th""insehes to ti weeks'hard labour
to further the objects of the meeting.
Among the generous contributions on this
occasion we observed 130 pin-cushions, 310
purses (empty), 49 cigar cases, 590 dolls, and

trust, theieibre, that he may long continue to
""Raise the wind,"" and spiead out his canvass
before a favourable breeze.
IMPORTANT DISCOVERT.
A Smoothing-iron, on a perfectly new con-
struction, has been recently invented at Paris,

fomentation of vitriolic acid.

SONG,
By an old Gentleman at a Charity Sale.
Oh no I I never purchase them,
Their price 1'vo never heard,
My purso is now forbid to pay
For toys I can't afford.
Fi um booth to booth they hurry me,
'1 hat bargains I may get,
And when they win a pound from mo,
'Tis much to my regr< t.
Thev tell mo to be buying now
The gc« gawa of the day,
They hint that I should purchase trash,
But I heed not what they say.
Porhaps, like me, they never knew """"
With empty purse to frit ;
But, if they buy as I have bought,

SPACE that is more than awful—ocean, air, and land-
Stretch evermore between me, oh my love, and thee.
Our lives are far apart; and we, once hand In hand,
Have now between us rolling awful space and sea.
I cannot tell thy thoughts, I may not xee thy face ;
But dimly hear, long after, what hath been thy lot
Yet love, our love ia strong ; and thro' it's holy grace
Space shrinks away appalled, and dictanoe is forgot.

RURAL COURTSHIP.
He-Fair as the snowdrop's virgin leaf,
Or heatherbell that decks the heath.
Or lilly, when her cheeek grows red
With crimson blush by rose bud shed,
Or violet with drooping head,
So lovely is my Mary.
She-The morning sun makes nature gay;
The gushing streamlet's morning lay
Delights the flocks, as on its side
The sportire lambkins careless glide,
In thoughtless glee, in nature's pride;
So dear to me is Willy.
He-The rich in luxury may pine
And honour, wealth, their lord may tine
Ambition sigh at glory's goal
Hy heart's the needle, thoa the pole,
And oh! what bliss would fill my soul,
If thou wouldst be mine, Mary.
She-Though all that wealth could give were mine,
How dimly would each jewel shine;
Each sparkling ray would be a dart,
Would ceaseless deadly wounds impart;
If wanting thee, dear Willy!

Spidertee.
A.M. MORLEY.
Said Spider father to his son:
"" Do you as others do;
Make now a fresh home for yourself,
One big enough for two.""
So Spidertee went out one day,
And found a lovely place;
A snug bole in the ground be made,
And hung with cobweb laoe.
A door be made round as a plate
It fattened with a snap,
And if yon wished togo inside
Too always bad to tap. ' '
Said Spider father: •• If yon go
Away, ob, do take care
To olos ■ your door behind you,
And of boys with sticks beware.
"" Hera in your cupboard I trill place
Two beetles and a fly,
If you will now take my adrios
You'll make a beetle pie.""
It was a snug and pretty house,
As Spidertee well knew;
He wished his spider chains could see
The things so bright and new.
They would not oome, of course, that day.
But he could an them oall;
80 down he took his walking stiok,
And then his hat so tall.
He went to see the Bpider-girl
He was so soon tow d. - .
Alas! he found she had a cold,
And so had gone to bed.
His hat they all remarked upon, '
They liked his eyeglass, too,
But they liked best of all his coat
And little breeki of blue.
He would not stay for sapper, for
He said 'twas growing late;
Bat when he reaohed his home he found
It in a dreadful state.
The lace from off the walls was torn.
His bed lay on the floor;
The beetle pie was gone, and gone
The knocker from the door.
He did not stay to look again,
But to his mother ran,
And reusing her from sleep at onoa
To tell his woes began.
""Oh, Spidertee,"" was all she said,
"" Your door was not made fast.
And spider-robbers saw your house
fcmpty when going past.
"" I would not tell your Slimbluegee
Until it is set right,
Or she will always be afraid
If yon go ont at night.""
But Slimbluegee's gray mother heart;
Said she: ""Yon ne«d no more
Count for your bride oar SHmblaegee,
Who cannot guard your door.""
Poor Spidertee! It was too true,
And his own flimblaegee
Was married to a sptdor-boy
Who came across the sea. .
He made himself another borne, • '
And died a bachelor,
And all because when he went oat
He did not look the door. \",The Queenslander ,"805,438,263,255,490,555,615,420,515,433,594,473,544,395,504,675,515,379,516,527,607,366,516,433,526,406,633,501,702,449,575,403,496,674,512,401,708,469,557,404,557,457,677,357,615,411,571,463,494,378,588,383,561,518,587,404,589,323,466,387,641,504,637,510,556,425,480,669,702,350,572,491",Sat 2 Oct 1897,"224,369,520,3222,592,628,660,694,748,781,814,847,902,937,969,1003,1058,1091,1124,1159,1211,1246,1277,1313,1369,1402,1431,1468,1524,1557,1592,1625,1680,1713,1746,1781,1835,1869,1902,1937,1991,2024,2057,2091,2145,2180,2213,2247,2301,2334,2369,2402,2457,2491,2524,2559,2613,2647,2680,2713,2767,2803,2836,2869,2926,2957,2994,3027,3080,3117,3150,3183","2389,2639,2668,2969,2483,2543,2483,2517,2483,2515,2483,2515,2485,2518,2485,2520,2485,2517,2485,2515,2485,2517,2485,2518,2485,2518,2485,2518,2487,2518,2487,2520,2485,2521,2488,2518,2488,2520,2487,2521,2488,2521,2488,2521,2488,2521,2487,2521,2488,2521,2488,2523,2488,2523,2490,2524,2491,2524,2488,2523,2491,2524,2491,2524,2491,2521,2490,2526,2493,2526,2491,2526",24470298,Page 655

TO A NATIVE GIRL.
TUNE--""A WET SHEET AND A FLOWING SEA.""
Here's a health, my sprightly native lass,
Ten thousand healths to thee!
May joys that earths's ne'er surpass
Thy worldly portion be!
And may those liquid eyes of blue
Still in their brightness glance;
Those dewy lips of ruby's hue
No painting can enhance.
Oh! well Australia's sons may boast
Of sisters such as thou,
And quaff with bounding hearts the toast,
As fondly I do now;
For eyes like thine might light a brand
In duller hearts by far,
Than those which grace this new-found land,
'Neath Ocean's Southern star!
Sweet girl! In whatever land
It be my after-lot,
To fall 'neath Time's remorseless hand,
Thou ne'er wilt be forgot.
Thy sunny smile—thy artless face,
A beacon still shall be,
Which Time himself can ne'er efface
From my fond memory!
Then here's to thee! sweet Native Lass,
The anchor now is weighed—
The wind blows fair, and objects pass,
Alternate to the shade;
But still, as dimmer grows the shore
In the blue and sparkling sea,
My bounding heart re-echoes more,
""Here's a health, sweet maid to thee!""

Guns on our shoulders, and dogs scouring round,
Thick grows tho bush-"" Hush ! hush ! boys, bo steady,
For wo surely aro now on good 'pnssuming ground,""
Bow, wow ! goes Rory ; oil tho dogs hurry,
Barking and yelling they scamper away ;
After wo follow-bolter-skelter and scurry,
Breathless and cager to join in tho fray.

ing)
Headlong wo rush with much tearing of clothes j
Nod loses his hat, but no heed is he taking,
And smack 'gainst a gum treo goc3 poor Harry's noso.
Onward ! still onward ! tho dogs bay beforo us
""Forward ! and de'il tnko tho hindmost !"" wc cry ;
Hark ! thoro goos Willy, hoad hist in tho water,
Oan't stay a minuto to shake himself dry.

Around a big gum tree tho dogs all nro met
Eager we look.to find it no "" selling ;""
But whore is tho 'possum ? wo can't seo him yet.
Ah, is he there, to a bough closely clinging ?
Up goos a shower of loose stones and bricks.
"" Pooh ! you can't hit him ; ho's too high for flinging ;
Tako up your guns, boys, and lire like bricks.""
Tom takes tho first shot to show us his powers- *
""Missed him! Now, Harry, mind you bring him
down.

Give mo the gun, and I'll soon crack his crown. ""
"" Missed ! Botheration ! How, Ned, you aro laughing,

You're quito sure you hit him, and don't mind our
chaffing ;
Then, Will, take the gun-put him out of his pain.""
"" No !"" Wo all fire at once, liko a small peal of thunder,
Down como sticks mid bark ; sure he must descend.
No, by tho powers ! Wo stand speechless with wonder ;
"" Give up the shooting,-let's climb to our friend.""
"" Tom, you're a climber ; think you, you can do it ?""
"" 'Tis a ditficult tree."" "" Yes; wo knew that right well.
But pray, don't give up, boys, or else-bad luck to it

And down ho came tumbling, near killing Will's pup.

I wish 'possum hunting had ne'er been inventod ;
I'll try it no more-let it go to the deuce.""
Next Harry essays it, but vain is his trying,
He but skins his fingers, his knees, and his nose ;
Then clown he comos flop, and sits grumbling and
sighing, -
Counting tho holes ho has torn in his clothes.
"" Well, light a big fire, and at any rato plainly
We'll soo tho old varmint and shoot at him straight j
Don't lot us waste precious moments so vainly

"" Who's got a match, hero ? Como, don't bo delaying,
There's no timo to waste, for it's nearly ono now.
Ned, Tom, or Harry? Whoro's Willy now staying,
A smoker like ho carries matches I trow ?""
Yes, Will has sonic matches, and hails tho words
gladly,
Pulls out a wet mass-oh, dear, ho forgot ;
Tho matches are spoiled, Willy shakes his head sadly ;
When ho foll in tho wator ho ruined the .'ot.
No matches wero thcro, so ho next tried the firing
Of powder and paper in piles of dead leaves ;
But tho only result was of patience tho tiring,
Tho fuel was damp, and no blaze ho achioves.
Again and again, wo shoot him-'twas shocking
But still ho clings fast just beneath a big bough,
With his ugly groat tail sticking out as if mocking ;
Wo felt ho was chuckling in scorn at us now.
At last 'twas so late that wo thought of returning
All torn, bruised, ¡iud bleeding, with divers mishaps ;
Wc sneaked [into bed, all sympathy spurning
I At breakfast next morning what chop-fallen chaps.
Hal's nose was just Uko a hugo beotroot, Will groaning
I About a sore throat, not a morsel could cat ;
I Ned's face was all scratches, and Tom kept on moaning,
He'd got a big thorn in ono of his feet.
Nod and Harry went out after broa'<fast in tryiug
I To find out the sceno of our last night's defeat,
1 Declaring to seo that old cuss dead or dying,
Stretched out on the ground, would bo such a treat.
At dinner when scated, homo carno Ned and Harry,
They'd wandered for hours beforo finding the treo ;
And when at last found they'd a long time to tarry,
To laugh at thc sight that they there carno to soe.
Wo cried, ""Whoro's tho 'possum?"" "" Wo guess ho is
hanging
Stone dead by his tail"" (we've heard of that trick).

(Over this road running west through the Gar-
dens to the Children's Hospital Melbourne mothers
carry their children day by day.)
This is the road the fainting go on Summers
keen and bold.
And this the way of the wounded in bitterness
and cold.
Oh, some are proud in the loving arms, and
some too faint to sigh.
I am with God in a reverence when Mother
Love goes by.
They tell me that the city dust has filled the
trees with grime,
And the flowers are pale-I will not have such
heresy in my rhyme!
For the rainy eyes of the children have left
them sweet and fair--
There is no stain on the clean gardens when
Mother Love is there.
They tell me that this wide city is black with
every sin,
And that heaven's gates are shut so fast we
never may crowd in.
But the woes of little eyelids will teach us
how to pray,
And our eyes will all go mothering wich
Mother Love to-day.
Vainly I seek the scented word, the witness
of the Spring,
Glad with the honey at the heart for long
remembering,
But dumb I am to the clean earth and dumb
to the great sky--
I am with God in a reverence when Mother
Love goes by.

HORÆ CATNACHIAÆ.
Under this funny and fantasticle title a
very capital article haa been furnished in
Fraser's Magazine : the insight which it affords
into the penetralia of low life is extremely en-
tertaining and not a little instructive. What
a strange affair is human nature, and especially
the human nature of low or vulgar life ! We
have been so much amused ourselves with
some of the Catnach-es, that we feel desirous
to impart some portion at least of our enter-
tainment to our numerous and kind readers.
We should, however, premise, that Mr.
Catnach was, to a grat extent, printer and pub-
lisher of sundry poetical effusions, commonly
called street-ballads, and that this worthy pa-
tron of the muses lived either in Seven Dials,
Spitalfields, or some equally out-of-the-way
place, and has since retired on a comfortable
independence. From whom Mr Catnach pro-
cured his "" POETRY;"" we have no means of
ascertaining, but certainly the specimens
which the writer in Fraser has produced, are
extremely clever, rich, and racy.
The first we shall refer to, is a most dismal
and deporable "" Lament,"" from a young, lady,
named Sarah Collins, which Lament compri-
ses a very awful description of Van Diemen's
Land, in reference to the ill and cruel treat-
ment of those most interesting of "" woman-
kind,""—the assigned female servants. Among
other lamentations, Miss Collins thus delivers
herself:
"" They chain us two by two, and whip and lash
along,
They cut off our provisions, if we do the least thing
wrong,
They march us in the burning sun, until our feet are
sore.
So hard's our lot now we are got upon Van Diemen's
shore.
We labour hard from morn to night, until our bones
do ache,
Then every one, they must obey, their mouldy beds
must make ;
We often wish, when we lay down, we ne'er may rise
no more.
To meet our savage governors upon Van Diemen's
shore.
Every night when I lay down, I wash my straw with
tears,
While wind upon that horrid shore do whistle in our
ears;
Those dreadful beasts upon that land around our cots
do roar ;
Most dismal is our doom upon Van Diemen's shore.
Come all young men and maidens, do bad company
forsake,
If tongue can tell our overthrow, it would make your
heart to ache;
You girls, I pray, be ruled by me, your wicked ways
give o'er.
For fear, like us, you spend your days upon Van
Diemen's shore.""
Whatever may have been the exaggerating
bias of Miss Collin's sprightly imagination,
we give her every credit for the sage and sa-
lutary caution and advice, which is contained
in the last verse of the portion we have quoted.
We are quite sure, that if "" you girls be ruled
by me,"" that is, by Miss Collins, we should not
be tormented quite so much by "" you girls,""
as we are at present ; but we fear that our
hope for such a blessed consummation, is a
very forlorn one.
The best ballad in the bunch is the one en-
titled "" The Pleasing Wife and Satisfied Hus-
band."" It certainly lacks the stern solemnity
and gloomy misanthropism of a Byron-the
chivalrous and picturesque energy of a Scott
the playful melody of a Moore-the conceited
Lakeisms of a Southey, a CoU ridge, and a
Wordsworth-to say nothing of the puling af-
fectations of a Leigh Hunt, and a Johnny Keats
&c. Sec. fee.-but it does possess a genuine,
most original, and most excellent humour,
than which "" none but itself can be its parallel.""
We give it, therefore, at full length, unshorn
of any of its bright beams, and untouched by
tbe cruel hand of criticism :- ,
"" The Pleating Wife and Saiitfied Husband.
"" You married people, Indi and low, come listen to
my song,
I'll shew to j ou economy, and not detain you long;
In ?? lived a tradesman who wished to see things
right,
And to account last Monday morn he called his
loving wife.
Chorus.
Who quickly told lum in a crack which way the
money goes.
When to his wife lie tailed account, as you may well
suppose,
My dear, says he, come tell me how and where mv
money goes ?
Every week I give you one pound one, we have but
children three.
And for my wages every week I very little see.
Well, now says she, if you must know, you shall with
good intent ;
Now first we pay a half-a-erown.cveiy week for rent,
'1 liree-and-sixpence every week (or bread, «ind for
butter, suuar, au I tea
Two and twopence J>>ay out as yon may plainly see.
There is tenpence eveiy week for coals, and sixpence
wood and coke,
Threepence needles, pins, and thread, and sixpence
ha'penny soap,
Three and sixpence every week for meat, three shil-
lings potatoes and greens^ ' '
And then there's threepence halfpenny, every wtek
for milk or cream.
VA eil, now say«: he, we'll reckon up which way the
M, money's gone, ,, a '
Seventeen and just tjiree-halfpence, where's the test
of one pound one ;
There's three and ninepenre-halfpenny left as yon
' perhaps wa'I knows, ° '""t '
So pray inform me where the rest'of my week's waget
goesî ; iii ¡
Every morning for youi breakfast I for you must
something make, * ' ' ' / '
And once or twice a-week 'you know you have a
pound of steak ; . '
That will average one and sixpence more, but that is
not enough, i"" <
You have ninepence for tobacco, and threepence
ha'-'penny for snuff. ,?? ; ,
Well, that's just two and eightpence more, and if you
do your'best, l < ^ ^ ii < > * ""
It will puzzle yW to tell me how and where goes all
! the1 rest, : . r
Nineteen and fivepence-halfpenny I just<reckon up
that's gone, , ,
Then there's one and sixpence-halfpenny remains ol'
one pound one.
Says she yon take me very close, you must.confest
you do,
There's threepence halfpenny every week for soda,
starch, and blue,
A pint of beer T fetch you every day, you see which
way its gone, ' « i
Now reckon up and seewhat'S left, out of your one
pound one. ' ' it,,
Twenty shil lingi« ant* elevenpence is tbe exact amount,
Well now, says she, since you have called me to a
strict account, ¡ -<
There's just one single penny left out of your on«
pound one, < i (
So where dues matches, candles, and all other things
come from I ( , -
Well now, says he, I'm satisfied, your'e right and I'm
content, ' ,'>,,,
But 1 could not imagine how and where the money
went; r
Scarce one man out of fifty the house expenses knows,
But I at last am satisfied which way the money goes.""
This, of its kind, is undoubtedly'the raoBt
exquisite morceau which has ever fallen under
our notjce, and we really think that the moral
which it conveys, is worthy of the most atten-
tive consideration ; the care and kindness of
the wife forming a prominent feature, on the
one side, and the vigilance and exactitude df
the husband on the other. See, also, how far
"" one pound one"" may be made to go, not-
withstanding the somewhat awkward interpo-
sition of the "" children three.""
One more snatch, and we have done. This
relates to Rêverai characters :-To a Police-
man-an Old Woman "" who lived in Green-
wich-town,"" and who, dressed in a soldier's
jacket, drank gin by pailsful-and "" though
last not least,"" to His Grace the Duke of
Wellington, who, the Bard states, lost one
fine morning, "" twelve inches of his nose,"" to
the lively tune of "" tit fal la ra whack Ï"" We
have room, however, only in our present num-
ber, for the Police-man, and the Soldier
woman, to each of whom we can devote but a
couple of stanzas :
"" A policeman, L-, letter K, 249,
In the Mile End road, good iack-a-day, has play'J
some tricks so fine; '
While the butcher for a moment from his Window
turn'd his back, i
The policeman collar'd a piece of beef, like tit fal Ja
w ra whack. >., ,
i'he butcher saw him take the beef, which grieved him
full sore,
So without any more to do he kick'd him from the
door; ,.
1 hey took his trousers, coat, and boots, and order'd
him the sack,
So the commmissioner depriv'd him of his tat fal la
ra whack.
"" AD old woman lived in Greenwich-town, that wore
a soldier's coat,
And to swallow gin she long'd to have the railroads
in her throat ;
As she was coming from Horn Fair, she thought to
have a lark
Sie swallow'd twenty wooden legs, and bolted Green
> wich Park. s *
So to coucfude my ditty, and for to make an end,
They say we shall no taxes pay, then off we'll quickly
send
The rogues that did for taxes call to the^d-- in a
pack ; . ' .>
They may take their books and toddle off, like tit fal
la ra whack."" j *
We may, perhaps, return to this most amu-
sing article, if we find our own opinion re-

MAN, drawing to Iiis latest end
(Beyond the dimly darkening room),
Beholds, afar, each ancient friend,
With pitying looks of anxious gloom.
Astes to ashes ! Dust to dust !
He knows the fateful fiat's come,
Which weans him from each worldly lust¡
With welcome to his unknown home !
«The "" li ttl o soul"" that gave lifo strength,
The ""feohle soul"" wliioh lifo upbore,
And dragged him through existence' length,
He feels grow feebler, moro and more.
With fainter, faintest, fainting breath j ,j'
He feels tho solid globe around
Dissolving, as he sinks in death
And darkness-silent and profound !
The deepest depth of unknown space,
Whore worn-out planets lonely sink
And crumbl?, ns their burnt-out race Q
Descend beneath Creation's brink,
Is not more awful to each star H
Than death is to the par ting,soul,
Which sees Eternity afar, . j
Yet dies - unoertain of life's goal ! . ;
Do fiends come muttering round oar biar ?
Or angels whisper ? as they fold
Their wings of light around tho dear
Departed ono--so calm !-so cold !
Chilling as rmrble to the finger !- .
Tender as flesh ! where'love's last kiss
Across the quiet, sealed lips linger,
Whilst praying for its future bliss.

However humble on this Earth,

So mortal lives - though Heavonly formed
FUI varying forms by Nature's laws

Moulds it or mutilates, or blind ' ' |

TO MORROW.
lîy Mr. Blackman, at 'his Rooms, Hunter^
slreet, at l-l o'clodk-Boltled-Ale,- Porter,'
und Silver Watches.
By «Foss and 'Lloyd, at the Callie Market, al
12 o'clock-Mares, Geldings, &c.
State of tue Country.-The last news
received from tliP several country districts has
no1 in general been of such a favorable descrip-
tion's wo could have wbhed. In the neigh-
bourhood of tho Lower Hawkesbury they have
had a succession of ruins «hieb Listed about
light days, which, of course, is expected to be
very prejudicial to the great quantity of whea't,
both reaped and unreaped, at present on
ibu ground. -In some purls lite wheat has
commenced io grow. The tobacco plants have
suffered to a great extent, 'I he ircsws from
otherp&rts of the country slate that they are
not in suth a bad stale.
Shocking Accident.-On Sunday afternoon
an accident, as melancholy-as any it has ever
been-our painful duty to record, happened near
K»sex-Iaiic. The body of a young child of
20 mouths old, whose name wo have not been
able to ascertain, was-found drowned that after-
noon in a cavity of the rocks which is only
filled willi water in rainy weather. It appeared
that the child's mellier had gone to sleep in the
afternoon, being fatigued by the heal of the
day : dilling which time the child bad in walk-,
ing about fallen bead foietnost into the pool
When The body was discovered life was extinct.
The medical geniLman called gave his opinion
that the child must have been uu hour in the
water.
Mounted Policemen shot.-It was rumoured
through Sydney, yesterday, that two of the
mounted police had been shot by the bushrangers
on the Hunter a few days ago. Thirty of thal
body were despatched last week to exterminate,
or if possible to bring those mauruders to jus-
tice.
Police Oouut.-This court was crowded to
suffocation yesterday, both by visitors theie by
their own consent, and those (here nolens vol na.
No person who left the fresh air would ever
dream of-envying the situation of a Police
Magistrate; the air was absolutely so thick
and rank, dial, in Yankee phrase, one might
almost have cut it with a razor. The drunken
list wag very prolific, and a few other good
cases were brought on.
The Press.-The press of Australia has
lately received two additions in the Geelong
Advertiser and the Perth Gazette. It is now
about lo receive another in the Maitland Ex
. ¡»'ess, and Hunter's River Advertiser. We
wish our new cotemporay that success which
we have no doubt he will merit.
Shocking Assault.-On Christmas night
last, between the hours of nine and len o'clock,
a disturbance took place among a set of drunken
fellows in Essex-street, when it was found ne-
cessary that the constabulary should interfere.
One of (he cons'abuliiry, named M'Grath,- laid
hold of a man who was engaged in the row,
when some person struck bim a severe blow on
the temple which fractured his skull. M'Grath
immediately fell, and was afterwards carried tu
the shop of Dr. M'Kellar, and from thence to
the Hospital, where he now is in a very dan-
gerous state ; indeed, we have been informed
that there is little or no chance of his recovery.
It has not as yet been ascertained who struck
ihe blow.
The Weather.-The weather in and about
Sydney has for the last three or four days been
very delightful, which is very fortunate, con-
sidering the festive season, ami the necessity of
such weather for the ripening of the crops.
Christmas.-This holiday was conducted
with great propriety in Sydney. The streets
displayed the u.-ual number of well dressed per
sons, some going lo church and others on
pleasure excursions. We are, however, gorry
to say that there were a great number of drunken
persons on the street during the evening.
The Constabulary.-These functionaries
paraded the streets on Christmas day in their
new costume, which decidedly is an improve-
ment on the old. That of the water police is
decidedly handsome. We hope that this body
of men will renovate their conduct as well as
their dresses; Heaven knows it much requires it.
The Markets.-The markets, with tho ex-
ception of a few articles, remain firm to their
former prices. Vegetables, we are glad to say,
are much lower, but the staff of life has under-
gone no change.
SuPitEMB Court-The first of January next,
which commences the year 1841, is the first day
of the first quarter of the criminal sittings of the
Supreme Court. We have heard that the list
this session is a very full one. There are three
or four cases for rape lo bo tried; the culprits
for this offence are mostly old men.
r We are requested by Messrs. A. & S. Lyons, I
to contradict a paragraph which appeared in
the Sydney M-oni'or of Friday last, «fating
they had become the purchasers of the schooner
1 Truelove, tiley being agents only to that vessel.
CRICKET MATCH. - A cricket match will
take place on New Year's Day, between the
Australian and Victoria Cricket Clubs. This
match is expected to be strongly contested -
We could not conceive a more appropriate day
for such an amusement. The grounds we ex-
pect will be crowded, and we hope that the
sight of this manly and athletic game will in-
duce many of the young men who are specta-
tors to become members of one or other of
the clubs. We know of no game so conducive
to health.
A Candid Witness.-Yes'enlay a woman
named Muiy Evans wits brought to the bar in
ho Police Court, charged by a mau named
Connolly, who lodged willi lier, wi.h liaviug
stolen a pound note from bim on Saturday
night last. Mr. G. R, Nichols appeared for
the defence. When the witness appeared in the
b 'x he was asked by Mr. Nichols if he.lodged
with the prisoner, when he-answered something
in it low voice.
Mr. Nichols-SpeaTi out bir ; did yon lodge
with the prisoner 3
Witness-(bawling to the full extent of his
lungs) ; to he sure I did.
Captain Innes-To be sure I'd send yon to
the watch-house, if you do not behave in a
proper manner.
Mr. Nichols-Have yon been drinking this
morning?
Connolly-(cooly)-Yes, I have. Mr. Ni-
chols-And pray what did you drink? Cou.
nolly-Why, lot'me see ; I bad two bottles of
ginger beer, and two nobblers of b, andy. Mr.
Nichols - Well, that's very fair before eleven
o'clock ; pray, Connolly, were you drunk last
night ? Connolly-Yes, I was. (Laughter in
the court.) Mr. Nichols-ï thought so! and
wero you drunk the night before thal? Con-
nolly -I was, that «aUhe night of the robbery.
Captain Innes-That will do ! Mary Evans,
you are discharged. And off Mary walked,
her countenance beaming with virtuous indig-
nation.
Teetotaler*.--Yesterday, a meeting and
procession of this numerous body took place.
It was attended by an ¡inmensa multitude. Al-
though no admirers of processions, the nature of
this society and its praisewoi thy object, must
?make it an exception in the minds of all.
Tun Market.-Mr. S. B. 'Curtis has ic
ceived the appointmeulof Cb rk of the Market.
His Excellency the Governor outjht to give
ordets to have that street made passable leading
down to ihe Village of Double Bay; a serious
accident happened the other day, and many
more which naver reach Sydney. We trust
the numerous residents in lhat quarter will have
this indispensable request granted.
The Rev. Mr. Davy has arrived in the Cuba,
to replace the Itev. Air. Churton, who proceeds
to the Buy of Islands. The Rev. Mr. Davy
being a candidate for orders, is not yet compé-
tent to fulfil all the duties.of his sacred office.
Weare informed that Captain Williams, of
the schooner Jane, has luid down the keel of a
vessel-of uboui 25 tons, which he expects lo be
afloat in four months. When finished she is
intended for the trade of this port ; andas
her owner served seven years willi Curling,
Cox, and Co., the great ship builders of Roth
erhilhe, we expect lo see a clipper, and con-
gratulate him aceoi dingly.
Shooting.-On the first of the ensuing year
(Friday first) a purse of fifty guineas will be
shot for, by twenty members of the old shooting
ground.
Return -of H. M. S. Beagle -We extract
the retum of this vessel from a copy of the
Perth Gazette,, of the middle of October. ""This
surveying vessel returned to our port on the 28th
ultimo, she anchored under Rottnest Island on
tho 27th, and removed into Gage's Roads on
the 28th. Nothing of importance connected
with the survey of the New South Wales coast
has trabspired, further than that the survey on
the north and north west coast of New Holland
is now completed. The Beagle visited Timor,
but brings no later intelligence from the east ;
and no account of the fate of the Pelorus, which
vessel, it may be remembered, was driven on
shore at Port Essington. She also touched at
Sharks' Bay, where an ample supply of turtle
was obtained, at the intervening islands. Op-
posite Morseby's flat-topped range a good an-
chorage or harbour was discovered, but open to the north-west.""
Dinner to Glengarry.-Tt is with great
pleasure that we hear that a dinner to the
Chieftain of Glengarry will -sliorlfy come off.
Ii is to be conducted on a most magnificent scale,
and it is supposed will be the most splendid
uff.iir of tho kind which haj ever taken place
in Sydney. We'bave not as yet heard where
it is'to take place, nor what will be the charge
of the ticket for admission.
Robbery. On Friday Ia*t, while Mr. G.
Bennet, boot and shoo maker, George-street;
was absent at church, some person or persons
entered the shop and stole from I hence the
following articles, viz. : A Check on the Bank
of New South Wales, dated the 28th Decem-
ber, for £G5, drawn by Mr. Wyatt in favour of
Mr. Bennet. £2 8s. GJ. in cash ; 9 pairs of
Wellington boots, 8 pairs of Clarence boots,
and other articles. Mr. Bennet on discovering
his loss, posted in several parts of the town,
plackards, offering a reward of £5 for the apprt
hension of the party or parties. We have been
informed, that two or three persons were appre-
hended on Saturday night on suspicion of the
robbery.
Theatre -A riot took place in the Victoria
Theatre, on Saturday night, and was only
quelled aftei thirty-five of the parties had been
taken to tile watch-house. Sarve 'em right !
Geelong.-Our latest papers received from
Geelong are of the most uninteresting nature.
As"" regard news ihey seem to be much in the
same predicament with ourselves. We subjoin
the following trifles from our latest date.
GALLAGHER THE AUSTRALIAN POET.--We
have been favored by Mr. Lyle, Superintendent
of the House of Correction, with the following
lines, addressed to him by the above worthy
during his last visit to the treadmill, where he
has often been recommended by the Bench for
the benefit of his health. We lay the lines
before our readers, as they have at least the
merit of originality:--
My fate condimns me for tbe want of shoes,
A sad complaint that oft attends the muse;
And if that there be any for to spare,
Could I solicit or expect a pair?
For I from Sydney do intend to steer,
And cease from paying further visits here.
The roads are bad, and I can scarcely stand,
Or walk barefooted on the stones or sand;
To ask this favour I am further led,
As you have done a kindness to my head;
That other parts an equal share may meet,
I hope that you will not forget my feet:
And us I travel o'er each weary mile,
I will look back and pray for Mr. Lyle.
Oct. 31st, 1840. W. GALLAGHER.
News.-The Colonial news is very dull at
present, at this time of the year-such is inva-
riably the case. The Courts being all >hut, and
nothing of public importance tran-acling. We
are, therefore, necessitated'lo make up our news
of such extraéis from linglish and other jour
nais, U9 wo think most interesting.
Sale of Land. - Oh Thursday last was held
the land sale by Mr. Forster, which bad been
adjourned from the previous week. The sale
vrus well attended, and the land, which con-
sisted of three half avros in South Geelong,
went off at fair prices. One allotment at the
corner of Yarra and Fyans-st'reet, sevcntv-fve
feet routage anti sixty five deep, fetched £2 5-,
per (bot. The following is au abstract of the
result ol' the sale : -
Allotment Ii of Block 6. £460 0 0
Allotments 8 k 4 same block . . . . 365 9 0
Total. £830 0 0
Tns Blacks.-The outrages committed b^
these innocent children of nature are so fre-
quent that the scttleis are "" getting used to
them."" A tribe of blacks, las week, drove
sewulven sheep from Mr. Murston's station on
the Grampians, and had not the shepherds
shown a determined spirit, furlhir outrages
would have ensued.
Orders.-The order nuisance is at its fall
height in G. elong at prscut ; most of-our
money transactions are settled by orders of the
Melbourne bunks, which is exceedingly incon-
venient, and causes un apparent scarcity of
money when no such scarcity exists. The evil
¡3 increased by the fact, that if a twenty-pounds
order be tendered iu payment of a ten pound
debt, the balance is expected to be banded over
' in hard cash ! The establishment of a branch
bank cannot be delayed much longer.
1 The Constables' Nzw Stafi's.-The new
1 Bluffs which ibu Sydney constables received on
' Christmas day aro much shorter than those
' lately worn by that body. We beard two men
' talking on ihe t-ubject on Saiurday last, when
. one of them remarked, in the course of conver-
sation, that the new ones would give as hard a
blow, and be more difficult to be wrenched from
the hand than the other ones. "" Ob.lhroth !""
replied his neighbour, ""an ¡isthemselves can
give a hard blow sure enough, but by the powers
if I only had a good shiiielah in my hand, I'd
give two blows will) one twist of my fist. Och,
the shiiielah (hat can woik at boll) ends is ihe
thing for an Irishman!""
Musquitoes.-These nuisances are among
tho greatest plagues which at present infest
Sydney. Wo never knew them so numerous
ai they are at this pri scut season of the year.
The inhabitants in general, anti new comers in
particular, should subscribe together a handsome

We prayed for cloudy, m«5onles6 nights and
then for morning suns.
""Twfts on a morning gray we saw a cruiser

Two sisters, waving' handkerchiefs broke down
and laughed, and cried.
And after that we didn't carp how dark the

Our hearts were warm with love and pride; we
were ashamed to think

At last he came to church to-day;
Six neighbors carried him that way;
But, when he passed the portals
straight,
Another had to swing the gate,
Another open wide the door,
For he could open it no more.
But now at last he came in search
Of something that they have in
church.
The preacher spoke a helpful word,
And yet I wonder if he heard,
Or, if he heard, he understood?
His hearing now was not so good.
He was made welcome, for all men
Are always welcome, even then;
And yet he would have been, I know,
As welcome years and years ago.
We all must go to church some day,
But some of us too long delay.
The words of comfort by our bier
We could have come in life to hear,
For here to greet us waits a Friend
At the beginning, not the end.

MINISTERIAL CHORUS--""NOTICE TO QUIT.""
""Notice to quit!""--""Notice to quit!""
Look on the walls what words are writ!
Up in the gallery--down on the floor,
Plainer than ever they showed before.
""Come down from your places"" the letters shine;
""Ye are weighed--ye are wanting--Resign, resign.""
In the people's eyes, upon every face
Glooms the dark shadow of our disgrace,
And the voice of a nation in angry roar
Wakes up like the sea on its fretted shore;
And the tempest thickens--outside--outside--
On the fury of winds our goblins ride;
In ominous hubbub they come--they grow--
Nearer--above us--around--below--
On yonder benches their figures seem
To muster like shapes of some hideous dream,
And lend to the conflict a fearful might,
Like gods that mingle in mortal fight.
Hotter and hotter does MARTIN wax,
Bruising our bones with his battle-axe;
Taller and taller does ARNOLD loom,
Shrivelling our flesh with his wild simoom;
And MURRAY the driver, with ox-goad fierce,
Plays at his terrible carte and tierce;
And COWPER pinches us black and blue,
And PIDDINGTON tightens his timber screw;
And over the table BOB CAMPBELL scowls,
And ROBERTSON blusters, and FORSTER growls,
And DALLEY scourges with lash polite,
And the RUSDENS help him with bark and bite,
And JONES the traitor--the cruel JONES
Taunts us for ever in bitterest tones,
Shifting about--to no party tied,
But he always hits hardest against our side.
How little for sawder he seems to care;
What a deal of that article's wasted there!
And NICHOLS is basely falling away,
And EGAN won't wink at the game we play,
And OXLEY has notions of independence,
And our friends have grown noted for slack attendance.
For ever, for ever the tumult swells--
We stand as a target for shots and shells.
Say, then, shall we yield to the warning voice,
And withdraw while withdrawal is left to choice?
For willing or not we must hence away,
The destinies order us not to stay.
There, on the walls is their sentence writ--

Continually paragraphe appear in the papers '
stating that the water from some artesian bore
ja running io waste. A case in point is a report
from Moree, stating that the overflow from Dol
gelly Bore has caused a swamp on the public
road which had "" rendered heavy traille imipas
eable. Thousands of pounds of public money has
been spent in sinking artesian welle, with the
extraordinary result-that people complain of the
nuisance arising from too much water. Either
artesia-n water is a benefit to the ccnumunity in
which tho well is. situated or it is not. If it is
an advantage, the people who benefit should be
compelled to see that it is not wasted. If the Svell
was sunk for no other purpose than to demon
strate the presence of water in any given locality, .
and: tho water; is not used hy the conumunity,
then the well should be capped and, locked until
tho water is required. Probably the wells ought
to be .'capped any way, and no more water al
lowed to flow from them than is absolutely neces
sary to supply local ""wants. In some portions, of
America.a municipal ordnance demands that every
artesian well shall be furnished with a cap and 1
a lock, and no water permitted to run to waste,
under a penalty. We have heard much ci irri
gation problems in this, colony, and large sums
of money hare been spent on surveys and draw
ings outlining proposed, canals from ?"".intermittent
rivers, which under ordinary conditions could never,
bo made to pay. But in the case oí artesian wells,
where the watea* is suitable, the case is different,
for they supply* water in dry seasons as well as
in wet ones. Why, then, in the nairne of common
sense, cannot Irrigation settlements be started- in
con nection with these wells? As a'matter of fact,
it would seem as if nobody in the colony wanted
bo. irrigate. If there was really any demand by
bona-fide settlers for irrigable land, the areas now
lying idle around our artesian wells would be
eagerly ""selected for that purpose, and apparent
ly; if the sinking of many of these wells had been
left to private entemprise, the public woiuld have

A. very pretty story tinder the title ""A Romance
ot the Peerage"" has heen going the rounds o£ the
Australian press. It is, briefly, to the effect that
a Mr. R. D. J. Fitzgerald, who has lately been em- ,
ployed as a gardener at Adelaide, has been in
fornied by .cable-that'an uncle who has just died
had left him a legacy of £300 a year, and also that
ho was ""heir-presumptive to the Barony, of De
Ros."" Other interesting information as to the
past career of the future peer is also given. Ac- '
custonied as Australians are to finí scions of the.
British aristocracy acting as roustabouts or loafing
in the Domain, there appears to be hut slight
foundation for the. latest story. The Barony of De
Ros, or De.Roos, as it was originally styled, is the
premier barony of England. It descends- from
Robert de Roos, a.grandson of another Robert,, who
was one of the twenity-flve barons ,who extorted
Mágna Charta from King John, and who was sum
moned to Parliament in 1264. v The barony was in
aheyance from the death, in 1687, of the profligate
Duke of Buckingham, until 1806v when it was»ter
minated in favor of Charlotte, daughter bf the Hon.
Rohert Boyle-""Walsingham, wife of Lord' Henry
FitzGerald, and grandmother of the present peer.
The Barony of D'? Ros descends to heirs general,
and the present ielr-apparent is the Hon. Mary
Francés, his only daughter, bongin 1854, and mar
ried in 1878 to the Hon. A. Ii. Dawson, son of the
Earl of j Dartrey. As there is issue of this mar
riage three daughters,, the. probability of the Ade
laide claimant succeeding to the title is somewhat
reinóte.
One half the world doen't know how the other
half travels. The writer has beer* led into this
philosophical reflection by that-item ef hews
flashed aerees the ocean the other day, that 400
emigrants had been poisoned on an Italian steamer
by verdigris from the cooking, utensils mixing
with the food. The way of the emigrant hos ever
been a hard, one, and it ts to be presumed will
always remain so while necessity compels people
of slender means to cross the ocean. - It makes
little difference, toe, whether the ship be Italian or
whether it be British. On some British ships
indeed emigrants, or what is much the same thing,
steerage passengers, fare worse than on many car
rying the ..flags of other nationalities. A few.
weeks ago a friend'of the writer's finding that
thing» were not going too well with him in Austra
lia, decided to return home. He was busy packing
when I called to say goodbye. Piled up on the
table were packets of ;tea and sugar, jars"" of jam,:
tins of condensed milk, sardines, preserved meats,
biscuits, essences, with ""a téa-pot and a host of
other little things. ""What are you going to do
with these?"" I asked. MWby, put them in my
trunk, of course."" VI thought the steamer found
you in everything?"" ""So it does in a sense if
you. care to take what's going;: but, you see, I am
profiting by the experience I gained on my voyage
out. ""A man never leaves himself dependent sole
ly on the ship's hospitality twice in succession.
There's no lack-of food you know-of a sort-but
it's plain, very plain, and almost invariably spoil
ed in the cooking. You see those little boxes
there, those ai-e pills, very useful things to a
steerage passenger."" ""You have surely enough
of them?"" I ventured. ""I think so. I hope so.
It's this way. We'll have sea-pie once a week,
and plain pudding twice a week. Sea-pie seldom
takes less than fifteen pills to dislodge it, hut in
the pudding the presence of the fruit stalks: re
duces the consistency somewhat, and ten pills
usually suffice. Twice ten plus fifteen and you
have 35, or about a box per week."" ""And these
things here?- You don't mean to say you re
quire them oh board?"" ""What! not insect pow
der? Not carbolic? Not candle?.Not pastiles?
My good fellow it is easily seen-hut I forget you
have never travelled 'tween decks. Pray Heaven
that n you never may."" I really pitied- my poor
friend. At the same time I could not but admire
his cheerfulness and his pluck.""' - The way of the
emigrant is Indeed a hard one.

An English, visitor, with something of insular
contempt for ""our institutions,"" told me the other
day that he miûlîked our system of Government
railways and tramways. It deprived us, he said
of the maAy benefits duo to competition. So I
carefully pointed out to him that the Ocean-street
cable tram had, by the purest competition, thrown
out of use a whole branch of the steam tram; ¿nd
that the new line about to be laid in Geórge-street
would compete severely, if not ruinously, with
the city sectioin of the older trams. . And h'e an
swered that these were the defects not the ad
vantages of competition! ' Which shows how use
less it is to< aigue against invincible prejudice.
Also, he ""wanted to know, you know,"" why the
existing' tramways stop short of Circular Quay,
losing meet of' the North Shore and Manly passen
gers to the omnibuses; and why there are no
penny fares ""between street-ends"" in the city. It
would have been impossible to explain all this
satisfactorily to a man of that kind, and I thought
it beet to change the eubject.

It requires' considerable courage in these highly
educated days, even on the part of, a Governor, to
confess to a total ignorance of music. Yet even
here the law of compensation helps to . bring the
balance even. The man who, as Chancellor Mac
Laurin scornfully quotes, ""is not moved with con
cord of sweet sounds,"" also escapes the agony
which is suffered by the sensitive ear under the
infliction of ""harsh discords ' and unpleasant
j sharps."" He does not dream of the homicidal im
'pulse ""which seizes upon the mildest of men under
the prolonged torture of, his neighbor's ill-used
j piano, or the shrill vocal gymnastics of his neigh
bor's accomplished daughter. He is blissfully un
conscious of the shriek that ""pierces the fearful
hollow"" of the musician's ear, the exasperating re
iteration of the same, passage with the ever-recur
rent false notes, the ""sweet bells jangled out of
tune,"" and all the harmonies gone mad which rack
the victim's quivering nerves-of all these, he reeks
nothing. No, in these days of thin walla and cheap
pianos, of incompetent teachers1 and ambitious stu
dents, happy is the man who has ""no ¿ar,"" and who
humbly but cheerfully admits that he ""doesn't
know one note of music from another.'

A device for obtaining from.common air a gas t
that will burn for lighting and heating purposes,
""by--.neutraiising the incombustible constituents,""
is, if anything, a shade more startling than the
Laputon project for extracting sunlight from cu
cumbers. For cucumbers do contain sunlight, in
a sense, but the air has never been credited with
containing fuel. Nitrogen won't burn, and oxygen,
though necessary to all burning, won't burn either;
and aa for the newly-discovered argon, it is as fire
proof a brickbat. So, but for the assurance
that the thing has been successfully tried in Syd
ney, one would be inclined to say that the air ""has
bubbles,, as the water 'hath, and this is of them,""

gold from cabbage stumps, and the brewing of good
ale out of paving stones1, may he performed with

Professor Gosman, now visiting . Sydney, ls an
advócale of the fixing a ""minimum wage,"" as prac
tised in'Victoria. With most adrâirablo frank
ness ho admits that fixing a minimum wage does
not secure its being paid, ""because it cannot be,
unless there ls the work;"" but he considers it valu
able as a standard, and for its educative effect.
If it is thus intended only as a ""counsel of per
fection,"" there can be'no"" harnTin putting it pretty
high. A good big minimum wage in each trade
would form an interesting Item In the information
circulated for the use of emigrants, and would
, tend to attract an energetic and ambitious class
of men. And it would be little, if at all, more
delusive than some of the statements as to wages
and priées to be found in documents of tho kind.
The writer of this note is entirely in sympathy
with Professor Gosman's idea, and means to ""ant
upon it by suggesting to the editor that he he re
munerated at a minimum rate of five guineas a
.line. If it is explained that this amount need

With tho landing in-Sydney last week, of tho
contingent of Pennanent Artilleryman and Sub
marine Miners was witnessed the return of tho
last of those of our troops who participated in
the glory, pomp, and circumstance of the Record
Reign celebrations. They followed hard upon
the heels of the Mounted Rifles. Both the latter
and thé Lancers, who had come back some week*,
before, had got the heartiest of receptions from
the public, as well as from their comrades-in
.arms. And, as if to show that neither civilians
nor military were getting tired of offering thsee
demonstrations, the enthusiasm of the ""welcome
home, boys!"" was not a whit less pronounced
for the Artillerymen and Miners than for the
troops that had come fresh from their Jubileo
triumphs. Nor was the warmth of the welcome
in any way associated with the much deprecated
""military spirit."" There was a special reason*
behind it which was alike creditable to those
who gave the welcome and those who received it.'
A not altogether unfounded impression had got
abroad that the- Artillerymen and Miners, if not
exactly the Cinderellas of the family in the late
Royal commemorations, had somehow teen kept
as far'as possible from the ""front"" when the fun
was going on; though it is now well., enough
known that they ? actually put in more realty
sound and serviceable work than if they had
been attending afternoon- tea parties or Tubbing
shoulders with Royalty and the peerage all the
time. The Major-General"", in welcoming the
men back, made mention of the fact* that they
had not been as well advertised as the-other
cbmpauies; ""but,"" said he, ""they had done good,
solid work,"" which was what they were sent
for. This was perfectly true. Did a Lancer
cleave a ""Turk's head,"" or cut a lemon in two,
or did one of our crack shots make a bull's-eye
at'Aldershot,' the fact was far better known
throughout New South -Wales, and, indeed, over_
all Australia, than if Moore Park or Randwick
had been the scene. Whereas, beyond the cir
cumstance that on one occasion Captain Dangar,
Captain Cansdell, Lieutenánt Lamb, and their
brother officers had been presented to the August
,-Lady whose reign we were all rejoicing over, we
heard nothing by cable of the doings of the
Artillerymen and the Submarine Miners. Tho
truth is they were more usefully employed than
being merely out for the show. After the first
month, which they spent in Chelsea Barracks,
the Field Artillery went into solid training at
Aldershot, the Garrison Artillery were taken to
the Isle of Wight, and the Submarine Miners
were quartered at Portsmouth. So that, though
they may háve-missed most of the glarñor of the
Jubilee, they-assuredly did not miss the more
solid advantages of a course of instruction in tho
best military schools in the kingdom.-A. .

The conversazione given last week by>Mr. Harry
S. Levy to introduce to the Sydney social and
musical world Messrs. Aitken and Lee-Williams
once more accentuates the deplorable poverty of
our mother tongue. It ls a little hard to have to
travel to Italian sources for a word to. describe the
most primitive form of entertainment. Even be
fore the days of Jubal (the Pandora of'mueic), man
kind doubtless met in a friendly way to dissect
(metaphorically and otherwise) their nearest ^neigh
bor, and the custom shows no sign of becoming ob
solete. . The^ woman (it must have been one) who
hit upon ithe terni ""at home"" showed an extraor
dinarily fertile- imagination, 'for it is the boast of
the Briton that the frivolous ^Frenchman has nb
equivalent, verbal or actual, for the term. Yet
for the orthodox ""at home"" some form of amuse
ment seems to be imperative, and the moat brilliant
talker is silenced by bhe ubiquitous musician or
the irrépressible reciter. The truth is that, sc
far from regarding conversation as one of the fine
arts, it is* hardly reckoned with even as a form of
amusement, and, like letter writing,-which was a
serious .study in the days of our grandmothers, the
science of apt and eloquent expression is woefully
neglected. Perhaps this accounts for our having
absolutely no Saxon word to describe a ""conver
sazione;"" even the word ""Parliament,"" borrowed
from the French, is strictly confined to regions
where talking has a financial value. The Germans
have a delightful * and characteristically onomato
poeic word ""Kaffee-ldaitsch,"" which hardly needs
translating into its equivalent ""coffee chatter,"" but
till conversation is recognised as a legitimate form
.of entertainment, and studied with the seriousness
pertaining to the-allied arts of dress, deportment,
and decoration, we shall he dependent on borrowed
terms for a fitting form of expression.--J.
Tho decision of the Full Court in the case of .
Baker v. Love, holding that the Corporation of'the
City of Sydney ;was entitled to prohibit hawking
in the city even by persons holding a hawker's >
licence for the whole colony, unless they held a !
licence from the council, may have-serious conse
quences. If.it is, as ""the, Full Court says it -Is,
legal for the City Council to make such a bylaw,
and impose,a licence fee"", what is to prevent the
other 181 boroughs or municipalities of the colony
from doing.'the "" same? True, "" the corporation
claims the powers under the Sydney Corporation
Act; but a not very wide reading of tire. 153rd sec
tion of the Municipalities Act would give like
power to the other municipalities. Some of them
doubtless will be glad of an opportunity to increase
their revenues, and eagerly seize it.; It certainly,
seems somewhat of an anomaly 'that when the*
Crown has granted a person a licence to hawk""all>L
over the colony"" a municipality should be able to
step in and say, ""You shall not do so unless y'oup
pay us a fee likewise."" Again, it .will ""be inter
esting to know if when the city corporation grants
a licence for its district the Crown can step in and
demánd the ordinary hawkers' fee also.TrU.:.

There was a .sham fight-duly cut and dried-in
Sydney on Saturday. The trouble about a shana
fight is the enormous size of ' the sham and. tko
microscopical dimensions of the fight. Real war
is getting harder and harder., to parody, and there
is a great deal of difference of opinion among gen
tlemen learned in military lore as to what the next
instalment of international homicide will be like.
We can thank our lucky stars.that our mimic battle
was not conducted on the lines of the recent sham
fight in Germany, virhere nine men and fourteen, _
horses were wounded-and that too in a display .
which the experts declare to be, in the light ot
modern armaments, merely a huge farce. Ouu. >
local sham fight may give us a pleasant sense of
security. The citizen may rest undisturbed by¡ ;.
the fear of Woolloomooloo falling into 'hostile
hands, or an arrogant foe dictating terms of peace -'
from Pinchgut. But:

By Henry Kendall.
The rain-clouds have gone to the deep -
The East like a furnance doth glow ;
And the Day-spring in flooding the steep,
And sheening the landscape below!
Oh ! ye who are gifted with souls
That delight in the music of birds,
Come forth where the scattered mist rolls,
And listen to eloquent words! --
Oh! ye who are fond of the sport,
And would travel yon wilderness through,
Gather each to his place - for a life-stirring chase
In the wake of the wild kangaroo!
Gather - each to his place -
For a life-stirring chase
In the wake of the wild kangaroo!
Beyond the wide rents of the fog,
The trees are illumm'd with gold ,
And the bark of the shepherd's brave dog
Shoots away from the sheltering fold!
Down the depths of yon rock-border'd glade,
A torrent goes foaming along;
While the blind owls retire into shade,
And the ""echu""* beginneth its song.
By the side at that yawning abyss
Where the vapours are hurrying to,
We will merrily pass, looking down to the grass
For the tracks of the wild kangaroo!
We will merrily pass,
Looking down to the grass,
For the tracks of the wild kangaroo.
Ho! brothers, away to the woods!
Euroka+ hath clamber'd the hill;
But the morning there seldom intrudes,
Where the night shadows slumber on still!
We will roam o'er these forest-land's wild,
And thread the dark masses of vines,
Where the winds, like the a voice of a child,
Are singing aloft in the pines!
We must keep down the glee of our hounds --
We must steal through the glittering dew;
And the breezes shall sleep, as we cautiously creep
To the haunts of the wild kangaroo!
And the breezes shall sleep,
As we cautiously creep
To the haunts of the wild kangaroo!
When we pass thro' a stillness like Death,
The swamp-fowl and timorous quail,
Like the leaves in a hurricane's breath,
Will start from their nests in the vale.
And the forester#, snuffing the air,
Will bound from his covert so dark,
While we follow along in the rear,
As arrows speed on to their mark !
Then the swift hounds shall bring him to bay,
And we'll send forth a hearty halloo;
As we gather them all, to be in at the fall --
At the death of the wild kangaroo!
As we gather them all,
To be in at the fall --
At the death of the wild kangaroo!

ON THE FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY OF HER BIRTH.
BRIGHT rise the sun, and grateful smile,
In bloom renew'd, each plant and flower;
Let joy each latent care beguile,
To grace dear SARAH'S natal hour!
Successive years, well pleased, have seen
The lisping babe, the artless child,
Till now she blooms at gay fifteen,
The flowret of Australia's wild.
Nor flattery shall the Bard degrade,
But truth pourtray (as meet it should)
The merits of this favorite maid,
Mild, tender, amiable, and good.
If, in the features, speaking lines,
The index of the heart we find;
In her that index well defines,
Sense, and intelligence of mind.
Nor less a temper prompt to please,
A heart, with tenderest feelings warm;
And (tho' inferior far to these)
Enshrin'd within a lovely form!
O! may the future years that glide,
View her in grace, and worth improved;
Her parents' comfort, and their pride,
Lov'd--and deserving to be lov'd!
Calm and serene may seasons roll;
And, as this festive day recurs,
May ripening virtues grace her soul,
And may increasing bliss be her's!
May she adorn her destined sphere,
Where may earth's* choicest blessings blend;
And still deserve, each circling year,
Th' esteem and praises of her friend!

A LL the fever, all the passion; stirs no
longer in my blood,
Which summer at its maddest swept o'er
me like a flood.
Theres a melancholy sweetness in these
chilly Autumn days,
Spite the gracious golden glory of the
wattles all ablaze;
Spite the clear, breath-taking beauty of
soft skies, delphinium blue,
Where the clouds are veils of gossamer
with rich sunlight flooding through.
The bush fires on Mt. Coot-tha are like
sentry fires at night,
And the moonlight has no softness,
crystal-dear and diamond-bright
Brisbane sits, a proud young city, on her
seven hills like Rome,
And in this enchanted weather calls her
truant children home.
And they come to share the magic of
her air like tonic wine,
And she spreads a glowing canvas where
barbaric colours shine.
Rich bignonia venusta weaves a living
tapestry,
And the spendthrift sun at noonday bids
the winds of winter flee.
See, the rebel bold poinsettia sounds her
loud defiance here,
Crying ""While my flag is flying Winter
never shall come near!""
While the gorgeous bougainvillea waves
beribboned arms around
Stately palms and ragged fences till the
city's crimson-gowned.
What a regal feast of splendour set for
folk of everyday!
Earth revives Spring's rainbow colours
though the Spring is far away.
So in Life's half-wistful Autumn, when
Youth's sparkling tale is told,
May we wake some inward radiance —
and grow lovelier, growing old.

""Are there not modern Heroines of peace as well
as ancient Heroines of war?""—CARLYLE.
Brave were the Spartan mothers, who could stand,
Prepared for Sparta their own blood to shed;
Ana give to thoso thoy loved that Btern command—
""Baok with your shields or borne upon them dead.""
Not lera heroic thou of whom I sing,
Not less thy triumph in Life's battlefield;
And now tbo Fates with kindly sorrow bring
Tbeo home, fair Heroine, on thy snow-white shield.
In Meero's lake the Lotus Naiad grew
Blue lilies from Nyeera's sacred seed
As burial wreaths for thoso tho angels knew
Immaculately pare in word and deed.
Worn, weary soul, the Naiad calls thy name,
And in thy white hand softly bjds tbee take
The last sweet proof of thine unsullied fame,
Blue lilies from tho Meeroanian lake.

Farewell, Nymboi River!
[WRITTEN FOR THE QUEENSLANDER.]
J.A. STUART.
Dawson River, 1888.
There comes to me across the years
The faint sweet memory of a day
When, with regretful bitter tears,
From Nymboi stream I turned away,
And onward went against my will,
Bore weary with the dust and beat,
And longing much to linger still,
In Nymboi's depths to lave my feet.
I longed to linger there beneath
The leaning beantree's tempting shade,
To loll at ease and softly breathe
The music that her murmurs made.
But Fate had bade me move along ;
So onward, at a dreary pace,
I went, sweet streamlet of my song !
With aching heart and doleful face.
Then, toiling up the flinty track,
I paused upon the wind-blown rise;
Dear Nymboi ! looking fondly back,
A foolish mist was in my eyes.
Had I my wish, oh tuneful spring !
Beside thee would I tarry long,
And, when thy hill-born waters sing,
Would pen perchance a pensive song.
But wearily I wander forth—
A dull home-sickness in my soul—
Just facing, at haphazard, north
To some indefinite shadowy goal. * * * * * * *
And here at noon, where shade is scant,
The stifling gidya-scrub among,
For one cool draught from thee I pant,
Thou streamlet of my dreams and song!
Here longing (by the streamless creeks
Scorched by the torrid Queensland sun)
For where, round base of lofty peaks,
Thy waters, Nymboi, gently run.
Perhaps, when by some sun-dried bole,
O'er my poor carcass eagles scream,
Obeying Life's great wish, my soul
May hover still near Nymboi stream.",The Queenslander ,"861,482,688,670,208,839,590,549,553,613,564,582,534,594,528,653,543,597,586,470,594,596,532,594,588,500,571,516,601,626,481,574,534,665,660,521,642,661,643,660,617,539,645,599,572,613",Sat 16 Aug 1890,"272,567,687,773,2317,2342,849,876,910,942,981,1008,1043,1074,1131,1161,1197,1227,1265,1298,1326,1362,1419,1449,1482,1515,1553,1583,1617,1652,1707,1739,1773,1806,1883,1918,1951,1983,2016,2046,2082,2117,2169,2205,2238,2266","406,605,499,512,1047,416,498,526,498,526,496,526,496,526,496,528,496,528,496,528,496,535,496,524,496,526,496,524,496,528,496,524,496,524,496,528,496,528,496,528,496,528,496,526,496,526",20285316,Page 305

Consider well the part in which you
play
With a ballot truly secret-not in fear.
You still have many hours to cast
your vote;
Think well and save the links which
hold
By voting Adams, Clark and Hill
And place them topmost at the poll.
Link up the broken chain and cast
your anchor ;
Upon a base of indépendance stand;
And stop for all time the drifting
nature
Of the Direct Action and extremists'
band.
With Adam's, Clark and Hall duly
elected
Labor will truly have 'gained itsjjoal. -

THE SPORTSMAN'S CODE.
Now these are the laws of the athlete.
That stretch the length of the field. *
They make the code of the runner fleet
Who has never yet learned to yield.
They tell you how to lay your plan,
And how to carry it through.
They help the man, who's done what he can.
To bear his Waterloo.
Ton shall give the foeman all his due,
And let him win if he can;
But keep all right that belong to you.
For that is the law of man.
You shall hold the ground that is yours by right,
And yield not a foot you have trod.
But grant his right in a stand-up fight,
For that is the law of God.
If you row with the crew in the boat,
It's a wretched thing to spy.
There's plenty of work when you leave the float,
But little to do for the eye.
v There's plenty to do to swing and slide,
And steady the fragile shell,
But to gain your strength from the other side
Is a method sent from hell.
No man shall yield on the football field
Till the final whistle sounds.
No man shall show by a Bingle blow
That he has nd place on the grounds.
But when the"" foe is in racking pain
And cannot move cr fight,
You shall help him up to his feet again,
And chafe his bruise and bind his strain,
To show the make of your own good grain, .
For that is fair and right.
The strength of the team, or nine, or crew
Is not the strength of the ""star.""
'Tis what the body together can do
That carries the vic""t\ry far.
So you shall give your mite to th3 rest
To bring the whole team through,
And then at the time of your single test
They shall give theil strength to you.
And these are the laws of the athlete.
You can heed them or not, as you like,
But they make the code of the runner fleet,
And they check a man when he'd strike.
They tell you how to lay your plan,
And how to carry it through.
They help the man, who's done what he can,

Which every man must pay upon demand;
And he who never paid one debt before,
Must pay this debt, and never pay one more;

BY HENRY KENDALL.
I PUaroSED onco to tako my pon and write,
Not songs like some tormented and awry
With passion, but a cunning harmony
Of words and music caught from crien and height,
And lucid colours born of woodland light,
And shining places whoro tho sea streams lie ;
But this was when tho heat of youth glowed white.
And since I've put tho faded purposo by,
I have no faultless fruits to offer you
Who read my lays; but oertain syllables
Therein aro borrowed from unfooted dolls,
And secret hollows dear to noontide dew ;
And these at least, though far bctweon and few,
May catch tho sense like subtle forest spells.
So tako thom kindly, oven though thoro bo
Somo notes that unto othor lyres bolong:
Stray cohoes from tho older sons of song j
And think how from its neighbouring, native sea
Tho peusivo sholl doth borrow melody.
I would not do tho lordly-masters wrong,
By filching fair words from the shining throng
Whoso musio haunts mo, as tho wind-a troo !
Lo, when a stranger, in soft Syria's glooms
Shot through with sunset, treads tho cedar dolls ;
And hears tho breezy ring of elfin bolls
Far down by whore tho white haired cataraot
booms,

Boars thonco, unwitting, plunder of porfumos.",Australian Town and Country Journal ,"422,428,792,747,695,891,757,835,913,739,677,743,772,758,873,805,767,748,758,875,706,746,844,834,783,909,701,918,126,915,831",Sat 11 Oct 1879,"489,596,647,686,725,764,803,843,882,921,961,1000,1039,1079,1117,1157,1240,1280,1320,1359,1398,1437,1476,1516,1556,1595,1634,1674,1716,1752,1792","3627,3625,3353,3389,3388,3354,3353,3388,3353,3388,3353,3388,3388,3354,3352,3389,3355,3390,3391,3354,3354,3394,3390,3355,3391,3356,3356,3391,3428,3357,3391",70973630,Page 28

Friends, do ye think, thus far apart--
That, still to home-land feeling true,
The faithful magnet of my heart
Its trembling Index turns to you?
Friends, think you oft, what mem'ries press?
Thick coming thoughts that erst had power
With Sardius tints each hour to bless,
Circling thy minstrel in her bower!
Say, do you think--in days of yore,
What happy influences bound
Our day dreams, by Port Stewart shore,
And on ""the Causeway's"" classic ground?
Rosstrevor--Carlingford--Killowen--
Proud Down! and Antrim's silvery coast,
Alas! my world hath changed its zone:
Even dear familiar stars are lost.
Bright VEGA, here no sweetness sends;
But fairest of Night's gorgeous train,
The SOUTHERN-CROSS, above me bends,
Pointing my Northward course--in vain.
Could you but think what tears are wept!
For Christian voice--or hallowed fane--
Throughout the hundred Sabbaths, kept--
On lonely rock, and silent plain!
What longings for that old Church-bell,
'Till o'er-strained thoughts the heart beguile,
And on my ear its tollings swell,
As though I trod the sacred aisle.
Here Nature's bounties largely flow,
Her fairest treasures crown our care;
But oh! what aching void may grow
'Mid blessings it were bliss to share.
Then think, my friends, when poet's strain
Sings of the vine, and orange grove;
That one, beyond the Southern Main,
Looks back to Ireland's links of love.

(A FRAGMENT.)
A splendid Sun betwixt the trees -
ling spikes of flame did shoot ;
When turning to the fragrunt South,
With longing eyes and, burning mouth,
I stretched a bond athwart the drouth,
' And plnckt at cooling fruit.
So thirst was quenched, and hastening os,
With strength returned to me,
I set my face against the Noon,
And reached a denser forest soon,
Which dipped into a still lagoon,
Hard by the Booming sea.
All d»y tba Oca» n beat on bar.
And bank of gleaming sand :
Yet that lone pool was always mild
It never moved when waves were wild,
But slumbered, like a quiet child,
Upon tbe lap of Lind.
And when I rested by the brink,
Amongst the fallen flowers,
I lay in calm ; no leaves were stirrod
By breath of wind, or wing of bird ;
It was so still, you might have heard
The footfalls of the hours.
Faint, slumbrous scents of roses Tilled
The air which covered me.
My words were low-"" She loved them to ;
In Fden vales such odours blotr ¡
How strange it is that roses grow
So near the shores of Sea !""
A sweeter fragrance never came
Across the neills of yore I
And when 1 said "" we here wonld dwell,]""
A low voioe on the silence fell -
'* Ah ! if yon loved the roses well,
You loved Ailoon the more. ""
.""Ay, that I did, and now would turn.
And fall, and worship her.'
But ob, yon dwell BO far- so high !
One cannot reach, though he may try,
The Morning hud. aud Jasper sky
The radiant hills of Myrrh.""
"" Why ver. me with delicious hints
Of fairest face, and rarest blooms ;
You Spirit of a darling Dream
Which links itself with every theme
Aid thought of mine by surf or st-cim,
Ia glens, or caverned glooms?""
She said "" Your wishes led me down
From amaranthine bowers :
And since my face was haunting thee.
With roses, dear, whioh ur ed to be
They all have hither followed me,
The (cents and shanes of flowers.""
"" Then stay, mine own evangel) stay.
Or, going, take me too ;
Bat te t me sojourn by your side,
If here we dwell or there abide,
It matters not !"" I madly cried,
"" I only care for you.*'.
O glittering form that wonld not stay !
0 sudden, sighing breeze !
A fainting rainbow dropped below
Far gleaming Peaks and walls of snow :
And there, a weory way, Tgo,
Toward the Sunrise Seas. _

Original Poetry.
The Power of Woman's Love.
CHRISTOPHUS.
OH, Woman! couldst thou estimate the power
By Heaven bestowed upon thy natal hour,
For good or ill—
The power to soothe our suffering and distress,
Or drive us to despair and bitterness,
Or further still-
Didst thou but know how one short word from
thee
A Heaven of bliss or hell of misery
Can in man's breast create-
Thou wouldst more wisely use a power so great,
And thus redeem us ere it is too late.
And who shall say that woman's influence sweet
Is powerless great emergencies to meet ?
A thing of nought—
That, 'neath its sway, no fallen man may be
From loathsome vice or hardoned villainy
To virtue brought?
Redeemed by woman's love, and kindly ways.
To pause, and turn, and think of other days.
He lies who says it. Deeply, doubly, lies.
He lies (ignorance deeming himself wise);
He knows not woman's power.
It hath a strength so holy, pure, and true
It cannot fail, whate'er it strives to do.
And in the darkest hour
It shines a beacon bright, illumining
A gloomy world of selfishness and sin.
I swear again, he lies. Mortal are all.
Were all men. since that first disastrous fall,
Wrought by a woman's hand.
And now with holy love she strives to make
Some reparation for a past mistake
And thro' the land
We see them, ministering angels, go
Assuaging sorrow and relieving woe.
Mortal were all. Mortal are all men now,
For, when th' Almighty first upon man's brow
His image stamped,
He fashioned all alike, with kindred fears
And hopes, ambitions, loves, growing with man-
hood's years.
We all are camped,
A mighty army, on a sunken plain,
But he who strives the topmost heights may gain.
There is no man so lost in vice and sin
But there exists a chink his armour in,
P'raps in its strongest part.
There is no man whose guiding star has waned
But has some feeble ray of good retained,
Deep buried in his heart.
Once strike the keynote to the mystery,
What follows then shall prove my prophecy.
And, quickened by the power of woman's love,
The meanest wretch shall raise himself above
Such misery.
And tho' a fall hath nevcr been so low,
And tho' his follies no restriction know,
He still shall be
Dragged from the mire of sins, which but increase
To honour, virtue, honesty—and peace.",The Queenslander ,"857,493,786,268,849,773,272,850,677,302,904,79,635,496,874,672,894,738,359,805,766,343,841,802,748,766,559,753,703,441,672,686,694,804,537,806,651,334,667,677,770,829,359,759,883,230,351,639,905,696,707,491,861,757,451,718,803,855,839,234,703,719,286,905,714",Sat 6 Oct 1883,"422,663,784,3074,863,893,928,961,1006,1030,1063,1096,1131,1167,1198,1233,1290,1323,1357,1391,1424,1460,1493,1526,1581,1616,1646,1682,1717,1751,1784,1814,1872,1907,1942,1975,2009,2044,2076,2112,2167,2202,2236,2268,2302,2337,2372,2403,2438,2493,2528,2562,2595,2630,2665,2698,2731,2789,2822,2857,2890,2924,2957,2991,3024","461,636,477,1024,420,420,521,420,420,523,420,454,420,521,419,419,420,419,523,420,420,521,422,420,420,422,521,420,420,521,420,420,419,428,524,419,420,521,419,419,419,419,521,419,419,452,523,419,419,419,419,518,419,419,518,419,419,419,419,521,419,419,521,419,420",19793832,Page 553

! On ! the snow, the beautiful snow,
Filling the sky and earth below.
Over the housetops, over the street,
Over the heads nf the people you meet ;
Dancing-Flirting- Skimming along.
Beautiful suow ! it can do no wrong ;
Flying to kiss a fair lady's cheek,
Clinging to lips in frolicsome freak;
Beautiful snow from heaven above,
Pure aB an angel, gentle as love !
Oh ! the snow, the beautiful snow,
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go,
Whirling about in maddening fun ;
Chasing - Laughing-Hurrying by,
It lights on the face, and sparkles the eye
And the dogs with a bark and a bound
Snap at the crystals as they eddy around ;
The town is alive, and its heart in a glow,
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow
How the wild crowd goes swaying along,
Hailing each other with humour and song :
How the gay sleighs like meteors flash by,
Bright for the nrunent th^n lost to the eye ;
Binging-Swinging-Dashing they go
Over the crust of the beautiful snow ;
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,
To be trampled and tracked by thousands of feet,
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street.
Once I was pure aB the snow, but I fell,
Fell like the snow flakes from heaven to hell;
Fell to be trampled an filth in the street,
Fell to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat ;
Pleading-Cursing-Dreading to die,
Selling my soul to whoever would buy ;
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,
Hating the living and fearing the dead.
Merciful God, have I fallen so low ?
And yet I was once like the beautiful snow.
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,
With an eye like a crystal, a heart like its glow
Once I was loved for my innocent grace
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face
Fathers-Mothers-listers, all,
God and myself I havsj lost by my foll :
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by
Will make a wide sweep lest I wander too nigh ;
For all that is on or above me I know,
There is nothing so pure as the beautiful snow.
How Btrange it should be that this beautiful snow
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go !
How strange it should be when the night comes again,
If the snow and the ice struck mv desperate brain,
Fainting-Freezing-Dying alone,
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for a moan
To be heard in the streets of the crazy town,
Gone mad in the joy of snow coming down ;
To be and to die in my terrible woe,
With a bed and a shroud of the.beautiful snow.
HelplesB and foul as the trampled snow,
Sinner, despair not ! Christ stoopeth low
To rescue the soul that is lost in sin,
And raise it to life and enjoyment again.
Groaning-Bleedjng-Dying for thee,
The Crucified hung on the cursed tree !
His accents of mercy fell soft on thine ear,
"" Is there mercy for me ? Will he heed my weak prayer ?""
O God ! in the stream that for sinners did flow,
Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.",Australian Town and Country Journal ,"562,707,640,712,791,748,738,660,720,702,651,688,878,700,698,834,766,839,833,830,812,859,842,881,756,752,812,989,995,788,911,813,826,745,783,789,792,713,875,758,953,794,953,621,784,829,964,764,941,1000,876,1091,1016,684,868,890,874,725,949,800,814,733,811,753,780,849,1117,947,854",Sat 31 Mar 1877,"454,569,632,676,719,761,805,847,889,933,976,1067,1108,1154,1194,1238,1281,1322,1367,1411,1501,1544,1586,1629,1674,1719,1759,1798,1844,1936,1977,2024,2066,2108,2153,2195,2238,2282,2324,2418,2457,2505,2544,2590,2632,2674,2715,2763,2804,2894,2938,2978,3022,3069,3112,3154,3197,3243,3284,3375,3419,3464,3505,3548,3592,3634,3673,3719,3763","3957,3672,3685,3687,3686,3771,3684,3683,3686,3681,3680,3682,3682,3683,3769,3679,3680,3680,3681,3680,3679,3679,3680,3678,3765,3678,3677,3678,3678,3677,3678,3679,3678,3763,3677,3679,3679,3678,3679,3680,3679,3680,3680,3766,3680,3679,3683,3680,3680,3681,3682,3680,3680,3764,3683,3679,3680,3679,3681,3680,3680,3679,3680,3766,3681,3683,3681,3681,3681",70600136,Page 24

OUR bark, like a bird, takes her flight from the Tay,
With nearly three hundred souls on board,
And many are crowding to see her away,
But few who at parting one tear can afford.
They come not to sorrow, they come not to sigh,
But with three hearty cheers to bid us good bye,
And yet in their hearts they may wish us as well,
As if fast from their eye-lids the tear drops fell,
And mentally pray as they see us go forth,
Poor sons of a day! from the land of our birth,
That our beautiful bark may find on the deep,
The breeze still awake, and the tempest asleep,
Till that hour when a crowd like the present shall
stand,
And hail us with joy to Australia's strand,
That our days, as they fly, may be winged with con-
tent,
And our hopes realized to their utmost extent.
Hark! to the signal gun, it tells the heart,
That friends must now—perhaps for ever—part!
The sad uncertainty of future years,
Gives rise to thought, and serious thought to fears,
That now the eye its last long look may take,
Of those who ne'er forsook—could ne'er forsake,
Whose humble, honest, unpretending worth,
Must win regard while virtue's priz'd on earth.
In sorrows tide of tearful tenderness,
We press the hand we ne'er again may press!
And say—what ne'er by fond affection's ear,
Is heard without emotion, hope or fear—
Farewell! a lass, the saddest sound of all
That e'er from love's or friendship's lips did fall,
Farewell, that word remembrance tear will claim,
When cold the heart from which it warmly came.
Ah! happy they, whose hearts are moulded so,
Alike insensible to joy or woe,
That from the cradle onward to the grave,
Their owners scarcely know if hearts they have,
Let others livlier feelings glow or freeze,
Their minds are placid, and their souls at ease,
They ne'er at parting, turn to hide their grief,
And seek in solitude and tears relief,
In equanimity they calmly dwell,
Nor feel that throb which they could wish to quell,
Their home, their country, is the world at large,
No charge but self, that most precarious charge!
From scene to scene, from clime to clime, they range,
Enjoy the hour and never feel the change,
The ills of life which all are doom'd to bear
Press light on them—their future hath no fear!
Heave up the anchor, hear the Captain cry,
Ay, ay, sir, is the seaman's prompt reply,
And while they heave with brawny arm and strong,
They join, to cheer their labour, in a song,
And who so well as those who plough the main,
Can sing a cheerful, and heart-stirring strain?
Their hearts, their souls, into the song they throw,
And kindling sing till others listening glow,
And feel that nature, simple, unrefined,
Hath but to speak to win the willing mind.
One takes the lead, whose lungs make language tell
Then leaves his mates to bid the chorus swell,

-, Jípr^is there an atom of sympathy

the old dusky-whiskered battler/*'lou
sing the -'hopper"" in expectation of
rnnding the slug that never material-
ised, and probably never,will.
But to the mau who ? arrived ion the

«that ruled the roost nngroomed and
'unshaven, but bright-eyed and vigor-
ous/ iq^ the commencement of the nine-.

?,-:With\an idea' running ""somewhat in

my steps towards Gassidy'g Hill to

dayp ' of ""Hannans ""were discoverable
?aeaongst the grass-grown - - tailings
dumps stretching away -anywhere from
its base. ' »
Maritana ' Jlill, the Cement. Lead,
Heil Bill, and Paisley's Gully, all
within a small radius, were well
known names with the 'blowers then,
almost as well-known as Fly Speck
.Plat ¿at Coolgardie, ami there was a
stronger throb of virile ""life"" in the
undefined* expectancy ot thbse hurly

something that looked like open hos-
tility. He had the long, beard and .
""battered appearance ' of a pioneer, bat
I was not going to allow myself' to
be betrayed into making jany advances
on- that account, and when he reared
himself on his hind legs a second time

I Ifefc Him have a hunk of diorite the
size- of a half-brick; in the ribs, and
he rolled down the other side <A the
heáp to think ¡the matter-over.
Presently I heard the familiar rattle
of-a .shaker, and bore down on my
quarry to 'find out what year the ope-
rator was branded. And here fist lt
be said that 'every one' of the names
included in this /screed is i that of some ;
mali, who has done his» full share to- '

those they paved tbp way for. *
. I -was. not long in ingratiating my-
self ¿with Tom Bentley, who, with his
mata, arrived at Gnarlbine Soak just '
as Beidy was taking away the last
half-load of water from it at the time
of rtfae big Coolgardie drought. (This
is the «same Beidy who was lately con-
victed of - vagrancy, - but was then
known as one of the luckiest and most
open-handed of all, ""the put-back pros- i

And Stockmen whistle and shout.
Old draughting gates creak to and fro'
As the Overseer ""culls"" out.
It's ""Block 'Em!"" here, and ""Open!"" there
Till the final muster's made
Of some of the finest stock that's bound
For the Bowen Park parade!
'THERE are horns to polish and hoofs to trim
And sleek, warm coats to brush.
And a score of elusive, swishing tails
To ""bang"" in the dipping ""crush"".
There are loads of fodder to bale and rail
And the thoroughbreds to shoe.
And in case the* weather should prove unkind
There's rugging to think of, too!
•^HERE'S the riding gear to soften and shine,
And there must be no delay
- In running the road mounts in—their Mountain
Paddock's some miles away—
For the drovers are due for the sunset trail
In the wake of the mulgas' shade.
And it's little they'll care- for sleepless nights
En route to the Grand Parade!
be lilting laughter and care-free joy
For some at the journey's end!
While back where the hills sweep down to the plains
Are others with work to tend.
There'll be friends of old who will gladly meet
And many a new one made.
When the Condamine greets the Central-West
At the coming Grand Parade!
BRUCE QUARTERMAINE
Spahlinger Vaccine
Experiments with the Spahlinger
vaccine for tuberculosis are being/jtr
ried out in Ireland, as well as in J^>
land. The Ulster Minister for Agri
culture (Sir Basil Brooke), in moving
the"" minutes of liis department in the
Northern Ireland Parliament recently,
said that the vaccine had conferred a
high degree of immunity against a
lethal dose of tubercle injected into the
blood stream, and at least an equally
high degree of immunity against in
tense natural infection during a period
of approximately two years. Such
highly satisfactory results raised the
question of the compulsory use of the
vaccine as a means of eradicating
tuberculosis from Ulster herds. As a
first step towards that object it was
desirable to clear up two points, and
these would be the subject of further
experiments. One of these had already
started, and the other would start a_s
soon as Mr. Spahlinger could provide
a further supply of vaccine.

I stood in the Temple of Silence
Where in crimson splendour shone
The rich light through stained windows
O'er a matchless crystal throne.
And a vista of stately pillars
Stretched far 'neath a dome of gold,
And sculptured recumbent figures
Of mortals of kingly mould.
Yet with all its surpassing beauty
I could feel the icy breath
Of the wings of some brooding phantom
In this gilded house of death.
Here no sound ever broke the stillness,
Here solitude e'er abode,
I stayed till the moonbeams quivered,
Then left Silence alone with God.
I stood in the Palace of pleasure,
The revels were wild and gay,
And mocking laughter rose and fell
As the swift hours sped away.
The lights waxed dim, and the flowers
Drooped dead in the gorgeous bowls,
And the pitited faces anon grew sad
And mirthless their empty souls.
The long night waned, and the dancers,
Their beauty all faded and worn,
Looked pallid, and listless, and weary,
In the rays of the glorious morn.
Ever seeking ephemeral pleasure,
Which leads to the pith of pain,
And down to the Valley of Never,
Whence none may return again.
I stood in Life's garden of beauty,
And, lo : in a floral shrine
Of roses and lilies entwining
Lay a chalice of dew Divine.
And a throng of mortals stood waiting
For the Angel of Love to pour
This holy dew of libation,
Which falleth for evermore.
And children were weaving garlands
As they walked o'er the verdant sward
With the flowers of Truth and Perfection
In sunlight which ever poured.
And here, in this new earthly Eden,
With its gleaming wings of white,
Was Peace, for all men were Brothers-
I awoke from my dream : ""'Twas night!""

Turkish embroideries, which, as is
well known, are largely in chain
stitch, bid fair to be in fashion.
Bulgarian embroideries, notably is
the floral designs affected by the
peasant class, are prominent among
novelty trimming., both for dresses
and for millinery. Bright coloured
tassels, such as are frequently noted
on the costumes of the native orient-

unexpected ways in the new costumes

CHILDREN.
The beginning of a manuscript poem, entitled "" The
Bushranger.""
Unfolding fair in sorrow's shade,
Like early flowers 'mid frost and snow;
How sweet, where grief her home hath made,
The heedless infant hearts, which glow
And gladden still with happiness,
We fondly pray may ne'er be less !
Howe'er the bosom bleed within,
Probed deeply by remorseful sin,
Or bruis'd by outward woe, the while;
How precious every infant smile,
Which innocence sheds round our path,
Like mercy's ray dispelling wrath !
Howe'er the joyous accents spoken,
May wound the beast already broken,
And make it feel more sorrowful;
How welcome still each syllable,
Which children, in their happy time,
Breathe, ere their souls have leant to crime !
Alas ! and the beloved child,
Who, rosy with confusion, smiled
When embryo reason's utterance hung
In broken sweetness on his tongue;
And fain, with clear expressive eye,
Each latent thought he would convey;
So lovely as to make us weep,
Because we may not, must not keep,
Where sunbeams vanish, flowers depart,
Unchanged, such treasure of the heart;
And he, when years are rolled away,
Will curse his fellow-man and slay !
Oh, where in this wide world is he,
A child again who would not be?
Poets have not one glorious flower
Too many, wreathed o'er childhood's bower :
Hearts which are blackest grown with guilt--
Hands reddest with the blood they've spilt--
Could they annul the fearful past,
The first to dictate to the last,
Would play with roses still, and be
Children through all eternity.

Why don't you take the rail ?
The rail will take you whisking past

The fares is fixed uncommon low

That's olear to any Moke,
Beoause you oannot spend your browns.
In brandy, beer, and smoke,
A man's a Nasa that's siok at se«,
At him I do deride,
But woman is a tender flower,
And delicate inside ;
And whon I sees 'em stoop their heads,
Unable to contain,
I feels inolincd to kick tho brutes
' That brought 'em on tho main.
Their little small contrairy ways
Whioh they delight to show,
As over to the windard side
When ill they always go,
And safe to rush where Neptune's splash
' Has made the Beats a slop,
These fads of theirs amuse me
Whon fetching of my mop.
I pities them, and pities moro
The little ohildren small,
As never ought for to be brought
Aboard a boat at all.
And when they retobos, pretty dears,
And bowls in grief and woe,

BE patient, anxious, throbbing heart,
Abide thy time, act well thy part,
Be to thy purposo true ;
The present hour alone is thine :""
Tho' dark the night, do not repine,
The future keep in view.
And tho' the rising sun be veiled,
And its bright light by clouds be paled,
Perchance before the noon,
Dispersed each lowering cloud will be,
Leaving it shining clear and free
Prom morning's darkening gloom.
This restless, pleasing, suffering lot,
Prom cradle life to grave-yard plot,
Is but a changing scene ; -
Pond hopes, dark fears, glad joy, stern woe,
Alternately come and go
As in a troubled dream.
Trust not to fate, nor blindly tread
The thorny path with fear and dread ;
Trust to thy Father's care,
Who thy true efforts will attend,
Then Confidence with Hope will blend,
And banish blank Despair.
Be patient, studious, thoughtful brain
Dost think thou canst at once attain
The pinnacle of fame !
Offsprings o£ many a weary hour
One day may testify thy power,
And spread thy honoured name.
Be patient, pain-racked, mortal frail,
Condemned to live without the pale
Of Heaven's great blessing-health.
Bitter indeed the cup must bo,
But in the vast eternity
Shall live thy better self.
No resting place on earth is found, .
The camp fire ashes scattered round
Reiterate the talo ;
Nor will impatient longings cease,
Till gained are boundless realms of peace
Bevond tho shadowv vale.

And ne'er looks baok as they gaily speed,

Ah ! the old story, so often told,
Of a love too easily given.

And lett her poor heart riven.

! has two or three samples of verse to submit to you.
First, two sugested by little boys who did not find
Christmas sufficiently elastic. The third about the
New Year that has just tripped into the world:
A LITTLE BOY'S PLAN.
""If I had made tho calendar,"" said Bobbie, yester-
day,
""I sort of think I'd have lt fixed in somewhat dif-
ferent way,
I'd not have put the Christmases so very far apart;
I think that six months 'tween 'em would please any
youngster's heart.
¡ ""And scattered through, the other months I'd have
a lot of times
On which we'd decorate the house and gally ring
the chimes;
On which we'd have, not Santa, hut some other Saint
! lllce him,
! Who'd go about and gratify pur every little whim.
""Who'd bring us cakes and candy in the middle of
July;
Who'd bring us cans and waggons when the Juno
sun's In the sky;
i Who when September came about would bring us
I lots of things
To malee us all as happy as a baud of Brownie Kings.
""In this way we'd have lots of things a-coniing all
I tho year,
And walting for the Christmas-time would not be
long and drear,
And best of all we'd not wear out our toys, and I
am sure
Tho old ones would be newer when we gave 'em to
the poor.""
A MAGNIFICENT SCHEME.
He was a tiny little lad, he was so full of schemes.
He wasn't greedy, but he had the most ambitious
droams.
Ho wanted every other child to have all sorts
of toys,
And never envied any of tho other little boys.
Dut as he thought of Christmas-time, and all
the joys lt brings,
And pondered o'er the hundred and the thousand
lovely things
Ho thought he'd like old Santa Claus to leave
when he Bhould call,
It filled him full of misery, his stocking was so
small.
""He cannot got ft quarter oí tlio things I want
thereiui
My stockings aro not very long, and, oh, my legs ^
are thin!
I wonder what I'd better do-the stockings will
not stretch.
They will not hold a hundredth part of what I
hope he'll fetch.""
And then he asked his mamma on what day
Santa'd come,
And when she said, ""On Tuesday,"" he just bit
his little thumb,
And said, ""Ha! ha! That's drying-day. I've got
a little plan:
I'll go and see the laundress,"" said this funny
little man.
""I'll tell her that I sort of think she ought to
string a line
From mantel-piece to window in that nursery of
mine,
And hang the stockings that I wore last week
just seven pair
Upon it, so's old Santa will observe 'em when
he's there!""
A HAPPY NEW YEAR.
Just at the turn of the midnight,
When the children are fast asleep,
The tired Old Year slips out by himself,
Glad of a chance to be laid on the shelf.
And the New Year takes a peep
At the beautiful world that is waiting
For the hours that he will bring:
For the wonderful things in his peddler's pack;
Weather, all sorts, there will be no lack,
And many a marvellous thing.
Flowers, by hosts and armies,
Stars, and sunshine, and rain!
The merry times and the sorrowful times.
Quickstep and jingle and dirge and chimes,
And the weaving of joy and pain.
When the children wake in the morning,
Snouting their ""Happy New Year,""
The year will be started well on his way,
Swinging along through his first white day,.
With the path before him clear.
Twelve long months for his journey;
Fifty-two weeks of a spell;

STANZAS.
IN a morning of summer, my cares to beguile,
I strayed out to gaze on the green ocean's smile,
No sun-rays as yet their rich colouring gave,
But the ocean in silence rolled onward the wave.
And a dark cloud hung o'er it, until the gold sun,
From his pillow of waters his journey begun,
Then the shadow dissolved in a halo of light,
And the billows ebbed sweetly--delightfully bright.
Oh! thus may the sorrows that hang o'er my soul,
Like that shadow of darkness, far, far away roll;
And the moments of sadness be cheerful and gay,
While the rich sun of hope still illumines my way.

_
The old road north of Wiseman's
Climbs up by cliff and ledge,
On great, grey, lichened buttresses,
Above the river's edge;
For faithfully they packed the stone,
In Solomon his day,
And wearily the builders wrought,
Who never drew their pay.
To right the roofs of Windsor
Are glinting in the sun,
The mist is on the crossing place,
The day is now begun—
A long, long day of liberty,
With sun and road and sky--
Ah, pity their captivity,
Who toiled in days gone by!
The yellow of the cornland,
The cliff's enpurpled state,
The old stone house, where Wiseman dwelt,
With gryphon-guarded gate—
I wonder here what viewless ghosts
Tramp through the heat of noon,
If down the road the clank of chains
Is heard beneath the moon ?
Or if the ferry cable
Creaks ghostly in the night,
To bear across the phantom gang
That may not bide the light ?
Light hearts to whom this happy land
Is free and blessed abode,
Pass on your way, but, passing, bless
The makers of the road!

FOR HIS MAJESTY'S BIRTH-DAY.
BY MR. ROBINSON.
WHILST Grecian Legends proudly claim
The Triumph of their HOMER'S Name,
And MANTUA'S Bard, with fadeless Glory,
Crowns the bright Themes of classic Story, —
Surviving Genius fondly twines
Fresh Laurels round their hallow'd Shrines ;
And, from the Page of early Lore,
Loves to retrace those Days of Yore,
When the young Arts, by Learning nourish'd,
Burst from their Germs — matur'd — and flourished ;
And ATHENS, high, triumphant, and renown'd,
Saw her own Lustre gild the Nations round !
AND tho' succeeding Times displayed,
The Havock barbarous Hordes had made,
That swept with desolating Rage
The Boast of the AUGUSTAN Age ;
And hid, in cold oblivious Gloom,
The letter'd Pride of fallen ROME !
Still GENIUS slumber'd in the Waste,
To rise with freshen'd Grace at last :—
To see proud Science her fair Morn restore,
And shed her brightest Ray on ALBION'S Shore !
THEN SHAKESPEARE'S Muse, transcendent, hurl'd
Its Magic thro' a wondering World ;
Then MILTON'S bold aspiring Lyre
Glow'd with charm'd Fancy's hallow'd Fire;
And after Ages own'd, with Taste refin'd,
The boundless Empire of the human Mind !
AND, ALBION! Still on thy blest Isle
The Sister Arts supremely smile,
Protect the MUSES' favorite Seats,
And hover round their green Retreats.
HENCE, Fancy's Charm and Wisdom's Page
Have rais'd a New Augustan Age ;
And BRUNSWICK'S glorious RACE survives to own
A NATION'S TRIUMPH — AND A WORLD'S RENOWN !
To that high Race shall Genius bend,
Hail'd as her PATRON — GUARDIAN — FRIEND!
And blooming Wreaths, round Garlands gay,
Entwine on this auspicious Day.
OH ! could the Muse aspire to raise
To untrac'd Heights her Meed of Praise ;
This Morn should waken ev'ry Strain to Pleasure,
And her Lyre vibrate to the glowing Measure :
AND every BRITON, proudly sing,
A PRINCE ador'd — a PATRIOT KING!
Whose bright Career, from opening Youth,
Left the fond Pledge of FILIAL TRUTH ;—
THAT Pledge came pure from Virtue's Source,
And Honor mark'd its sacred Course;
Nor has a Gem more brilliant ever shone
To grace a MONARCH — or adorn His Throne !
AND, ALBION ! whilst thy glorious Arms
Have triumph'd 'midst the World's Alarms ;
And, with commanding Awe maintained,
The Fields thy gallant Warriors gain'd ;
Whilst suffering Nations round, afar,
Mourn the rude Ravages of War,
On thy calm Shores — thy smiling Plains,
PEACE, in her native Splendour, reigns, —
And laurel'd Trophies wave, in bright Array,
To grace, with festive Smiles, this halcyon Day !
AND, whilst AUSTRALIA'S favor'd Isle
Partakes the universal Smile,
And honors the benignant Hand
That nurtur'd first her Infant Land ;
SHALL not her PATRIOT CHIEF receive
All that fond Gratitude can give ;
Whilst every Heart responds to every Lay
That owns His fostering — His Paternal Sway!
THO' startled Hope, with anxious Eye,
And trembling Fear, with boding Sigh,
In chilling Sympathies await,
The Fiat of impending Fate. —
WHEN Time, that with relentless Power,
Sweeps the proud Dome and ""Cloud-capt Tower ;""
Shall steal with sullen Claim at last,
And mark His Reign of Glory past ;—
""REMEMBRANCE, LONG, TO PRIVATE WORTH ENDEAR'D,
SHALL HAIL THE FRIEND BELOV'D — THE CHIEF REVER'D !

Off came his little cap.
My door was shut ; he waited there
Until I heard his rap.

And when I dropped my pen,
He sprang to pick it up for me,
This gentleman of ten.
He does not push and crowd along ;
His voice is gently pitched;
He does not fling his books about
As if be were bewitched.
He stands aside to let you pass;
He always shuts the door ;
He runs on errands willingly
To forge and mill and store.
He thinks of you before himself ;
He serves you it'he can ;

THE JANISSARIES' LAMENT.
Gladios accingite socii,
Per patriam dilectam,
Per manes pa rum,
Per caras conjuges,
Et liberos raptos,
Pœnas dabint tyranni.
SHALL the gleam of our sabres no more shed dismay,
When we wield them on high in red battle's array,
The dread war-cry Insh Allah be thundered no
more,
As our falchions are buried in infidel gore.
Through ages of glory--the fierce Janissier,
Carried death to his foes on the point of his spear;
Midst the whirr of the bullet, the scymitars' clash,
He swept on his steed like the lightning's wild flash.
Where the standard of Osman unrolled to the wind,
Terror marched in its front--desolation behind;
The uncircumcised Christian dogs paled with
affright,
As the turban and crescent came on in their might.
Through helmet and cuirass--straight down through
the head,
As in fury we struck, our scymitars sped;
Where we rushed in the fight--there the corpses
were strewn,
Before us the valiant--behind us the groan.
But our glory has perished--the traitor and slave,
Now lord in the halls which were won by our
glaive;
Our Ortas and Ensigns are trampled in dust,
Our daughters subservient to Ottoman lust.
But again--but again will our valour prevail,
Again at our rising will Sultans turn pale;
The Janissier again keen sabre in hand,
To the conquered and terrified issue command.
We have sworn by the Prophet our wrongs to
avenge,
With hearts nerved by hate--arms bared for re-
venge;
Through thy streets, O Stamboul, shall be heard
the wild shriek,
The death scream of our foes when our vengeance
we wreak.
By the God of our fathers, the harem and mosque,
Shall be gilt with the flames of each burning
kiosque;
In the dead of the night, whan the Moslem lords
rest,
With shout, sword and torch we their domes will
invest.
At the clang of our arms--at our torches' red glare,
They shall wake but to perish in craven despair;
Their mansions reecho our dread battle cry,
As their heart's blood our garments and ataghans
dye.
Then again shall victorious the flag be displayed,
Of the dauntless in soul--of the never dismayed;
The Giaours of the west again shiver with fear,
At the lance and the sword of the stern Janissier.",The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser ,"504,471,516,333,498,354,290,359,453,739,737,738,81,652,617,740,738,740,735,706,739,115,742,740,133,617,738,185,637,720,740,104,661,636,658,620,576,682,737,113,736,109,736,226,737,148,724,746,128,740,66,739,99,740,714,636,742,79,721,736,693,727",Tue 9 Jun 1840,"512,584,652,724,754,795,830,864,900,967,1002,1036,1083,1106,1154,1189,1223,1258,1306,1341,1375,1411,1445,1492,1530,1563,1598,1639,1668,1715,1751,1786,1819,1855,1901,1936,1970,2004,2051,2096,2119,2165,2188,2227,2259,2298,2341,2377,2414,2446,2487,2515,2553,2598,2634,2669,2702,2734,2784,2820,2854,2890","365,384,350,452,452,375,455,348,329,248,247,246,284,244,246,244,246,248,249,247,247,286,248,250,285,250,252,287,251,248,250,287,246,251,248,249,249,248,249,285,249,285,250,286,249,284,248,245,287,250,285,250,283,249,250,250,247,275,249,252,251,247",2547354,Page 4

A soug to the Democracy I chant:
Is it not time you ceased bowing to mono
grams aod rings,
And canfsand gloves and all asBerfeiveness?
And ceased to do business with institutions
tnat patronise and Boom you—
The time, cramming their cupboards from
your scanty barns ?
Jrlow long ere you teach children to dis
tinguish education from goodness,
And -affable manners from goodness ?
And before you teach them that courage
of tea serves selfishness ? _
And how education is the indispensable
instrument of swindling ?
You seem unable to detect the untrust
worthy gentleman.
1 will tell yon his fashion :
Hp is at oase amqng men ;
Courageous, affable, obliging, kind, of
pleasant appearance
These tilings because they are pleasant to
him,
They are powwful aids to hi* ends also.
You will detect hun by his delight of
Ample comfort.
By paying his labourer*; Imt a tenth of the
sum ho charges fur a like amount of
work.
Plainly, he is announced by hi- resppet of
costly clothe
By his determination to lift on in th*4
World,
By his coneealed fast-clinging to saluted
positions, , -
By his prudent reticence at public meetings,
By his flaunting of the Labour candidate.
Democracy, teach your children to loathe
these men and women.
Come, conclude discussion.
By ju.«tice~you can starve the lawyer,
By your post-office mu?h of the profit of
exchange can Ijc placed in your_ public
pocket. ' ' —

are digging your graves. Do sdme

Agen ago a Democrat sang the song I echo.
You caught the tune, and your enemies
supplied false verse, —
Now 1 give you the true words.
Be friendly, just, and bold, and these with
out fear of poverty.

years sturdy,
Tears when the metal meant less

Tears before lite was a harsh hurdy

Tears when we followed the finger
of fate.

Of glittering ounces and shammies

A boon an' a blessin' to this
pious land.
A Savonarola, a Cromwell,
whose mole a
Poor artist saved whole, a
Comstock or a Knox—
These were hefty joy-biffers;
but, classed as sin-
sniffers
Our temp'rament differs.
We're out of the box!
We're pure politicians; we feels our
positions;
We feels that conditions in this 'oly
land
Is clean, if bucolic. All frivolous
frolic,
All views vitriolic, if furrin' is banned.
Tho' merely elected, we feels we're
expected,
When sin is detected approaching our
shore,
To sieze it an' sock it; before they can
dock it
We ruthlessly lock it outside of our
door.
With horror'we're smitten when Brit-
ain, admittln'
The stuff that is written by
sin-sodden blokes,
Condones evil-livers. It gives
us the shivers;
Our righteousness quivers to
hark at their jokes.
They falsely befriend us an'
seek for to send us
Them works wot would end
us in dreadful desire.
Tho' we scarce understand
'em, ere ever they lan's
'em
We scans 'em an' bans 'em
an' burns 'em with
fire.
Tho' tardy at dealin' with evils re-
vealin'
The need for appealin' to local reform,
We're apt to get winkin' an' bashfully
shrinkin'
When critics unthinkin' starts raisin'
a storm.
We're good at forgettin' that murder
an' sweatin'
An' startin'-price bettin' leaves much
to be done.
The land may be swimmin' in sin over-
brimmin' ...
But books, plays an' wimmin', we bans
'em like fun.
We bans 'em! We bars 'em ere ever
they lan's 'em.
Then, ""CENSORED!"" we bran's 'em.

A FAIRY STORY OF TO-DAY.
THEKE ia nothing to do, and there's nothing to say,
And the rain, it rainoth every day ;
There is nothing1 amusing, and nothing now,
In fact, as I said, "" there i°. nothing to do.""
So spoke littlo Gretchen, and turned again
To watching tho rain on tho window pane.
Now she cried, "" There's tho clock, but it only struck
two;
What is to bo dono, wkon thero's'nothing to do ?""
"" Nothing to do ! "" said a voice at her side,
' ' Would you like to como with me for a ride? ''
Then Gretchen turned round, most delighted to see
Her good fairy godmother smiling with glee, ? ""
Telling the Story.
And tho very first tap of her high-heeled shoes
Quite startled tho child from hor fit of the blues.
A neat little figure, so quaint and so trim,
Her little high hat had a littlo broad brim,
And her dainty rod petticoat, quilted and neat,
Showed tho high buckled shoes on her brisk little
feet.
"" Oh, yes ! cried poor Gretchen, "" pray take me with
you,
Asl really am dying for something to do.""
""Very well,"" said her godmother, "" prithee be
quick,
And jump by my aide on this fairy broomstick.
It does not rain now, and wo will not go far,
So don't stay to dress, but come just as you aro.""
Quoth Gretchen, *' I'll get hat and cloak ero wo go j
I am not quite a fairy as you aro, you know.""
The broomstick was swift, and the broomstick was
fleet,
So, it soon set them down in tho near village Btreot.
""And now,"" said tho fairy, "" you just follow mo,
I hav9 touched you with fern sood, so no one will
see.""
Then straightway she opened a rickety door,
And they saw a poor baby alono on tho floor ;
Such a pitiful baby, so palo and so thin,
With hardly a garment to wrap itself in.
It gave littlo Gretchen a sorrowful shock,
And she said, ""I must mako that poor baby a
frock."" ?
Her godmother nodded, and merrily smiled,
But soon she led Grotchon away from the child,
And showed her its mother, who lay on tho bed,
With scarcely a pillow to ease her poor head.
Said Gretchen, "" She looks very ill, don't you think,
11 may bring her some food or somo nioe cooling
I drink?""
Her godmother gave to her broomstick a twirl,
And thoy stood by tho sido of a little lame girl ;
Sho had no ono to comfort hor hour af tor hour.
Cried Grotchon, "" I should liko to bring her a
flower !""
"" Very good,"" quoth tho fairy, ""pray doit if you
can ;
But, now, ooine and call on my poor old blind man.""
"" Oh, doar."" said her godchild, how lonely he looks !
Might I read to him sometimes somo comforting
books P
"" And, O godmother, look at that poor littlo lad,
Ho is shaking with cold, and so wretchedly clad,
While I am wrapt in this velvet and fur !
Don't you think I may make him a warm comforter?""
"" Our ride,"" said the fairy, "" has not been in vain,
And now, if you pleaso, wo will fly homo again,
I will call on you, dear, just a week from to-day,
And then I shall hoar what you then have to say.""
The week went by, and the godmother came
In her little red petticoats, gay as a flame.
She tapped tho floor, and sho laughed outright
To see her fair godchild so busy and bright.
Then Gretchen looked up with a sunshiny smile, I
And she folded her work in a neat littlo pile.
She laid it a-top of her plentiful store,
Saying, ""Now that is done, I can make something
more.
The days aro so busy, I rise with the sun,
But I never can do all there is to be dono.

Than poppies still in the pale air?
Scarlet and pink and snowy white,
Like chalices of woven light.
Coloured with life, yet all at rest
Upon the brown earth's quiet breast.
Their petals seem in peace to keep
The tincture of eternal sleep.
Perchance they know in secrecy
Some sacred, mystic reverie,
Holding within their transient breath
The dream-seeds of immortal death.

A Day That is Dead.
BARVILLE HAMPTON.
Townsville, September, 1889.
Was I dreaming in the twilight when I thought I heard
your tread,
And felt the pressure of your hand, and heard the words
you said!
Did it hap, or was it fancy, that you whispered as or
old! _
Aa I retted 'neath the wattle tree where first our love
was told.
The earth waa wrapped in glory, for the summer sun
had set,
But your presence brought back sunshine, and it seemed
day lingered yet.
The old dull aching in my heart seemed gone with each
past care,
The world held nought of danger, love, but I for you
would dare.
W» wero walking 'neath acacias* boughs as of t in days
gone by,
And, lingering by the crystal stream, we watched the
daylight die:
The ripple of the streamlet seemed to lull my aching
brain,
And in the musio of your voice my heart forgot ita pain.
I was dreaming: ah, the waking from that long re
membered bliss
Was death unto my longing heart, and in that faltering
kUa
I felt our last good-bye was said, our hut fond parting
o'er;
' T was but a dream, love, sent to tell that we shall meet
no more.",The Queenslander ,"858,482,664,578,339,472,900,179,899,154,900,648,900,147,901,128,900,271,901,155,901,192,901,137,901,212,900,96,900,886,255,900,66,900,76,899,143",Sat 26 Oct 1889,"416,707,841,906,2098,2132,992,1028,1057,1096,1135,1162,1189,1224,1280,1318,1346,1378,1413,1452,1480,1518,1569,1608,1636,1676,1706,1743,1770,1828,1866,1894,1932,1962,2002,2028,2076","345,528,435,480,852,351,318,384,318,384,317,384,317,387,317,381,317,386,317,383,317,383,317,381,317,383,317,383,317,317,386,317,383,317,384,318,386",19818136,Page 785

How ofb thy praises ring, ""
For poets, love to sing .
Of thee sweet flower.
In every shady nook,
Or by the running brook ;
Or where *e least would look,
Thou shed'st thy power.
Thy sweet retiring ways,
Demand a song of praise,
Nor are man's sweetest lays
Enough for thee.
Though small, with fragrance blest,
So modest, so at rest,

Thy perfume rises highest,
When thou dos't cease.
May I resemble thee
And God in nature see.
And bless. His name that He
To me has given
A life that I might know,
And ease some soul of woe,
Then leave my name below,
And fly to heaven.

FASHIONABLE EDUCATION.
ANTI..
D EAR MADAM, I've called for the purpose
Of placing my daughter at school;
She's only thirteen, I assure you,
And remarkably easy to rule.
rd hare her learn painting and music,
Gymnastics and dancing, pray do,
Philosophy, grammar, and logic;
You'll t«ach her to read, of course, too.
I wish her to learn every study,
Mathematics are down in my plan ;
But of figures she scarce has an inkling.
Pray instruct her in those if you can.
I'd have her taught Spanish and Latin
Including the language of France •
Never mind her very bad English,
Teach her that when you find a good chance.
On the harp she must be a proficient,
And play the guitar pretty soon,
And ring the last opera music.
Even though she can't turu a right tune.
You must see that her manners are finished,
That she moves with a Hebe-like grace;
For though she is lame and one-sided,
That's nothing to do with the case.
Now, to you I resign this young jewel.
And my words I would have you obey;
In six months you return her, dear madam,
Shining bright as an unclouded day.
She's no aptness, I grant you, for learning,
And her memory oft seems to halt;
But, remember, if she's not accomplished.
It will certainly all be your fault.

worked as well as he knew how, and made a
comfortable living. One spring the postmaster
told him that if he would subscribe for an agri
cultural paper, read it carefully, and work ac
cording to instructions, that he would warrant
him to dear a thousand dollars that year. On
these conditions he paid for the paper, read it,
worked faithfully, and at the end of the year he
figured up carefully and found that he had
cleared $960. He sued the rascally postmaster
for the other forty, but by some dodge of the
law the villain cheated him out of it. Erer

torian tones, ""Cornal Macdonal', of coorte: I
kent him when he was Booking his mither!""
At another of the booths a respectable-looking
voter, evidently one of the newly-enfranchised
classes, and knowing nothing of election form
alities, advanced to the sheriff's table, when the
following colloquy ensued. Sheriff: ""Do yoa
wish to rote, sir?"" Voter: ""Yes."" Sheriff:
""What is your name?"" Voter: ""What's
yours ?"" Sheriff (after having got his name) :
"" Who do you vote for ?"" Voter (placing his
arms akimbo on the table, and, with a knowing
and familiar smile): "" Wha are ye for y'rsel' ?""
The Banner gives a thrilling account of an
accident which befel a lovely girl. She was
apparently the possessor of ""great wealth of
golden hair ;"" but while standing on the side
walk, chatting with some companions, this
""golden hair"" attracted the attention of a
hungry mule which was harnessed to a fruit
waggon near by. The vicious beast caught the
beautiful tresses between his teeth, and gave
them such a jerk as pulled them entirely out of
her head! The unfortunate girl was in a dis
tressed condition, but all attempts to rescue
the precious article from the wicked animal
were in vain—he was resolved to chew the choice
morsel to hia heart's content. The young lady
was conveyed home in a cab, and, at the last
accounts, hopes were entertained of her re
covery.",The Queenslander ,"686,522,96,663,633,534,473,620,553,749,641,505,568,650,607,609,717,548,716,607,516,509,655,706,656,619,569,622,719,706,581,685,721,687,540,754,864,102,866,211,865,327,859,682,860,904,902,904,911,478,866,907,902,904,905,905,142,854,905,904,902,910,909,431,865,909,899,905,902,901,507,863,906,905,904,901,904,906,175,838,906,903,906,905,905,905,506,863,904,904,905,904,904,888,904,117,860,906,908,904,904,906,904,907,549,858,907,908,907,906,907,906,907,358,863,905,902,905,907,906,905,906,904,816,861,907,890,905,905,907,909,914,906,815,860,907,907,908,907,907,905,907,906,907,749,864,908,906,906,907,907,891,890,907,908,904,907,907,907,907,907,907,885,866,891,907,890,909,908,906,907,890,909,910,905,911,909,909,907,907,863,908,914,889,909,908,894,905,900,910,888,907,908,907,903,908,895,131",Sat 13 Mar 1869,"260,435,1655,498,534,567,602,643,669,701,735,789,822,855,890,923,957,991,1025,1082,1115,1148,1183,1216,1250,1285,1318,1378,1413,1444,1479,1512,1546,1580,1614,1728,1772,1820,1860,1904,1948,1991,2035,2077,2123,2165,2211,2255,2301,2343,2389,2430,2476,2518,2564,2608,2652,2696,2739,2783,2830,2872,2918,2961,3006,3049,3094,3137,3183,3225,3269,3315,3359,3400,3446,3490,3534,3576,3619,3665,3709,3754,3800,3844,3888,3929,3972,4019,4061,4107,4150,4195,4239,4283,4328,4370,4416,4460,4504,4548,4594,4635,4682,4724,4767,4814,4855,4901,4946,4989,5033,5076,5120,5167,5211,5254,5301,5343,5387,5430,5474,5517,5561,5605,5650,5693,5739,5783,5825,5871,5915,5959,6003,6046,6093,6132,6181,6222,6268,6312,6353,6397,6443,6487,6529,6586,6628,6674,6710,6762,6805,6847,6890,6935,6980,7024,7066,7109,7153,7197,7243,7287,7334,7386,7431,7476,7520,7562,7606,7649,7693,7737,7781,7824,7868,7912,7956,7998,8044,8087,8132,8178,8220,8265,8309,8353,8395,8441,8482,8528,8573,8619,8661,8707,8750,8794,8835,8893","5980,6074,6655,5946,5976,5946,5976,5945,5978,5945,5978,5945,5980,5945,5980,5945,5978,5945,5978,5943,5978,5943,5978,5943,5976,5943,5976,5943,5975,5943,5975,5943,5973,5943,5975,5917,5917,5872,5915,5874,5915,5876,5915,5874,5918,5872,5871,5874,5871,5872,5915,5874,5874,5872,5872,5874,5871,5917,5871,5872,5871,5871,5872,5872,5915,5871,5871,5871,5871,5871,5871,5915,5872,5874,5874,5877,5874,5874,5874,5918,5874,5874,5872,5872,5872,5874,5874,5918,5874,5874,5874,5874,5874,5872,5874,5872,5917,5872,5872,5874,5874,5872,5874,5871,5871,5918,5871,5872,5871,5872,5871,5872,5872,5874,5917,5872,5869,5871,5871,5872,5872,5872,5874,5872,5917,5871,5871,5872,5874,5871,5871,5871,5871,5871,5913,5871,5871,5871,5871,5871,5871,5871,5871,5871,5871,5915,5871,5872,5872,5871,5872,5872,5872,5871,5871,5872,5871,5871,5871,5871,5871,5871,5872,5915,5871,5872,5871,5872,5872,5872,5874,5871,5872,5871,5874,5872,5872,5874,5874,5874,5918,5874,5872,5874,5874,5874,5871,5872,5874,5874,5877,5876,5876,5876,5876,5877,5871,5876",20323267,Page 3

A RECESSIONAL.
When wars and rumoure hold the land.
And Death reaps with unsparing hand,
When manifold temptations wait
To stay our footsteps' halting gait,
When kingdoms fall, and dangers press,
And knowledge fails, and eight grows less.
When all the earth resounds with strife,
Defend us, Lord of Death and Life.
Until the last farewell is said.
Until the sea gives up her dead,
And distant graves of veldt and stone,
Surrender what is not their own,
Until the dry boues of the plaiu
Awake at thy command again
To mystic power of living breath
Defend us, Lord of Life and Death.

TO AN INFANT, SLEEPING.
Rest, little one, rest, in thy holy sleep,
Dreaming of fairy things ;
Beautiful, placid, calm, and deep,
In Heaven's imaginings.
Sleep, little one, sleep, for all around
Thy tiny couch are still for thee ;
And hushed is each voice and slightest sound,
To preserve thy pure dream's ecstacy.
Like a cherub from high, reposing on earth,
Thou liest so guileless and fair ;
Whilst on thy young lips the smile of thy mirth
Makes me pray thy raptures to share.
Oh ! live in thy beauty, beloved and adored,
And ripen in virtue and bliss ;
May cares ne'er oppress thee, nor dangers accord,
And thy last sleep be quiet like this.

THERE'S a bleak, black world without,
And the rain falls fast;
And the wind, with a whine and a shout,
Blows buffeting past
To wail thro' the tortured trees,
With cold, wet breath,
Like a choir of dank banshees
Foretelling death.
I sit by the fire, and I nod,
And I juggle with rhymes.
Oh, the ways of our world grow odd,
And the trend of our times.
My tired eyes scan the news;
These columns tell
Of earth and its warring views,
And I sigh, ""Well, well!""
Idly I turn the page;
And I ponder then
Of hopes and the dreams and the rage
And the folly of men.
What profits this modern show?
And where do we gain?
But—twenty short years ago,
Ah, then we were sane!
Speed-drunk and pleasure crazed
We ravage and waste,
Dull, sentient things, half-dazed
By our own mad haste;
Selling content for gold,
Our peace for a fad.
Alas, for the wisdom of old!
We are mad! stark mad!
How, when, came earth's golden age—
If ever it shone?
Wise years of the saint and the sage,
These are goner—long gone,
Never to blossom again
'Mid a peace well-won,
In a world of the simply sane.
We are doomed! We are done!
When a score more years drift on,
Then another shall dwell
Here in my place, when I've gone,
And he'll sigh, ""Well, well!

THE NOMINATION.
I.
PARKESENNERY of Sydney
By the Empire paper swore
That Donaldson the Hamlets
Should represent no more;
By the Empire paper swore it
On the nomination day;
And bade his messengers run forth
East and west, and south and north,
To summon his array.
And east and west, and north and south,
His messengers ran fast,
And the back slums of Sydney
They summoned forth in haste;
Shame be on the false Bunchman
Who lingers in his home
When Parkesennery of Sydney
To the election bids him come.
III.
The horsemen and the footmen
Come pouring in amain;
And many a crowded omnibus,
Discharges upon the plain--
(The grassy plain of Redfern,
Still wet with morning dew)--
A mob of Sydney Bunchmen,
A noisy motley crew.
IV.
And now hath Sydney City
Sent forth her tale* of men;
The footmen are about fourscore,
The horsemen about ten.
Right opposite the hustings
Is met the great array;
And a proud man is Parkesennery,
On the nomination day.
For the bold Sydney Bunchmen
Were ranged beneath his eye,
And well he knew their stentor lungs
Would flinch not--howl or cry--
And with their yells, and groans, and cries,
Their cat-calls, and their shrieks,
He thought it quite impossible
That Donaldson could speak.
Then on the hustings stood Breillat,
As he had stood before,
And nominated Donaldson
To represent once more.
Out spake Breillat full roundly,
The Bunch must straight go down;
For if the Bunch should reign supreme,
God help our noble town.
VII.
And then outspoke one Lucas,
An elector big and strong,
And made a speech as forcible
As it was loud and long;
And little did he care for all
The Bunchmen's noise and fun,
But he crossed his arms on his broad chest,
And waited till they'd done.
And next came forth one Richardson,
Who in the Hamlet dwells;
But 'tis a pity that he left
The leather that he sells;
And loud he scouted Donaldson,
Without remorse or ruth;
But some thought it had beeen as well
If he had stuck to truth.
IX.
And then stood forth another man,
Whose name they say was Brown:
And he harangued the mob below,--
In language all his own.
He called himself a working man,
As doubtless was the case;
But he came in such a hurry,
He forgot to wash his face.
And then stood forth bold Donaldson,
To address the dark array:--
Free and enlightened citizens,
Full well I ween were they.
For what's the use of freedom,
If one may not howl and shriek,
And interrupt bold Donaldson
When he attempts to speak.
From these enlightened citizens
A storm of yells arose--
Such as one has not often heard,
Nor wished to hear,--God knows.
But bravely stood forth Donaldson,
Nor from the tumult shrunk,
Though fierce were those free citizens,
And some of them were drunk.
XII.
And boldly then did Donaldson
That motley crowd survey,
And said that they should hear him
If he waited there all day;
And oft he raised his manly voice.
And tried in vain to speak,
Amidst a storm of yells and groans,
And many a fiendish shriek.
XIII.
A proud man is Parkesennery
That nomination day;
As from the hustings he surveys
The Bunchmen's fierce array;
A proud man is Parkesennery
Well knowing as he stands,
His nominee is quite secure
To gain the show of hands.
And then stood forth John Campbell,
A man of small renown;
And on the mob of Bunchmen
He smilingly looked down;--
And hushed was the loud tumult,
For the Bunchmen knew that when
A Campbell speaks there something comes
That's worth the hearing then.
XV.
Then out spoke this John Campbell,
And told the mob below,
If they sent him to Parlament,
The whole hog he would go;
And then he paused and scratched his head
For sense that would not come;
For it -was somewhat evident
There was nobody at home.
He said he'd give away the land--
A mile to every man;
And do it cheaper even still
If he only knew the plan.
No matter whether Chinaman
Or savage from Lefoo,
He'd give them all the suffrage
And vote by ballot too.
XVII.
Then loudly cheered the Bunchmen,
Saying, ""You're the man for us;""
And then they broke the meeting up
And rushed to omnibus.
For doubtless they were hungry,
Being long past dinner time;
And homeward, too, I took my way
To tell the tale in rhyme.

Without corroding fear ;—

Beyond the pow'r of fate,
Her following days will always move
In one unclouded state.

To dream of cloudless skies —

And sound the wedding peal,

When tolls the fun'ral knell.

He didn't seem to grasp the idea, that married
man of Jaokson-stroot, who was very particular about
having his houso locked np securely at night jBomuoh
so as to incur the ridioulo of his wife, who often
deolarod that no burglar could frighten her. One
night, after a matrimonial discussion on the Bubjeot,
tho hnsband determined to test his spouse's courage,
and so about midnight he slid oat of bed, and, after
slipping on a long pair of whiskors ho had oonoealed
for the purpose, ho stole around to tho other Bide of
the bod and awoko his wife. Putting up her hand,
tho half-aroused woman tonohod tho property beard,
and whispered ; "" S-s-s-s-h ! How very imprudent
yon might wake the old pelican !"" The old pelican

Charity may bo a virtue, but when aiming to bo
good in this direction it is proper to Eee that gener-

gentleman, who is charitably disposed, has boen im-
posed upon BO many times he is now very oantiousto

with features pinched with cold, called at our f riond's
atoro and askod for something to eat. The morohont
was about to send him to tho right-about with a
savage "" No,"" when a something about the man's
face made him think that thia ono was possibly d.«
serving of oharity. Soho qneationod him, and drew ont
What appeared to bo a tolerably atraight story of mis-
fortune, resulting in tho loss of work, thus eompóllinfj
him to beg. "" Do you drink ?'' asked tho merohant,
"" No, sir !"" answorod the other, a little indignantly.
"" Do I look liko it ?"" The merohant was compelled
.to inwardly admit that his palo faoo did not look
like tho phiz of a drinking man. ""But,"" con-
tinued tho morohant, "" I supposo you would prefer a
tenponoa to a good warm breakfast?"" ''No, sir,""
replied the beggar j ""I would rather have the break-
fast."" This seemingly honest answor threw him
'off'hiB guard, and he handed him a quarter, tolling
him to go and get a breakfast. "" Thank you,"" said
tho fellow, as he oarefnlly laid away the ooin in an
inside pocket of his coat. ""Now, there bo men
mean enough to take money from a gentleman like
you and thon go off and poddle it out for rum. ' But
I ain't that kind of a ohap-not much. Good
day, air."" This little speech aroused the merchant's
suspicions, and ho told ono of his dorks to shadow
him and seo whore he brought np. Ho turned the
first corner, and there mot a companion, and as the
derk was following on behind, heard the following
dialogue :-"" Well, old rooster, what did you get?""
""Not a cent. How did you make out?"" ""Oh.Igot
a quartor. My total abstinence face did the business.
¡Your mm face spiles yon for a first-class beggar. But
come along in hero and got a drink,"" and the derk
saw them slide into a saloon, and when he wont back
and reported, tho merohant was convinced he had
j been sold again. If that total abstinonoo face shows
-up in that particular store again, there will be music
at tho toe of the merchant's boot.

Up. high with the windows; throw wide
every door;
There's a new thing about:
The blue, ol a pitiless sky is no more;
We have done with the drought.
The clods that were cracking with heat,
every one.
How they suck up the rain!
The plants in the garden, all wilted, un
done,
Tbcir heads uplift again.
The birds cut of sight are attuning their
throats,
Piping low, piping loud:
'Neath the eaves you can hear their sweet
satisfied notes;
Every tree has its crowd.
The breeze comes caressing and cool to the
face:

WHEN on dooty up at Ipswich, to'ards the middle
of last week
I received a Telly-gram, which thus to me did
speak:
""Hurry back with speedy 'aste, which I'm sorry
for to hurry yer,
But there's like to be a crisis 'twixt the Upper
'Ouse and 'Currier.' ""
""I 'ope you enj'yed yer visit, tho' brief has been
yer stay,
And that they've done the thing genteely, have
Quin and Kernel Gray;
Meet me promptly in the Lobby, when you returns
to town,
And believe me yers sincerely, William Ant'ny
Brown.""
Prompt I packed up my portmanty, and tuck it to
the boat,
Which the steamer was the ""Ipswich,"" the ugliest
boat afloat,
But the Capt'n he's a very brick, and that they all
diskiver,
Which travels up or down with him, upon the
Bremer River.
Away she quickly darted--soon disappears the
town,
And our noses soon do indikate, we're near the
""Biling Down,""
Where the Ipswich Cav'lry Captin, which his name
is Smith I think,
Stood stirring of his tallow pots, and making of a
stink.
The day was fine, the sun did shine, the water
wasn't rough,
Soft blew the breeze, past flew the trees, and the
mansion of De Muff,
Oh many sweet and nice things, upon the way we
saw,
Until the wharf at Brisbane, alongside we did
draw.
I 'astened to the Upper 'Ouse, as quickly as I
could,
And as I entered, heard the voice of Mister Western
Wood,
Which in oriental langwidge, peculiarly his'n,
Was persuadin' of the 'Ouse to send the 'Currier's'
Ed. to pris'n.
But I mustn't tell what past--mums the word--
""no fears""--
For its wery wicked treason, to redicule the Peers.
Besides it's not a fitting subjeck, for poetic
elocution,
And might bring me to be j'ined in the 'Currier's'
persecution.
But if I mayn't be disrespectful, it is no harm to
praise,
So in praise of 'on'ble members, my 'umble vice I'll
raise;
And my verses, one and all, with praises shall be
shod,
Of the President, and Members, not forgetting the
Black Rod.
Which the last's a digniterry, of horful mien and
look,
He'd make a splendid picter, if he'd have his
likeness took;
But with his rod and sable garments, it puzzles
the observant,
To tell if he's a butler, or a sort of upper servant.
Compigne is a trump, he is, if not the best
logician;
M'Dougal is of nothing worth, as an arithmetician;
M'Connell seems to think it hard, he's got to leave
his station;
And 'Arris looks most wondrous wise, though lost
in botheration.
But the pick of all the 'ouse is Lawer Dan, yer sees,
Which he's got some little nouse, and presides o'er
committees;
Burley Balfour he's a mason, and been branded
with hot irons,
So he 'sociates real property with equitable lions.
Old Yaldwyn is a jovial blade, an honest hearty
sinner,
""All there"" he is at making love, or enj'ying a
good dinner;
A gentleman 'mongst gentlemen, a nob amongst
the nobs,
And 'nointed well with dugong ile, is wily Doctor
Hobbs.
But a sudden call of dooty, compels me here to
stop,
And until a future period, the subjeck to let drop;
Up again I'll pick it, when there's no other fish
to fry,
And so no more at present, from yours truly,

Amor Anni
IN ENGLAND.
D.B.W. SLADEN.
IN baby January
I met a little fairy;
Halfway in February
I wooed—her name was Mary.
In March she was arch,
In April grew tender,
In May dawned the day,
In June the full splendour
Of a woman's love
Filled our common heaven;
In July it throve,
August saw its even ;
One September night,
Starlit, it fell sober;
Even that poor light
Flickered in October.
Rheumatic old November
Quenched its last smould'ring ember,

FOR THE WHOLE OF THE YEAR 1831.
TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR,
CAPTAIN-GENERAL.
The following One for the Year 1831,
IS MOST HUMBLY INSCRIBED,
By his most dutiful and obedient Servant,
HENRY WRENSFORD.
Kirkham, January 1, 1831.
See Stella, see his ruddy face!
The New Year comes with regal pace,
And mounts his torrid throne;
See how he shakes his visage more,
With golden rev'rence mantl'd o'er,
And blessings round him thrown.
The youthful Spring, gay sprightly Maid,
With eye reluming robes array'd
Resigns her vernal pride;
Now more, soft melting, as they stay
The fragrant balmy Zephyr's play,
Bright Sol must now preside.
Hail! bounteous Year of Thirty one!
Welcome, thrice welcome, be they Sun,
Thy gifts I grateful sing;
Join hear and tongue to bless the Day,
My muse inspire the sacred la?,
To hail Great WILLIAM KING!
The joys transported wait around,
And music breathes her softest sound,
If Stella's presence cheer;
Late, where we till'd the fruitful soil,
See now rich harvest crowns our toil,
To bless the op-ning Year.
See our infant Commerce fly
Around the Globe with searching eye,
And own the fostering care
OF HIM who, spite of faction's tongue,
Paternal shall our joys prolong,
Whilst we his name revere!
Yes, there's a few,—a faithful Band,—
Who dare, with honest front to stand
Against the ingrate shout!
The creatures of mild Mercy's hand,
The blast and mildew of the land,
a wretched rabble rout!
Enough of this unpleasing theme,
Let smiling Hope illume the scene,
And future prospects raise;
Let Jocund sounds salute the morn,
And rosy bloom the hills adorn,
All emulate to praise!
Long may the wreath of health entwine
Around thy brows its clustered vine,
In dignity serene;
Long may thy progeny extend
The sacred name of Father, Friend,
To ages yet unseen!
In conscious rectitude and peace (!)
Thou shalt behold the Monarch's face,
In Virtue's armour clad!
His gracious smile on thee will shine,
Reflect the self-approving sign,
AND DRIVE THY FOEMEN MAD!

The cases of the various receivers of stolen
goods occupied the greater part of Tuesday,
at the Police office; the examinations were
conducted in the private room.
Complaints are making of the difficulty
which respectable Householders, as well as
un-respectable ones, experience, in obtaining
female servants from the Factory, lately, al-
though there are eight hundred at present
confined there. (N.B. We are told that
the Committee are annoyed at the treatment
the female Convicts receive from Household-
ers in Sydney. Some send for them to make
prostitutes of them. Others send for them
that cannot afford to board, lodge and clothe
them decently. And others who are respec-
table and in good circumstance from caprice
and a tyrannical disposition, change their ser-
vants so often as to put the Government to great
expense. There are the circumstances we un-
derstand which put the Committee to a stand-
still. Nevertheless, 800 women are an enor-
mous number for the Crown to maintain, and
we should think that the whimsicalities of
their employers is to be excused on account
of the utter worthlessness, in general, of these
persons—we mean the female convicts of New
South Wales. We have employed them for
twenty years, and they get worse rather than
better. ED.)
The good folks of Windsor still com-
plain of the very dilapidated state in which
Howe's Bridge is allowed to remain, not-
withstanding every time they pass the
temporary one with a dray or chaise, eight
pence is demanded, and then they run a
risk of drowning or a good ducking at the
very lest; had the circuits been conti-
nued, we have no doubt this would have
been remedied long ere this. But Grand
Juries are wanted to put such things to
rights.
The system of rewards and punishments
adopted by Captain Clunie at Moreton
Bay, they say gives general satisfaction
to all classes of persons on the establish-
ment, which is now in a quiet state, prov-
ing that the continual and severe floggings
of Captain Logan were superfluous.
Chalker being in custody, the fight be-
tween him and Morgan the black, is post-
poned, but Kable has challenged him for
the honour of Australia, and the fight will
take place on an early day.
A large quantity of plunder, which our
readers may remember was stolen from a
dray belonging to Mr. McQuade, has at
last, through the information of Walmsley
and Webber, been discovered, stowed
away in a hollow tree; but unfortunately
the information came to late, as the grea-
ter part of the goods are damaged.
His Majesty's Attorney General having
resigned his Commission on Sunday last,
the Criminal side of the Supreme Court is
closed for the present.
Captain Rossi took up his old berth at
the Police Office on Tuesday, after his re-
turn from sheep shearing. He appears in
""rude health,"" and from the pleasing ro-
tundity which now distinguishes his person,
we should surmise, that during his absence
he has been living on wild ducks, silver eels,
and last but not least, maize-fed pork.

gages carrying the paltry interest of 15 per

TO C. H.
I would sit at your feet for long days
To hear the sweet Muse of the Wild
Speak out through the sad and the passionate lays
Of her first, and her favourite child.
I would sit at your feet, for my soul
Delights in the solitudes free ;
And I stand where the creeks and the cataracts roll,
Whenever I listen to thee !
I would sit at your feet, for I love
By the gulches and torrents to roam ;
And I long, in this city, for woodland and grove,
And the peace of a wild forest home !
I would sit at your feet, and we'd dwell
On the scenes of a long-vanished time ;
While your thoughts into music would surge and would
swell,

I would sit at your feet, for I know,
Though the World in the Present be blind,
That the amaranth blossoms of Promise will blow
When the Ages have left you behind !

That ever will own you, and hold you their Chief,
And a monarch of Song in the land !

Brisbane, 11th May, 1805.
FAREWELL, dear Lady! Bright the hour
That brought you; sad that bears away;
Yet—English fields are all a-flower,
And English hedgerows sweet with May;
Love there as here shall be your dower—
'Tis not for us to bid you stay.
Farewell ! Oh not alone the few
Familiar friends will miss you here
How excellent soe'er the New
Be slow to place another peer
To her whom now they bid adieu—
Of all Vice-Queens the one most dear !
Your helpful care the couch has spread
For suffering babes; angelic toil !
On wounds of women shamed you shed
Samarian balm of wine and oil;
As Sister, with the scorned broke bread—
You, with white raiment free from soil!
And women-hands that toil your hand
Has touched and strengthened. Mothers tell
Of the sweet Presence, come to stand
By the new-born, where poor folk dwell,
With generous gifts. Throughout the Land
Is none but grieves to say Farewell.
Farewell, dear Lady All good things
Be yours the All-Giver may bestow.
Its folds abroad the Ensign flings;
The sea-tide swells the river-flow;
The parting cheer around you rings;
Farewell!

Ah! to be out where the sun sets,
Fire red, in a flaming arc,
Flushing the paling horizon,
Challenging the coming dark.
To pause when the evening's soothing
A spent day into a swoon,
Lulled by an ethereal whisp'ring,
Like a hushing mother's croon!
Where a pure, sweet bedtime 6tory
Tunes in with the night's soft
balm,
When somewhere a horse bell's tinkle
Floats lisht on a restful calm.
And. oh, while a moon rides, bridging
Wide gaps in a white patched
screen,
What peace to lie tracing her back
ground
Of jewelled velveteen!
What joy to tramp while the last
stars
Flash out in the rushing dawn,'.
How free to be there, unwanted
By a world soul squeezed in pawn;
Phrasing a paean to the sunrise,
Thinking of work-dull slaveE,
And vague ideas of freedom,
They chant in their routine graves!
Afar, where the miles lead northward,
What peace in the brooding noon
To dine to the wild bush music,
Dose off in a dreamy swoon!
Aud then in the lull of evening,
When camped, what sweet content
While slaves are being evicted
For a strange thing known as rent!
Wide is the world to the westward,
North is a free man's land.
Time is a bagman's riches,
To squander with lavish hand.
Smoke stacks stand to the eastward.

whine.
Me for the long lead regions,
'Where all that 1 see is mine.

TO THE MEMORY
OF
ROBERT WARDELL, ESQ. L. L. D.
Who was barbarously Murdered on the afternoon of
SUNDAY SBPTEMBER 7th, 1834.
FAIR as this Morn—bright as this Morning's Sun
Were those one week ago—the Sky its crimson glow
Spread forth as it does now—and lo ! thy course is run,
And thou art laid, midst great and lowly, low.
Ah ! was that crimson blush that Heaven o'erspread
The harbinger of Blood—to summon to the Dead
Unhappy Man ! thyself !—No hand to save,
Thou, mighty Spirit ! prostrate in thy Grave
Dost lie.—Peace to thy Ashes, then,—no power,
No prayer can now avert thy Doom.—
Tho' thus my Tears I pour upon thy Tomb ;
No Friend, no Kindred soothed thy dying hour,
Cut off by cruel hand in Manhood's bloom,
Thou flourishedst, and passedst as a summer shower.

MINISTRY.
[Fiom the Port Darwin' Debating and
Literary Societies Manuscript Magazine,
January 2Gth, 1894.]
Here lies poor Macdouald as straight as a
gun.
No more his political show will be ruir;
No more will he blacken those landholders'
eyes,
And teach his blind country the way to be
wise.
His harp of one string on the willow is
"" hung,
His land bill unhatched and his honour
unsung.
It's here 'neath this stone where poor
Williams "" sits down.""
He was trusty and true, though tanned a
bit biown.
His fall was to him so much of a shocker
It stiffened him out as straight as a knocker.
The crow of his rooster that comes to his
door,
To his task in the shop will wake him no
more.
His loud-somuling anvil stands silent and
lone ;
His hammer's unlifted : his bellows unblown:
His fires are gone out and his ashes are
cold ;
And six feet of earth on his bosom is rolled.
Had he only survived his last fatal day,
He would have been older, and possibly
may
Have regained his lost seat and rose to a
peer.
And therefore would not have been "" sittiug
down"" here.
Of March flies we've heard, but here lies a
March-ant ;
His vigour was great, though his stature
was scant.
His aim was to be a political leader,
But nature designed him to be a man
feeder,
So when he came here fresh from life's
heated battle,
He knew less of men than he did about
cattle.
Here Adcock reclines beneath this old
willow :
A volume of ""Hansard"" serves him for a
pillow ;
He decided by it on every occasion,
And promptly sat on each wanton evasion.
Still, members brought forth some very wild
notions,
And could not, or would not, speak to their
motions, ,
This tried him while in the chair of the
Speaker,
So that, since, his hold on life has been
weaker.
The Opposition, too, was a thorn in his
side
Their foolish self-seeking, presumption, and
pride.
So that, troin causes many and various
His health has been for some time precarious.
No wonder that he, when his feet began
slipping
From the throne of his power, should find
his eyes dripping
With the wilful tears that would steal from
their lashes
At thought of the six Ministerial crashes.
Hdd he remained in his mercantile world,
From that Treasury Bench he ne'er had
been hurled,
Nor would he be lying beneath this old
willow
With a volume of "" Hansard"" to serve as his
pillow.
Since his fall from the House here Ellis has
rested,
A man of good parts, who passed nothing
untested ;
So, when he was there, he sat in his chair,
Aud everything measured by line and by
square.
Of gentlest bearing, he never would snub
us,
And yet he was always ready to "" club"" us.
Here Riddell retires at the close of his day :
Though youthful, with worry his head has
turned grey.
He had a good memory-as clear as a
crystal
With a voice that was not as true as a
pistol ;
Which shot its sound down when it should
have been raised,
And loudly condemned where it ought to
have praised.
The bent of his mind, like a typical ferret
(And this, by the way, was his principal
merit)
Sought out facts to drag to justice laud
schemers,
To flash his new light in the eyes of old
dreamers ;
Besides, he always maintained his defences
By trying to startle us out of our senses
By a tremendous din and a clatter,
When anything extra great was the matter.
Still, some of his facts were very enriching,
And some of his figures very bewitching.
He had his friends, and many a troublesome
elf:
But the foe that afflicted him most was
himself.",Northern Territory Times and Gazette ,"654,253,861,794,406,865,82,766,864,95,865,95,862,129,863,149,866,447,864,200,785,859,864,98,863,108,865,105,861,865,106,859,774,863,80,863,93,867,238,862,229,863,201,708,848,130,865,268,864,124,863,152,865,147,690,837,866,154,865,670,866,167,862,151,864,75,864,112,763,860,864,156,865,324,856,221,822,819,862,236,867,129,861,131,864,129,865,189,818,861,140,864,53,859,863,862,239,862,134,863,134,864,330,866,263,823,866,119,866,187,866,201,842,779,680,858,862,796,867,72,867,151",Fri 9 Feb 1894,"425,471,568,611,656,732,787,819,861,917,947,992,1034,1079,1118,1176,1273,1316,1360,1404,1446,1489,1533,1578,1619,1674,1705,1750,1792,1836,1880,1921,1967,2009,2065,2097,2152,2184,2229,2332,2377,2419,2468,2506,2550,2595,2637,2681,2724,2767,2870,2915,2956,3001,3043,3087,3128,3174,3215,3258,3302,3345,3387,3433,3475,3518,3562,3606,3650,3694,3737,3782,3825,3869,3913,3957,4000,4045,4087,4132,4175,4220,4264,4308,4411,4455,4498,4544,4585,4630,4684,4716,4769,4800,4902,4946,4989,5032,5075,5119,5162,5202,5248,5291,5334,5377,5421,5469,5510,5556,5597,5644,5685,5730,5774,5818,5862,5905,5949,5993,6036,6080","5127,5324,5019,5085,5080,5016,5187,5016,5015,5185,5014,5186,5013,5164,5014,5184,5011,5186,5012,5184,5011,5011,5011,5183,5013,5182,5011,5183,5015,5012,5184,5014,5013,5015,5187,5014,5186,5013,5187,5017,5187,5016,5188,5016,5016,5186,5015,5189,5017,5187,5016,5189,5015,5186,5015,5015,5014,5187,5015,5187,5015,5187,5017,5187,5017,5187,5016,5188,5015,5016,5015,5186,5015,5188,5018,5187,5014,5015,5017,5189,5014,5187,5018,5186,5015,5186,5014,5188,5014,5014,5185,5013,5186,5015,5014,5013,5184,5014,5182,5013,5181,5012,5184,5009,5182,5011,5010,5182,5009,5182,5010,5181,5013,5010,5010,5015,5011,5010,5010,5183,5011,5183",3326131,Page 3

meals regularly: do not dine at 2 p.m. to-day,
and 7 p.m. to-morrow, and 4 p.m. the day after)
bat fix tome stated hour} and, for the
workers, I should My that from 6 to half-past 6
v a good and serviceable hoar. Dining late is,
as a rule, preferable to mid-day dinners, for
dinner ooght to be the principal meal of the
day, and, to be enjoyed a* well as digested,
admits of neither harry nor interference. The
work of the day shonld be over; and a long
rest, followed by light occupation before bed
time, will be singularly conducive to health as
well as happiness. If you are to ignore the art
of dining, you may as well repudiate at once the
art of living and working, for rest assured that,
unless you dine with judgment; you will not be
able to calculate with foresight; and, just for
the lac| of a little gastronomical knowledge, you
may be a bankrupt. Is there not the old story
quoted by everybody who baa written on food
and digestion—namely, that the first Napoleon
lost the battle of Leipsic from eating a badly
cooked mutton chop? He died of eanoer of
the stomach. I do not say that this was
brought on by hit hastily-snatched, half-masti
cated cutlets and chickens» but if we allow
that a man has a predisposition to malignant
disease, is it unlikely that the most ill-treated
organ should be attacked by the disease P Be
careful as to the character of your food—your
imports let us call them i let them be nourish*
ing, digestible, and judiciously cooked j for if
these three qualities are combined, you will
include a fourth—namely, that they shall be
palatable. It is easy enough to tell you what is
nourishing; those household words, beef and
mutton, imply a multitude of dishes that shall
nobly support life, and rarely fail to please the
palate. Possibly you may reply, ""That's
notbiug new t anybody could have told us to eat
beef and mutton i »c have been eating it all
our lives."" True, jou have done so, but as un
conscious of it* merits as te bourgeois gentU*
homme was of his conversation being prose
"" Five la prose ! il y a quaranU an* que je
parle la prose."" It may be that you hare been
eating beef for forty years, fad yet you may be
even now profoundly ignorant of its full merits
and capabilities. You bare not always eaten it
with judgment; you have eaten it tough,
perhaps, or with the juioes of the meat ex*
traded, or with greasy accessories that do not

There v a general idea prevalent that all beef is
pretty much of a muchness, more often tough
than tender, instilling us with the belief that •
bullock is an animal possessed of ribs which
admit of mysterious rolling, and of a part which
is liberal enough to supply us with steaks for
the usual accessories of onions or oysters. But
remember, il y a de* pommes et de* pommes,

The Old Woman nr thb WofiKSOuai. —It
was while walking down a dismal ward—the
ward appropriated to bedriddoa inmates—that
our attention was arrested by a very old woman,
lying flat on her back, and looking drearily
round the room and up to the whitewashed
ceiling with a pair of fine melancholy blue
eyes, those eyes which yet preserve their youth
when the other features are withered up with
time. On being asked if she would not like to
read | ""Yes ma'am,"" she said, ""if I had any
spectacles."" So for want of spectacles this old
woman was allowed to lie doing absolutely
nothing from month to month. We sat down
and began to talk to her. She had been a
' household servant in LadyBBee family •
had married, and had lived till lately with an
old husband, long paralytic. Then he died.
We asked her how they got on in their age and
weakness. "" I kep htm,"" says the old woman j
her blue eyes flashed with a fierce, wifely fire,
as though she said, ""do you suppose I would
let him come here ?"" Then we heard a long
story told with minute garrulity • how the old
husband died, and she went on living by herself
in her little room, doing such small chars as
might keep her few wants supplied} till one
evening, after tea, she mounted on a ohair, and
tried to lift the tray covered with tea things on
an upper shelf, and overbalancing, fell, ohair,
tray, and frail old human body; and they
brought her to the workhouse with a broken
bone, and at seventy-seven she would never
rise again. Already she had been there
eighteen months, gazing up at the
workhouse ceiling, without spectacles and
without books—this respectable household
servant of Lady Be. We asked if she
would like something to read. ""Oh!""
said the old woman eagerly. ""And what
books?"" ""I was a Catholic"" said the old
woman, with a contrite pathos quite inde
scribable. The next day she had a pair of
strong spectacles, and a volume of Father
Faber's hymns, and the expression in those old
blue eyes will never be forgotten to the giver's
dying day. Since then the workhouse cripple
has gone to her tttt.—Englishwoman's Journal.
Pbbkatubi Adtkotssmbhtb. —One is get
ting used to the piling up of names in matrimo
nial advertisements. When Mr Brown has the
felicity of marrying Miss Jones, the announce
ment of the fact is pretty certain to include the
names of father, grandfather, and any titled rela
tives of the bridegroom and the bride, and
those of all the clergymen officiant or assistant,
with all such other details of pedigree or sta
tion as may be deemed attractive to the public
eye. Of late this custom has extended, in some
cases we hare noticed, from the marriages to
the births, and there have been protruded an
nouncements such as this: —"" On the 11th in
stant, at Amelia Augusta, wife of Timothy
Twaddle, Esq., /.P., F.UJZ 8., &0., to., of a
son [Augustus Timothy]."" Now, Mrs. Chrundy,
please ma'am, what imports the nomination of
this infant? Clearly the little bantling was not
born ready-christened; and viewing the celerity
with which his birth has been announced, it is
hardly likely that he has been yet presented at
the font. I'he proclamation of tne Christian
names which are to be applied to him must be
therefore premature, and of nominal impor
tance. Friends at a distance, who might be ex
pected to accept the intimation, and to express
congratulation, or, if cynical, condolence, could
hardly be expected to recite the welcome little
stranger's names in their letters to his parents,
and say they hoped to hear that Master Timothy
Augustus was in tolerable health. For months
that little gentleman will be called baby by his
nurse, and probably addressed by his Mamma
as a "" pooty dueksy wucksy,"" or a "" tiddy iokle

And dusters of tiniest grapes ashine

Such starlight purples and moonlight

""Beachcomber:"" They guard their wireless
telegraphy apparatus aboard warships in Syd
ney harbour most carefully. 1 was on board a
cruiser in Farm Cove recently, and though
somewhat accustomed to strange noises pecu
liar to such craft, I was much disturbed In
mind and nerve on account of a clattering and a
banging which was wafted from the half-deck
one day. Clatter-bang-clash it went. I in
quired of my friend and guide. ""Oh, that's the
wireless telegraph machine, don't you know,""
he said. I didn't know, and tried to find out,
but was informed that the operating-room was
one of the spots that visitors must avoid. Nev
ertheless, I ascertained later that not very long
ago a cruiser was coming down the-coast from
the north and hadn't ""tuned"" up the machine.
Result rather amusing. Another cruiser was
trying to ""speak with her,"" and the operator
kept on asking ""Indicate your position."" No
answer came for hours, but at last he must have
struck the right chord, for the reply was ""eth
ered"" thus:-""At so-and-so buoy In Farm Cove.""
The other chap thought the ship was in the
vicinity of Newcastle.

""X. O.:"" Tributing has\a risky as well as a
financial side. A rich mine that has reached
the worked-out stage is where tributers take
risks. One form of tributing is ""running the
Stulls."" In working a reef of moderate size a
certain amount of mullock is shot out to make
working room. The method of disposing of
this mullock is to throw it down behind against
timbers erected to form a barrier over the level
from which the reef is being worked. These
timbers are known as Stull props, and the
Stulls are the packed up mullock behind the
stopes. In older times, when an ounce, or
even two ounces, to the ton didn't pay much,
small and then inferior pay stuff found its way
into the stulls, and it is after this pay stuff
the stull-running trlbuter goes. Just conceive
a subterranean chamber 100ft in length and
breadth, and anything from 4ft upwrds In
height. The chamber runs up at an angle of
say, 45deg or over. Its contents are a mass of
rubble and boulders, and timber. The timber
has been there for ten or fifteen years, and
much of it has rotted, or has been split or
crushed to fragments owing to the hang
ing-wall (the roof of the stopes) coming
down. Tributers will pay a proportion
of the gold won for the right to
loosen-out, ""run,"" the contents of this semi
vortlcal chamber. At times it may be neces
sary to go up and put a shot in to loosen the
debris; at others the rubble and boulders come
with a rush, blocking up the level for many
yards, and supplying a good week's trucking.
? The only thing above ground writer has seen
to compare with a rush of mullock when ""run
ning stulls"" ls a seven-storey wall that crash
ed out into the street during a big Are. With
every fall clouds of dust rise, and the labour of
trucking ls arduous. And all for-perhaps a
net result of 10s a week-perhaps ten times
as much. Life and limb are big stakes to play
against such paltry winnings.

RINGS OF BLUE.
In easy chair my father sits,
And Nell is at his knee,
While mother clears the things away
And tidies after tea;
And little Jack, the daddy's pet,
Runs quickly from the room
To pluck a cleaner for the pipe
From mother's kitchen broom.
The lamp is held, the cloth is on--
'The circle is complete,
With ""Jockey Jack"" on father's knee,
And Nell at mother's feet.
""Some rings,"" we cry, ""some pretty rings,
Please, dear old daddy, do;
Just like you made the other night,
Some pretty rings of blue.""
And father, bless his kindly heart,
To please the merry school,
Puffs loud and fast to gather steam,
Then takes a mighty pull,
And makes a funny ""button"" mouth,
And softly whispers ""Woo!""
As, forth on fairy wings, they fly,
Those pretty rings of blue.
And how we shout and dance in glee,
And chase them round the chair
Out past the lamp to wear them all,
As bangles of the air.
And happy, too, is he, the king
Of all our hearts so true;
When seated in his easy chair,
He blows the rings 0f blue.

""Oliver:"" I remember some months ago read
ing in ""T. and C."" how the city professional
cyclist and the country travelling cyclist are
paid. The former wins a race. As the re
sult of a mile spurt he nets anything up to
a hundred pounds, and is a little tin god. The
other pushes his machine all over the conti
nent, either on business or looking for work.
Nature has been rather bounteous in placing
(literally) thorns in the path of the.buBh cy
clist. I have cycled in Queensland and the
bindeii is a pest. I have cycled all over New
South Wales, and the ""Bogan flea"" and vari
ous cacti are met with. In Victoria box thorn
hedges are numerous, and I have on more than
one occasion walked five or six miles. Here in
West Australia sand and ""double G."" are the
cyclist's horrors. Have just walked five miles
into Geraldton, result of a puncture. ""Double
G.'s"" are small seeds about a quarter of an inch
long; and with three very sharp and strong
thorns. They possess the merit, or demerit, of
always having one thorn pointing heavenward,
no matter how it is thrown on the ground. An
ingenious squatter in the very early days Im
ported the ""double G."" from the Cape, and he
sowed it all round his homestead, in order to
keep the blacks away. This is the Scots and
the Danes over again, and as the thistle has
spread so has the ""double G.,' and now lt is
spreading all over W.A. But the sand is the
cyclist's nightmare. I biked about 160 miles
last week, but carried the bike on my back for
miles and miles.

""E. P.:"" It is a pity that somebody with
money, leisure, and a taste for archaeological
research does not make an effort to solve the
origin of the mysterious rock paintings in the
north-west portion of this, continent. Any
body who glances at Australian history knows
that they were first discovered by Sir George
Grey in 1838. Ever since then they have ex
cited the wonder and curiosity of both scien
tific and unscientific people, but all have failed
alike, to And a plausible explanation as to how
the naked nomads of this secluded corner of
the continent came to be acquainted with the
sleeved garments of civilisation. In 1901, the
spot was again revisited, and some photo

1837-39.)
graphs taken of these remarkable paintings.
Grey's copies are evidently slightly idealised,
the fault of memory, doubtless; and aro far
more symmetrically designed than the repre
sentations of the too faithful camera; but in
essence they are the same. The trite explan
ation is, of course, that Chinese or Malays have
at some forgotten time landed on the north
coaBt or been shipwrecked tb are. Thence
the inspiration. But this in no way cKplp.'n'j
all the details. The halos or turbans r >unJ
the heads are as strange aB the fact that the
figures are all oyekss. These paintings are
strictly local, and apparently have not spread
beyond tho Immediate district where was first
drawn the original painting, from which those
copies have been made. If the original could
bo found, we ought not to have much trouble
in deciding as to whose work lt was-Asiatic
or European. These paintings are generally
drawn in sheltered spots, and regarded with
somo degreo of veneration by the natives; at
least, as much veneration as one can beliove
the Australian native capable of. The situ
ation reminds one of a shrine to somo saint,
or even the Madonna. This, together with the
halo and robe, ls very suggestive of a medioval
picture. Perhaps some monk of the fifteenth
century cast away during the voyage to the
Philippines, found here a final home, and spent
his years of exile in trying to convert the
heathen by means of the rude arts of those
times, chief amongst which was the use of
holy pictures, etc. His savage pupils after
wards tried to perpetuate his original doslgn
by oopieB, mixed with a little of their own
art. The colours UBed are, according to Mr.
Brockman, the surveyor, who rediscovered and
photographed the paintings, durable, and when
sheltered aro weatherproof. The district
where tho rock paintings oxlst, at least these
particular onos, ls not large, but rough; and
at present, unsettled; so that a vory caroful
search, coupled with tho assistance of the
natives, might reveal the fact of a landing on
Australia a hundred years bofore Commander
Willem Jams, of the Duyfken, paid us a visit.

SONG.
THE SEAMAN'S ADIEU.
---
I.
ADIEU--adieu, my dearest,
My barque is in the bay,
And the cannon that thou hearest,
Forbids my longer stay.
II.
My sails aro loos'd on high, love--
My anchor is a-peak
My pennant fills the sky, love,
Yet a tear is on thy cheek.
III.
Oh! do not--do not weep, love,
The whirlwinds of the sea
Will slumber while I sleep, love,
With joyous dreams of thee!
IV.
To burning climes I roam, love
But wherever I may roam,
My heart still doats on home, love,
My hallow'd hearth and home,
V.
Our cottage by the mountain,
Our garden and each tree,
Our grotto and its fountain,
Have a thousand charms to me.
VI.
But dearer--dearer far, love.
Than May-bud to the bee,
Than to the moth the star, love,
Art thou, fond girl, to me.
VII.
Then cease to weep, my dearest,
Nor grieve because we part,
The danger which thou fearest
Brings rapture to my heart.
VIII.
'Tis joy to cleave the billow,
With more than falcon speed,
With my ""light barque"" for my pillow,
My castle, and my steed.
IX.
Adieu--adieu, my kind one,
Again--again, adieu--
Tho' I roam I ne'er shall find one
So loved, so fond as you.

I CAN build another fire, if the fire goes out;
I can find another watercourse, if this runs dry;
I can always make a damper if 1 have a little flour;
I can alwavs find a Darrot or a pigeon for a pie.

S.G. MEE.
ALL nature faints this weary noon;
Shrill as the sound before a swoon,
Rings out the locusts dizzy tune.
Hither, my dog! we now are free;
Our flock is circling'neath yon tree;
And this our noonday Rest shall be.
What! thy fond paw upon my breast!
Well, well—thou lov'st me!—let it rest:
With such affection all were blest!
And shall such Feeilng unpass'd be,
O friend, so faithful and so free ?—
Thy heart's pulsations all for me !
Not so:—Thy kindly eye doth move
An artless song, though mean it prove:
Few lines are lasting as thy love!
Thine was no lot 'midst wealth or state ;
Nor would thou it had been thy fate
To bark beside some lordly gate.
A bushman, on a sorry hack;
A wight whose wealth's slung at his back;
Such men will ne'er thy friendship lack.
With voice clear as a dinner-bell,
Thou wagg'st the wand'rer to our cell;
Saint Bernard, sure, had lov'd thee well!
Nor be thy shepherd-skill unsung:
A swifter foot or merrier tongue
Never o'er mountain raced or rung.
Like barques smooth-gliding o'er a sea;
Beeming apart as stars to be;
Yon host of gleaming fleeces see!
""Forward!"" From hill and mountain brow
Converging, fly they from him now,
Like billows from a vessel's prow.
Yet not from fear:—yon ""ration"" wright
Tosses his buttocks in his flight
With a contemptuous delight:
Stops—looks around him with disdain ;
Regards with scorn the flying train ;
Bobs, pirouettes—then off again!
Ah mind I well the doleful day
He led (no doubt with spirits gay)
That poor misguided mob away
Allured them o'er the mountain-pass
To find, beyond that dank morass,
An El Dorado of "" burnt grass!""
O silly race of selfish rams
Saw I, in dreams, your bleeding dams;
Behold ye, lacerated lambs!
Scarce climb the sun the mountain's side,
Again that rueful yard I eyed;
I called thee then—no voice replied!
"" Thou recreant too!"" ah woe was me!
Three hawks flew from a distant tree;
And th' wild dogs howled, dismally.
(Yet no upbraidings did impend,
However now my search might end,
From him —the luckless shepherd's friend).
With weary heart, and wearier feet,
Far, far beyond th' custom'd beat,
I traced when,lo! I heard a bleat!
Saw something whits afar!—"" a log ""
A dwarf bush gleaming 'midst the fog!""—
Ha! ha!—My own!—my gallant dog!
Thy graceful tail I might espy,
Waving like warrior's plume on high!
And rang thy bark full merrily:
And there the rebel lambkins lay,
Shimmering in the morning's spray,
Like nebula in a Milky Way
The red-coat dingoes full in sight! -
Else many a ewe had been unblest;
Lambs vainly many an odder prest;
And th' world lost many a coat and vest.
Brave sentinel! thy matchless skill
Shall shine in unborn tailor's bill:
Thy doughty deeds a tome would fill!
Thy ""instinct"" is a tome to me;
And oft I wonder, wherefore we
Ignore thy immortality :
For I thy love, so changeless, scan;
Find I its counterpart in man ?
Truth cannot; fiction scarcely can.
There as I hold thy paw and read,
I from a spacious world secede,
And love, at least, the Indian's creed.
But, see! yon circle spreads away;
Come - ever ready at thy play!—
I'll tell of thee some future day.

Though with his laurels we have twined the yew,
Immortal is the noble mind and true
Whose words, heart-warm, still thrill the spirit through;
The thought intense, the ringing tones and strong,
Upholding righteousness, unveiling wrong,
Uttered to raise the level of the throng.
"" Of all her children fully justified
Is Wisdom;""—bravely in high place he cried,
And none (the Past remembering) denied ;—

I^HE silver clouds of summer time
x Go sailing out to-day
As perfect as a perfect rhyme,
In balanced flight they sway
Slowly across an infinite blue bay.
Seeking a pearly haven on
The far horizon's lee,
Serenely on to Avalon,
Or golden Arcady,
Some perilous port of faery gramarye.
Unlike the ships that, up and down,
Must follow through the foam,
The long sea miles to London Town,
Tlie many roads to Rome,
They trust no anchored star to steer
them home.
They leave no watery path or wake
Behind their sagging rails,
No snowy foam-bells suige and break
Where each blunt bow assails
The unfathomed blueness of those
skyey trails.
Oh, toppling galleons of cloud,
It surely seems to me
You sail beneath, each stately proud
Adventurous Argosy,
Sealed orders, to be opened out at sea.
The stars swing out like masthead
lights
On anchored ships at rest;
But cloud-land's ships that dared the
heights
Of that uncertain quest,
Lie wrecked on the red barrier of the
west.
KATHLEEN DALZIEL.
A star, low-mirrored in a muddy pool,
Weaves magic on the waters.
Mud and slime and ugliness become
A silver home for quivering loveliness.
For even unclean things
Grasp greedily when beauty conde-
scends.
But far above, higher than 'thought,
The star burns on,
Wrapped in a shining pride,
Remote, aloof, and all inviolate.

--o--
A ghostly wind just stirring the pine trees
Along the sandy crescent where they grow--
A fragile wind-a sea-lost, pirate breeze
That scarcely moves their branches to and
fro.
The darkness of black opal on the sand
Where, late, the gold noose of the Sun-God
shone;
No glimmering light by sea, no light by land,
No beacon ray to pin one's faith upon.
Not one pale star the midnight vigil keeps;
The starless sea reflects a starless sky;
And a grey breaker, like a grey horse, leaps
To where by North Steyne cold the grey
rocks lie.
Keen sea-salt perfumes through the darkness
steal,
And out at sea strange southern thunders
roll--
Manly deserted! In my heart I feel
The sun-lost weeping of her midnight soul.

LONGFELLOW.
Night's gloomy spell is broken, and the light
Is pale and tender in the waking East;
The sudden sun with splendour sails to sight,
The wailing night-bird's weary note has ceased.
All, all rejoice as day and life return,
Bearing a song of gladness to the hearts
Of weary mortals who in patience yearn
For aught to salve the wounds of Life's fierce darts.
O weary ones, look upward to the Light
That guides our stumbling footsteps to the bourn
Where care-worn hearts are soothed, and where the
night
Is all unknown amidst eternal morn,
Where life shall spring from death, and joy from pain,
And earthly loss shall be a heavenly gain.",The Queenslander ,"901,484,680,540,680,833,834,567,406,494,220,734,641,753,794,611,667,664,866,660,825,899,88,624,900,691",Sat 4 Jun 1892,"427,984,1117,1186,1269,2000,2017,1351,1381,1414,1444,1493,1524,1554,1587,1625,1654,1691,1720,1756,1787,1817,1858,1887,1920,1950","427,639,537,613,537,466,466,595,597,597,1079,433,466,433,466,433,465,433,466,433,460,433,498,458,433,433",19824480,Page 1073

"" Go it, little ones !"" is. our advice to the four
footers who are waging war so gallantly against
their big brothers, the regulation-height Volun
teers. Is a man's heart to be measured by his
inches, or his courage to be gauged by
the length of his small-clothes Y Cer
tainly not, so many a tall wife can
testify who has chosen her lord as one
who chooses one's cheese or one's sherry-for
quality not quantity Under the present standard,
Napoleon himself would be disqualified, and there
may be many Napoleons amongst our small
friends, only awaiting the day and the hour to
prove themselves the men. Especially for riflemen
does the disqualification of insufficient inches
seem absurd, if the distinction may not be
said to be all in their favour. Didn't
David ""pot"" Goliath?' and even given j
equal accuracy of aim, it must be
harder to hit a little hop-o'-my-thumb fellow, who
could ""cover"" easily behind a well-grown cabbage,
than a great hulking grenadier, as good a mark as
a haystack. Let our little friends stick up for
their rights as men, not monkeys, and at least de
mand to be formed into a special corps, to be
called, say, the Tom Thumbs, the Martial Manni
kins, or the Great Invisibles !
Saturday night ended tho opera season proper, to
be supplemented, however, thanks to tho pluck of
"" the enterprising lessee,"" by twenty-four nights
more of song, for which, doubtless, tho public
will bo duly grateful. Notwithstanding the
croakers, tho season we are glad to hear, has
been in every sense a genuine success. Finan
cially, we understand, the management are quite'
satisfied, and if tho music-loving public are some
what less so, the fault is mainly with themselves.
We have it on the authority of one of the leading
members of the company, that to sing in the stuffy,
dust-laden atmosphere of the old Vic, is some
thing very nearly equivalent to asphyxia in a
pepper-mill. In some of his tenderest scenes
when he ought to have been sighing his very soul
out in flute-like melody, he has with the
greatest difficulty saved himself from fright
ening the prima donna into fits by half
sneezing his head off, while some of his
finest bravura passages have been utterly ruined
by a sudden sensation in tho thorax, for all the
world as if ho had swallowed the cayenne pepper
bottle. This superfluity of dust in one depart
ment of the theatre, however, is of course no
reason why the public should not come down
with their dust as handsomely as ever in another.
The programme for the extra season is a splendid
one, if the theatre itself is a bad one, that is all
the stronger reason why the public should liber
ally second the energetic efforts of the manager to
make tho very best of it.
The wisdom of Solomon, we are afraid, does
not often pervade the magisterial decisions ]
at our Police Courts, but it seems to have
been much needed on Thursday, when a case
of disputed identity occurred that might have
puzzled the wise monarch himself satisfactorily
to decide. It was a case not of baby against baby,
nor of butcher against baronet, but of Pompey
against Prince-the rival claimants being twp
somewhat excited individuals named respectively
Burling and Twemlow, and the interesting subject
in dispute, that frequent cause of strife and back
biting, a ""dawg."" Burling had an unfading
remembrance of a canine mend named Pom
pey, but had lost sight of him for some thirteen
months, when he found him cheerfully trotting after
a new master, and answering to a new name,
Prince. A claim to Pompey was met by a counter
claim to Prince, and several witnesses -were called
to prove ou tho one side that the sham Prince was
the real Pompey, and on the other that Prince had
been Prince from the days of his earliest puppy
dom. The simplest way to have settled the
matter, would probably have been to ask the clog ;
but theirworshipswere not equal to this exercise of
common-sense, and after the changes had been
rung for an hour or more on Pompey and Prince,
Prince and Pompey, decided in favour of Pompey,
on the principle, apparently, of that generous
British justice that always takes the weaker side.
The Prince of one day is, ' therefore, the Pompey of
next day, and it is to be hoped will know himself
under his new name, as he is scarcely likely to
know his now master.
5 {Usually the Bar is the preliminary stage, the
stepping-stone to tho Bench, but Mr. ex-District
Court Judge Simpson has resolved to reverse the
natural order of things, and gracefully descend
from the Bench to the Bar. This latent decision
of the learned ex-Judge, like many previous ones,
shows «. pood deal of originality, and not a little
pluck. To be sure the Bench to be abandoned was
only the District Court, Bench, about which there
was a finality that to a man of ability and fair
ambition might well appear unsatisfactory. But
on the other hand, on the same snug judicial seat,
there was also a certainty which our
learned friend - the "" hedging "" proviso of
the Crown Prosecutorship notwithstanding-must
be content to miss. However, there is no doubt
ample room and verge enough for the learned
gentleman's energies in the fair field of the Courts,
where we hope ho will often figuro to his own and
others' advantage. Moreover, there is a good pre
cedent in point. The present Attorney-General
also relinquished tho ermine (figuratively speak
ing) for the bombazine, and what Mr. Innes lias
done there can surely be no reason why Mr. Simp
son should not dare to do. At any rate, in the
whole history of the bar, there probably never was
a time when the demand, for even
ordinary talent, was greater, or where j
to fair industry and ability there was a surer
chance of many a fat oyster. If we were attorneys,
Mr. Simpson should share with us our first and
fattest, if only for his pluck. As we don't happen
to have that honour, he has, less nourishing, per
haps, but quite as hearty, our best wishes.
To any one. who, like ourselves, heard Dr.
Vaughan on Sunday night for the first time, one
thing must have been very apparent-the infinite
power of words artistically treated at the hands of
a master. Dr. Vaughan is an orator, so far as
great natural advantages of voice and presence
and consummate art can make him one ; and his
"" oration"" on Sunday hight was eloquent'ond im
pressive, so far as a mere wonderful outpouring
of words, "" only that and nothing more,"" can be
said to be either. If we say that it was nothing
more, that, to us at least, its excellence as a piece
of brilliant declamation was only equalled in
degree by its intellectual feebleness, we shah
probably be set down in certain quarters as gross
heathens, alike in taste and in creed-as, if tho
ßomnn Catholic Archbishop on the altar
steps of St. Mary's be the truest type of
both, we no doubt are ; still, it must
be said that delightful as it was to listen« to so
eloquent a master of ""pure English undefiled,""
and to watch tho noble face and form: both
instinct-there could be no doubt about that, how
ever one might differ as to the occasion-with a
divine enthusiasm, we should have liked it very
much better had the gifted orator, intellectually
speaking, had anything to say. Possibly we ex
pected too much. Perhaps it was not to be sup
posed that in dealing with what is to our minds
one of the grossest delusions of this or any other
age, a Roman Catholic Archbishop could be other
wise than tender. However that may be, we wero
certainly disappointed in the matter of the lecture,
in common, we have no doubt, with a good half
of the vast crowd who had responded to his
Lordship's advertisement. Tho popular impression
certainly was that a lecture by Dr. Vaughan on
""Visions and Revelations,"" meant a lecture on
Spiritualism, in its modern development ; and
this, with the fame of the lecturer,
would have been quite enough to cram even a
larger building than the temporary cathedral with
an eager audience. Hut the popular impression
was wrong. Dr. Vaughan fought as shy of tho
spirits, good, bad, or indifferent, as the "" good St.
Anthony"" of the "" devils short and devils tall""in
the ballad ; and, instead of a lecture on modern
Spiritualism, we were treated to a sermon on the
Roman Catholic"" Science of Mystical Theology ""of
which the chief recommendation seemed to bo
that it was as abstruse almost as alcbymy, only
the initiated being able to compass its mysteries,
and as old almost as astrology. Wo shali go and
hear Dr. Vaughan again. He is the most eloquent
of all our public preachers and teachers, and
facile princeps, tho primo tenore of our cloricnl
stage But it is no more the true eloquence that
moves the hearts or convinces the heads of men
than the concert solos, before and after his ser
mon, were genuine devotion.
Our poor patient, persecuted Premier has had
another blow. The malice of his enemies pursues
him even into the recess. When the tongue of
Parliamentary detraction is tied, the Press takes
up the ciy, and the Herald, hard up for readable,
matter, re-hashes the howls and libels of the Op
position. ""To what base uses may we come,
Horatio !"" when not even the Premier of tho
country, tho immaculate Minister ! of and for tho
people, is made the subject for a hack writer to
blunt his quill upon, and earn his dinner withal.
So Mr. Parkes, injured in his tenderest part, his
hatred of anything like trickery or treachery,
makes mild complaint in the Herald yesterday,
He has been charged, it seems, in that journal, with
conduct, at which hiß whole noble soul revolts.
He has been accused of making a violent personal
attack upon an opponent, (Mr. Robertson), and then
of walking out of the House and conniving at a
count out. Did he, could he, ever be guilty of
anything of the kind? Was he ever known to
say an unkind or abusive word of any one P And
has not every act of his life been as clear and as
clean for any one's inspection as-well, as his hon!
friend's ""waters of oblivion""-in which, by the
way, he thinks it would do the editor of the
Herald no harm to be sunk fathoms deep. It is
impossible not to sympathise with the hon. gen
tleman, as one would with any other ill-used
creature whose "" raws "" are being perpetually
touched up. But Mr. Parkes has, at least, the con
solation of much fellowship of woe.. He is not
the only unhappy man by many hundreds of rash
misguided individuals, whom the reading of, or
attempt to read, a Herald leading article hos made
sick. ^
The imposing-looking gentleman in the black
wide-awake, with gold tassel, to whom the faith
ful touch their hats as Archbishop Coadjutor, is
not only evidently wide-awake himself, but seems
to have a quiet but most effective way of doing
things that must be eminently satisfactory to those
whom it concerns. With the internal organisa-.
tion of any of our several religious establishments,
we have, of course, little or nothing to do ; but it
is curious, in this case, to notice how vigorously
a now broom can sweop, even when it
might have been supposed that the resistance
to anything like healthy renovation, would have
been strongest. Thus Dr. Vaughan had no soonor
recovered his land-legs and taken the edge oil' his
polemical appetite by a short bout with his
Protestant Lordship of Sydney, than ho mado a
clean sweep of St, Mary's, and the places if
reverend and very reverend gentlemen, who.«
names had been household words for a generation,
Jcnow them no more. Then we heard that til«)
most reverend, fcc, &c, had taken ui»
his abode at St. John's College, much to
the patriotic wrath of Mr. John Stewart,
who at once wanted to know how many
more bishops the country was going to board and
lodge. It was explained that Dr. Vaughan was, in
his new quarters, simply as the guest of the
rector, Dr. Forrest, who, with his one student,
found life in this vast vacuum somewhat lonely.
But there are guests as dangerous as a cuckoo va.
a thrush's nest, and wo cannot say that we were
surprised to read in Saturday's papers, that Dr.
Forrest has resigned, and that Dr. Vaughan
reigns in his stead. It is certainly time
that St. John's College should have something more
to show for the money it has cost and still costs
the State, than the "" one student"" who has so long
vexed the soul of Mr, Stewart and a well-fe.l
Rector. Dr. Vaughan will probably be scarcely a i
good a "" chaw"" in the lecture-room at St. John's 11
e appears to be in the pulpit at St. Mary's, buth >
will, doubtless, give tho "" one student"" some com
panions, and so fardo tho State some service,th 1.
it will at least get something for its money. A .

CANTO THE THIRD
All the world's a stage,--
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits, and their entrances,
And one man in his day plays many parts.""
SHAKSPERE.
""All these, and more, came flocking.""
MILTON.
""Whoop--off they go; haloo they shout--they fly!
They spur--they whip--they crack!""
TENNANT.
The season was over--the Play-house was closed,--
And the actors from labours to please us reposed;
Bade adieu, for a time, to their play books and dresses,
And ceased for a little to please or distress us;
Descended to earth from the ""heaven of invention,""
No longer attracted the public attention,
But shrunk into common-place creatures of clay,
And wore the unclassical garb of the day.
The hero of yesterday, hot from the fight,
Is cooling his parched throat at Wyatt's to-night;
And Richard and Hamlet are smoking their pipes,
And Shylock sips Cadell's Australian swipes,--
And Tragedy's features, enveloped in smoke,
Relax from their sternness, and join in the joke
With Simes and his brethren, whose looks seem to say--
""As we journey through life, let us live by the way.""
II.
And Pitt-street felt the change;--no more
Were gathered round the theatre door
The crowds of idle men, and women,
Mechanics, artizans, and seamen,
And ragged boys, with roguish faces,
Who used, with mischief and grimaces,
On acting nights to smoke and prate,
And swarm around the outer gate;
Like bees, that when the skies are sunny,
Group round their hives with loads of honey
But, when the summer season's o'er,
Pursue their busy tasks no more.
III.
The gin-shops felt the change and sighed;
For though their ample ports stood wide,
And all, with open arms, invited
To walk within, and be delighted
With all that pleasure can supply,
To tempt the taste, or charm the eye;--
Few, few responded to thr call:
Was heard no more the midnight brawl;
Was seen no more the bully's swagger;
The drunkard had forgot to stagger,
And, wakened from his maniac dream,
Had ceased his Maker to blaspheme:
The star of Peace, with aspect mild,
On the fair prospect looked and smiled;
The desert showed one spot of green;--
Oh! who would wish to change the scene?
IV.
But other actors were in training,
To break the calm that then was reigning;
And many a man, who ne'er before
Had crossed the hated Play-house door;
Nor listened to its Syren song,
So pleasing to the giddy throng;
Nor viewed the actor's mimic art,
So grateful to the listless heart,
Were striving now, with might and main,
To deck themselves in trappings vain,
And tread the very Thespian board
Which heretofore they so abhorred;
And be the very thing their eyes,
Erewhile, pretended to despise.
Oh! man, thou riddle of creation,
Whate'er thy taleuts, wealth, or station,
Who canst, without a reason, blame
The actor's dubious path to fame,
And yet, inconstant as the breeze,
Thyself pursue that path to please;
Will not the world thy changes mock,
Thou animated weather-cock!
Yes! and the world, in man's despite,
Has been, and ever will be, right.
V.
Strange that our eyes, which love to scan
The failings of our fellow-man,
And sift his actions, and pretend
His very thoughts to comprehend,
Should be so blind to see--so slow
Our failings or ourselves to know:
Yet so it is; we strive to smother
The deeds of our deserving brother;
And should his fancy haply choose
To pay addresses to the Muse,
Or cultivate the arts polite,
And pictures paint--or poems write,
Or do whate'er excels us quite;
That instant, with malicious grin,
In thoughts by day, and dreams by night,
A lurking Devil moves within;
The same that stirred the Tempter's mind,
Against the mother of mankind,
And caused the fall, and brought disgrace
And death to all the human race;
And still survives on earth the same,
For Envy is the Demon's name;
And still delights to break our rest
And agitate our jealous breast,
And turn to vinegar and gall
The milk of kindness in our soul;
And oft, in falsehood's cause enlisted,
Discovers faults that ne'er existed.
Oh! that we were so Argus-eyed,
To see ourselves as others see;
How quickly would our selfish pride
Be changed to meek humility!
VI.
'Tis like the tale we early learned
""The lawyer, or the tables turned.""
A curate to a lawyer went,
To lay before him his complaint;
The lawyer's bull, I know not how,
Had killed the humble curate's cow;
But by mistake (the story goes,
And puts its finger to its nose),
By some mistake, the curate said
It was the lawyer's cow was dead.
The man of law waxed wroth, and swore
The curate should the loss restore.
""Think of my wife--my children all--
My outlay great--my income small--""
The curate urged, ""who could prevent
So unforeseen an accident?
Be merciful I pray--forget
The sad mischance--remit the debt;
And Heaven will bless you while you live,
For it is heavenly to forgive.""
""Zounds! Sir, forgive?--remit?--absurd!
I'm busy;--nay, Sir, not a word;
My cow is killed,--in broil or battle,
By one of your misgoverned cattle;
The money must be paid in full,
Or, in exchange, give up the bull;
That's law, that's justice;--would you more?
Then here's the bill, and there's the door.
""Why, Sir,"" the Curate meek replied,
""I fear unconsciously I've lied;
'Twas very stupid, I avow,
But 'twas your bull that killed my cow.
""Oh! ho!"" the cunning lawyer faltered,
""Why then, of course, the case is altered:
'Tis very true, Sir, I'll allow,
My bull has chanced to kill your cow;
But surely, if your heifers choose
A neighbour's kindness to abuse,
And roam my field in search of pasture
I can't protect them from disaster;
Nay--answer not--nor plead your cause
I must uphold our righteous laws;
Which justly judge when men dispute,
And strike the babbling clients mute;
In browsing on forbidden grass,
Your cow, 'tis clear, committed trespass;
A battle followed--in the fight
Your cow got worsted--'sarved her right.' ""
VII.
O glorious justice! Majesty severe
Shakes her proud curls and sits in judgment here.
The tale's a fable: granted;--but its strain
Conveys a moral palpable and plain;
Which he who runs may read, and lay to heart,
He'll find examples in life's varied mart;
Self is the God to whom we pay our vow,
The golden calf to which all nations bow;
Our dearest friends are sacrificed to mammon,
In friendship's sacred name--but this is gammon.
VIII.
Dissolve my dream,
Resume the theme,
We've trifled all too long;
Will any of the muses deign
To smile upon my song;
And guide my pen,
While once again
To higher flights I rise,
And sing of deeds whose splendour shames
The glories of the skies?
The sun is up that ushers in
The all auspicious day;
And shines from Woolloomooloo's heights
On Sydney's spacious bay:
And gilds the distant mountain tops,
That in the clouds repose;
And o'er the stately vessels' sides
A flood of glory throws:
And decks the woods with radiant hues
Around the fair Domain,
And makes the House of Government
Appear, without a stain,
A marble palace, where the great
And noble might abide,--
Where princes--where our gracious
Victoria might reside.
And down the hills
The trickling rills,

(FROM THE GERMAN OP HEINE.)
Visitors, to tbe Rhineland (says ""Tho Queen"")
must have observed near the shrines of the Bles
83<l Virgin in the various churches numbers of
sinall waxen jmages which are offered by crippled
or suffering devotees, in the faith that they will
bo cured by miraculous power. ""Our Lady of
Kevlcar"" is supposed to possess an extraordinary
gilt of this kind; every year, on the Festival of
; Assumption a long procession goes out from Co
logue, bearing in its train numbers of halt and
I waimea, .who carry those waxen offerings, hop
j ina; through these means to be made whole. The
j poet Heine relates that a boy with whom he
ä studied in the .Franciscan school at Dusseldorf,
itol.l him that he had, been cured of a lame foot
by an offering of the above kind. Many years
after, it chanced that the; two lads were fellow
students at Bonn, when the one referred to by
» Jíoínc reminded him bf the miraculous cure of his
I fot-e, adding earnestly, ""Now I will offer the Holy
Mother a waxen hearL"" Long after, in 1S19, the
poof, walking by the-Rhine, heard the familiar
chant of the Kevlaar procession, and, as it drew
nsar, perceived his schoolfellow among the pil
grims, led by his mother, looking very pale and ill.

This book is like ft garden} just a placo,
Whoso soil prepared, tho tiny seed rcceivoB >
Tho seed springs up a plant, which grows apaoc,
. And flourishes with grcon and teador leaves ;
The plant brings forth tho buds ; and so tho book,
Just like tho plant, must buds of pleasure show.
Which will develop as you f urthor look ;
Watch, then, and seo how fast tho bhoots will growt
Thc buds then open, aud in turn produce
The petals of tho Howers you so inuch love ;
The book shall blossom out with flowers profuso,
Aud source of many a pleasant lesson provo.
Each flower evolves into a beauteous cup,
Catching the dow, and giving forth perfume
That fills tho air with a sweet incouse up,
While from the sun all flowers their tints assume
So should this book bo formed to catch tho dow
Of wit and wisdom, and the mental nose
Should oft inhalf tho inconse, fresh and now,
Prom tinted flowers of Poetry and Proso.
The cup is full of houoy, which tho beo
Delights to sip, as nectar from on high ;
Or carry off into her hive, where she
Feeds the young bees, and stores tho balance by.
III.
So you may sip tho sweets the book contains,
And hive within your brain tho precious food,
And feed your ""young ideas"" with what remains.
After you've had enough to do you good.
At longth tho petals die away and fall,
And iu tho cup tho seeds will ripon inst ;
And when maturo you'll gather large and small,
To sow again in the rich soil at last.
And, when for a result ouco more you look,
You'll find, I trust, your garden is so full
That you must malee another garden book
Before fresh flowers of fancy you can cull.

THE LAST AND PRESENT CENTURIES.-In au
obituary notice of Canon Beadon, the TIMES states
that he took his degree in the first year of the present
century. This is an orror ; his B. A. degreo is dated,
in the list of Oxford graduates, May, 1S0Ö. Now, tho
last century ended, as it appears to mo, on Dee. 31,
1800, and tho present commenced on Jan. 1,1S01.

"" NINE POINTS OP THE LAW.""-Tho following,
which I have met with in an odd corner of an old
magazine, is ingenious. Has it anything to do with
tho abovo saying ?
"" To him that goes to law nine things aro requisite s
1st, a good deal of monoy; 2nd, a good deal of
patience; 3rd, a good cause; 4th, a good attorney;
5th, good counsel ; Gfch, good evidence ; 7th a good
jury; Sth, a good judge; Ufch, good luck.""

SATURDAY AND THE KO Y AT. FAMILY.-Tho follow
ing cutting from the GLOBE newspaper is curious, and
worthy, I think, of a corner in "" Sf. and Q."" :
FATAL SATUKDAYS.-Thc death of tho lamented Princess
of Hesse on thc same day of tho month and week ns that o!
the Prince Consort at racted general attention, but it may
not Late been so universally observed .that Saturday Lo«

I DEATHS ON OB ASSOCIATED WITH THE STAGS?.
-I do not know whother tko following graphio
account has-been sent to "" N. and Q."" ;
Mus. MONTFORD.-Gay wrote his well-known ballad of
"" Blaek.Eyed Sufran"" upon this celebrated actress, who
was contemporary with Cibber. Alter her retirement from
the stoga, love and the ingratitude of a bosom friend hav
ing deprived her of reason, ehe was placed in a receptacle
for lunatics. Ono day, during a. lucid interval, Bho asked
her attendaut what play was to bo performed that evening,
and was told Hamlet. In this tragedy she had always been
received with rantnre as Ophelia. The recollection struck
her forcibly, and with that onnuing which is so often allied
to insanity, she contrived to'elude the caro of the keepera,
and got to the theatre, where Bho concealed herself till tho
scene in which Ophelia outers in her insane stato. Then
she pushed on tho stage, boforo the Indi* who bod performed
the provious part of tho character could come on, and ex
hibited a moro perfect representation of madness than tho
utmost exertions of mimic art could effect. She was, in
truth, Ophelia horsolf, to the tnnazement of the performers
and to 'tho astonishment of tho audience. Nature having
made this last effort, her vital powers failed her. On going
oil sho exclaimed, "" It is all o vor."" She was immediately
conveyed back to ker place of soouri ty, and, in a fow days
af tor,
I "" like a lily drooping,
Bow'd her hoad and died.""

SHOWEBB OP SULPHUR.-Tho following cutting
from tho London TIMES weather column, June 16,
appears to verify tho account forwarded to Mr.
Picton, and communicated by him to "" N. and Q.,""
of sulphur showers in tho colony of Viotoria :
""During the past wook, after heavy rain, a thin
film of sulphur has boonobsorvod at Windsor, Slough,
J and in tho neighbourhood generally, to settle upon
[ tho súrfaco of rain-water caught in tho butts and
cisterns. The phenomenon at first did not attract
much attention, but being observed on differont oc
casions it has given riso to muoh speculation as to
tho causo of it, thoro hoing no manufactures in 'tho
neighbourhood at all likely to have produced it. It .
has boen suggested that a sulphureous vapour may
have been wafted to this country by tho recent south,
east winds and arrested anddeDosited in tho rain.""

JEWISH PHYSIOGNOMY.--Tho following extract
will furnish an additional note on this subjcot:
""Thero aro ateo two very singular colonies of Jew«
at Cochin. Tko ono set are quito whito in complexion,
and the. other quito black. I was prosont at the
Berrico in a synagogue, and saw tho richly deooratod
rolls of tho books of MOBOS carried round in proces
sion and kissed by tho congregation, after tho law had
boon road by tho Rabbis from a central roading-deBk.""

THE STOUT OF A MAN WHO SOLD HIS SOUL.-AS
long ago as tho year 1839 I road in some magazine* a
story of a man who sold his soul. Ho was to bo a
man by day and a Bkoleton by night, and he was to
lire as long as he could koop tho secretor' the chango,
which of course occurred twice a day. Ho lost his
soul, but ho livod threo hundred years and met with
tho most extraordinary adventures. H any of your
I readers will toll me the namo of the story and where
it is to bo found I shall bo vorv much oblitrod.
i B. B. BETTS.
On Friday a cabman named Joseph Bishop, 'of tho
Glebe, whilst nnder tho influence of drink, was
driving up Brickfield Hill, near Campbell-street, at
a furious rate, whon ho ran into tho back of a
waggonotto that was going up tho hill. Tho cab was
smashed into piooeB, and Bishop thrown violently tb
tho ground. Ho was picked np in an insonsiblo con
dition, bleeding from cuts on his head. The wag-,
gonotto received somo damage, and tho occupants'
woro torribly frightonod. Bishop waa romovod to
tho Infirmary by constable John Saunders. When
consciousness restored ho was taken homo.
Wo have boen shown the gold modal awarded to
International Exhibition. It is indeed a magnificent
trophy; in it aro combined tho massiveness
of idea oí tho English workman, Gallie
delicacy of manipulation, and olassio beauty of
design. The modal, which is of high quality gold,
and weighs fully 3£oz, has on its obverse sido an ex
quisitely drawn representation of the goddess of
Liberty and the words ""République Frangaiso ;"" on
tho reverso appears a herald bearing a scroll,
on which is engraved tho name oí
tho recipient firm. Tho company aro tho
holders of the only gold medal awarded to the
colonies for this branch of industry at Paris, and it
may bo mentioned that they wore also first prizo
medallists at Vienna and Philadelphia.
Tho now time-table just issued by tho railway
authorities, and which came into force on Monday
last, offers no greater facilities for travelling by rail
on Sundays than tho old timc-tablo. Moro inconve
nient hours for trains to start on Sundays could not
bo devised. Tho first train loaves tho Rodfern station
at half-past 8 in tho morning-just about tho orthodox
time for breaking ono's fast, and certainly too early
for people to got ready if they want to travol by rail
in tho morning. Then, tho next train goes at a qua'r
tor-past 1 o'clock, whon pcoplo aro at dinner, and
thcro is no other train till half-past 4. The incoming
trains aro evidently arranged so as to accommodate
people who may wish to como to tho Sydnoy churches,
for tho first leaves Parramatta at half-past 9, and
arrives in Sydnoy at about kalf-past 10. Tho train
leaving Sydnoy at a quarter-past 1 seems to have boen
put on to tako theso passengers back again. Tho fow
other trains seem to havo been arranged on a simi
lar principle, and without the slighest . consideration
either for Sydney pcoplo who may wish to embrace,
perhaps, the only opportunity they have during the
week for visiting their friends in the suburbs, or for
Sydney people who may -wish to go to some of the
suburban places of worship. Tho whole arrange
ment is absurd, and bears evidonco of selfish clerical
influenco at work behind the scenes.

'Good evening, mate, I hope I don't alarm you in
the least;
I'm on my way to Devil's Gully to find a man
called Priest.
I've just come up from Murphy's Luck, the old
man's near pegged out;
Perhaps you know the man I want—he lives up
hereabout.
' I've ridden hard for sixty miles, my horse is
getting stiff;

whiff.
So if you don't object I'll hobble Tempest for the
night;
There's lots of feed around your camp—he won't
go out of sight.'
' I know your man,' the digger said; ' but come,
let's have some tea,
Or if you prefer a drop of rum, why, here, yon
see,
I always keep a little by to welcome chaps like.
you.
So here's a Merry Christmas now, and many of
them too.'
'The same to you, my friend. Ah, yes, 'tis
Christmas once again I
To most men it brings happiness—to me 'tis
always pain.
Some twenty yean ago I lost my dearest friend
and best;
To think that we may meet again seems almost
like a jest.
1 Now, just to make the time go by—that is, if
you've a mind—
I'll tell you of that Christmas, and how Murphy
made a find.
You'll keep the story secret, mate ?—old Murphy
won't last long;
I would not wish for all the world to do him any
wrong.
' The three of us were shipmates, and we all got
into work
On Ballyohannon cattle run, then owned by
Paddy Burke—
Ton must remember sixty-six, the Oympie just
broke out—
Poor Tom and I were stockmen there, and
Murphy routeabout;
1 From near and far the ush was great, for times
were very bad. * '
Of course we started out as well—but would we
never had,
For though we tackled to the work and stood it
well a while,
We found that those who did the least made up
the biggest pile.
1 Thus things went on till Christmas came and
brought its usual cheer;
The publicans got all our cash, and we got too
mnch beer.
New Year's Day fairly cleaned us oat, and left us
on the rocks,
Except that Tom expeoted soon an English
Christmas box.
' The letter came, and Tom went down to town
to get the cash.
Now, mate, I hope you will not think that I am
over rash,
But Murphy also disappeared. I'm sure you'll
think it strange
Tom ne'er again returned to tell us how he crossed
the range.
' Some twenty days or more went by, I'd just
dozed off to sleep,
And such a horrid dream I had, it makes my flesh
still creep;
I saw Tom Humphrey on his horse jost crossing
o'er a creek,
And close behind him rose a man—oh, mate, I
scarce can speak.
'Just pour me out a drop of rum! The man was
masked and tall;
He had a hunting crop; it's end was loaded with
a ball;
He raised it high, poor Tom fell down, he dragged
him to the bush;
'Twas all but dark; I wakened then. Some one
gave me a push.
' I looked around; there Murphy stood all trem
bling. "" Mat,"" said he,
"" I've made a find, and mean that you shall share
the lot with me.""
I seized my gun and looked about to find my
powder flask,
He looked so like Tom's murderer; the man who
wore the mask.
'He told me he had been prospecting up the
Forest Creek,
And came acroßß Tom Humphrey lying wonnded,
pale, and weak.
He knew he had not long to live, and whispered—
Murphy said—
"" I leave my all to Mat and you; think of me when
I'm dead.""
' I looked Mick Murphy in the face, and levelling
my gun,
"" You are his murderer,"" I said. "" There's one
chance for you—run.""
He turned and find, a guilty man, and soon was
out of sight;
And from that day to this we've never met until
. last night.
1 Now he is dying. "" Mat,"" said he, "" I want you
here alone.
I'm glad that you've turned up at last before ray
life is done.
There's something lying on my soul which you
alone must know.
You guessed aright. I robbed poor Tom, but
murder him—oh, no!
' I left him bleeding by the creek. I dared not
go to look
If still he lived; but there—see Mat—you'll find
his pocket-book.
I banked the money in his name, and, oh, I wish
to heaven
That Tom was here a living man, to Bay ' You are
forgiven.'
""'Once in a dream I saw him, by his camp fire
burning clear—
It seemed to be in Devil's Gully, sixty miles from
here.
Hiß name was changed; they called him Priest.
Oh, bring him while I live,
If lift could only know my pain, I'm Bure he would
forgive.""'
The digger rose, and looked about, and said,
'Jußt wait awhile;
I've got to see a friend of mine o'er yonder—half
a mile.'
He caught his horse and saddled him, and rode
until the dawn,
Nor halted till at last he stopped in front of
Murphy's lawn.
He walked into his old mate's room, and knelt
down at his feet.
The dying penitent awoke from slumber calm and
sweet,
And smiled to see Tom kneeling there, and wept
to hear him pray,
' God make his passage easy, and take all his sins
away 1'
That night, ere sunset, Mat returned, to find his
digger friend
Was Tom himself, arrived in time to sooth old
Murphy's end.
And sure enough the pocket-book was there, all
safe and sound,
With interest added twenty years. Tom's Christ
mas-box was found.",The Queenslander ,"895,870,869,819,883,175,897,237,904,423,904,189,904,222,903,98,904,110,906,280,903,357,904,66,906,74,904,181,907,833,906,222,905,171,906,189,905,293,905,223,907,284,907,117,907,170,909,284,910,212,907,373,923,843,907,186,902,224,907,284,915,436,904,197,907,230,905,267,904,277,903,177,906,282,906,180,914,321,905,194,904,217,903,308,902,302,906,116,906,302,904,291,884,424,906,304,902,235,905,270,903,244,904,278,907,268,903,189,907,144,907,398,907,226,907,260,906,201,908,204,905,315,907,384,907,178,906,290,905,173,906,167,901,285,899,85,904,480,904,172,903,326,906,132,897,276,901,285,899,298,901,109,901,314,901,123,901,234,899,258,897,283,880,350",Sat 17 Dec 1892,"383,465,529,1202,622,663,696,740,781,817,852,899,954,997,1033,1077,1110,1156,1189,1233,1290,1332,1370,1420,1447,1499,1526,1567,1627,1666,1706,1746,1784,1827,1863,1904,1964,2005,2041,2083,2121,2154,2200,2250,2301,2340,2378,2419,2458,2498,2537,2576,2636,2674,2715,2754,2792,2833,2871,2912,2973,3011,3052,3090,3129,3170,3208,3247,3309,3348,3387,3427,3466,3506,3545,3584,3644,3683,3721,3762,3800,3841,3879,3920,3992,4030,4069,4109,4146,4187,4224,4268,4335,4375,4414,4455,4493,4534,4572,4611,4671,4712,4751,4789,4828,4868,4907,4945,5006,5055,5085,5123,5162,5203,5241,5280,5339,5378,5417,5455,5494,5534,5573,5611,5682,5723,5761,5800,5838,5879,5917,5956,6025,6065,6102,6143,6180,6219,6258,6298,6433,6474,6512,6551,370,411,444,490,543,589,622,674,701,746,778,825,882,926,961,1005,1038,1082,1118,1161","268,283,283,1271,282,342,268,342,263,342,263,339,263,339,263,339,263,337,261,339,261,339,258,339,260,334,260,334,257,334,257,334,257,332,255,331,255,331,254,329,252,331,252,328,252,328,250,326,249,326,249,326,233,324,246,323,247,324,246,324,233,323,247,323,246,323,244,323,246,323,246,321,244,321,244,321,236,320,241,320,241,320,243,320,243,320,239,317,238,317,239,315,239,318,236,323,238,315,236,315,238,315,235,312,235,313,236,313,233,313,233,307,233,312,233,233,235,312,233,309,233,309,233,310,233,307,233,304,233,312,233,309,233,307,233,309,233,309,233,309,233,307,233,309,1239,1310,1235,1309,1235,1310,1235,1310,1235,1309,1235,1307,1235,1307,1235,1309,1235,1309,1235,1306",19829849,Page 2

By Lydia M. D. O'Neil
I Stand beside the Border Gate, that guards the border trails;
One highway into Queensland leads, and one to New South Wales;
And far across the lonely Range the rolling ribbons run;
One goes down to Sydney-town, one north to find the sun:
And I must choose which I shall take — I must not here remain,
And when I pass the Border Gate, I cannot turn again.
How many miles to Sydney-town, how many miles to Ayr ?—
How many miles to Happiness what distance to Despair ? —
I have no roof-tree o'er my head, I have no hearth, nor sill;
My feet are free to take the road and wander where they will.
Which is the way to Heart's Desire, and which the path to Pain ? —
For when I've passed the Border Gate I cannot turn again.
How can I tell which trail to take, or what my feet may find ?
I cannot know what lies before, but only what's behind.
I can but spin a copper coin, as vagrants all have spun —
Then south-away to Sydney-town, or north to seek the sun.
And that the coin spin wise and well, may kindly fates ordain,
For once I've passed the Border Gate, I cannot turn again.",The Courier-Mail ,"706,524,968,1012,900,959,1024,885,1011,947,981,962,1063,942,1038,901,906,959,984,943,1023",Sat 8 Aug 1936,"6366,6472,6543,6584,6620,6656,6690,6726,6787,6822,6859,6895,6926,6965,7026,7061,7096,7133,7167,7204,7259","3300,3390,3110,3161,3121,3120,3119,3117,3120,3119,3083,3123,3121,3121,3120,3122,3100,3123,3123,3122,3078",38497131,Page 14

A Scrub Farm Morning.
'Tis quiet in the morning ere the sunbeams kiss the
dew,
When the valley's misty blankets hide the lower lands
from view,
And the smoke from clearing fires, made night
before,
Lies half way up the ridges like headland! from the
shore,
And Just beyond the fires, as tho' in slumber deep,
And loth to heat the valleys and wake them from
their sleep,
Is seen the late corn cobbing, the logs and stumpi
repose
Beneath the feathery flow'rlng, and pumpkins 'tween
the rows.
Nought breaks the ttllly sllonoo save a wallaby or
two,
Who hurries home, his maize meal well covered up
from view;
He takes hia leave desulter, and has no time to sp«ro;
He knows first streak of daylight will bring the farmer
there,
His muzzle-loading musket choked to the mouth to
kill-
Three draohms and more of powder, and alugs a half
Sint'a fill. .
wary tread and stealthy the farmer gains the
corn,
Boon hid beneath the Ink Plant he waits the coming
dawn;
With daylight's early morning he knows far up the
rango
The cockatoos have started to give his corn at onange.
Whon daylight's early glanoes gold tip the range's
crest
Too soon to woke the clearing and misty valley's
rest—
'Tis then the straying sunbeams in chasing out the
ni ht ,
In joy reflect and sparkle on apeok* of moving white.
The eastern sky is chauging, aud ruby-tinted gold
Spreads o'er tho sleeping valleys and bids the nrsts
unfold;
The fires' smoky headlands move, change from white
to blur>,
And lazy rising upward are lost to nether view.
The crystal dewß are smiling, coquetting with the sun,
80 geutly sweet ere rising, so heart:esi ero he's cone.
The m Ike re' bells are ringing, the Jackass hails tho
morn;
Those spooks of white, much larger, aro circling o'er
tho corn,
80 wary, ever watchful, in silence circling round;
Then from a sun-blcacbed tree top they search the
lower ground.
AU's well 1 In silence dropping they spread upon the
corn,
With two above left watching and at alarm to warn.
The morning sun ia showing bis rim upon the east,
Reflecting on whlto foaihers free in their milky feast.
The farmer still ia waiting—a dozen iv a row,
He'll puil Brown Bess's triggers (both tall) and let her
60.
The birds are feeding nearer; at last ten :n a line,
And resolute on rouidet- he fires the double mine.
Hugo deafening explosion! It drowns the screech of
' pain,l
And thund'ringto the mountain is cchood back again.
Grim satisfaction bonming from his half-hidden face
Ho count* the dozen bodies, curses the feathered race.
The early sun has risen, tho dew hides 'neath the
grass,
The farmer pokes his fires and notes the smoke
wreaths pass;
Whilo far beyond tho corn patch the remnant shining
white
Speed westward for the ranges in panic-aricken
flight;
And as he notes their flying he knows to-morrow's
morn
Wiil brkig them rointorcoments still hungry for his
corn.

'uMARY HOUSE': I was much
interested ito the 75th anniversary pic
tures of the Rockhampton 'Bulletin,'
and enclose a few verses inspired by
recollections of mv childhood home, in
a lonely spot on a tributary of the Hun
ter River, N.S.W. :
Dear home of my youth, I remember it
well,
And the flowers that blossomed o'er
highland and dell!
And it's green hills and cliffs I can
vision today
White flocks of our sheep, ^and the wild
goats at playl
0 crystal-clear stream, oft we bathed
in thy tide,
By springs from the mountain-slopes
? freely supplied,
Or swam near the spray -of a waterfall
clear,
Tree-bordered, descending o'er rock-faces
sheer.
A pastor sought sometimes our house
in the wild,
Whose words. found their mark in the
heart of each child.
Our joys and our sorrows he well under
stood; . '
And his presence alone made us long to
be good. *
There's a spot by the creek-side, that,
more than the rest,
Awakens fair memories, deep in my
breast;
On' three sides there sparkled the
water's pure sheen ;
And purple-trimmed shrubs decked its
carpet of green.
Here tiny birds sang; and there hovered
the bee,
Where parrot-hues lit a great currajong
tree; _^_",The Central Queensland Herald ,"716,394,677,712,714,715,713,715,340,715,76,712,329,715,220,714,255,713,226,715,290,715,90,716,94,715,210,714,364,705,657,719,542,719,361,720,120,719,360,718,290,716,144,715,580",Thu 6 Aug 1936,"5014,5055,5108,5148,5188,5227,5267,5306,5347,5414,5456,5494,5534,5573,5614,5652,5693,5762,5803,5841,5882,5921,5962,6000,6040,6109,6149,6187,6227,6267,6296,3634,3670,3743,3783,3823,3863,3902,3942,3981,4023,4093,4134,4170,4215","2438,2597,2475,2439,2438,2437,2438,2435,2438,2435,2514,2437,2510,2435,2508,2434,2508,2433,2509,2432,2495,2431,2508,2431,2507,2431,2505,2431,2505,2429,2507,3200,3276,3201,3274,3199,3273,3199,3274,3199,3273,3199,3272,3199,3273",70626588,Page 12

At the last II bitrthliko a serpent.
You know where the Puruo begins to spread,
Shallowing iTito a wider bod ;
Despoiling the plain of its proper domain :
Tireiessly wt+.wg its If'«l to guin ; . . . _
Losing itself in devious ways—
Swelling retsistlesfllv, meandering listlettlf,
Till it roaches fh«j Darling's bank.
There il is that my scene is laid ;
Twa« thc-re u desperate i«art 1 played.
* # . #
I had juet come off fioui a seven months' trip,
With a cheque as big as a blanket ;
I had -given the fi rut two than ties the slip :
Th*?4k»^ »»« my fiapiiit, I atopppd fcir_g_
nip,
Another, and then 'twas a case of let rip
To sum it up briefly I drank it.
Ifr was Christmas time, and of course a crowd !
Where in fair and foul weather we'd travelled
together,
And bteo fast chums, d'ye see.
When a man is half inclined to the wrong,
Excuses are easy to seek ;
I know there's a dovil that makes you strong,
When you really were never so weak.
I stayed that day, and the next, and the next,
Just to humour ttio wish of a friend ;
And though at times I was sorely vexed,
'To the day tnfficient the evil,' my text ;
To the devil all care I would send.
And I mocked the pang of the serpent's fang,
That serpent of whom the Israelite sang,
Whose bite is felt at the end.
One night I awoke in delirium's throes,
The dead-house my lodging then ;
Where round me lay moaning and shrieking
and groaning, _ ?
And smiting the walls of their den,
Cursing and ravisjl with biting thirst craving :
For this ! for thu ! they'd been toiling and
slaving ;
My fellow victims, — and men.
I broke through the window in wild affright,
And plunged in the Stygian blackness of
night,
Ah swiftly i-fled on the wiugt-qf-foar; ?
— I i ardent pursuit methooght I could hear ?
Those I had left in the hornd gloom, J
And pestilent air of that stifling room ;
And I thought that they viewed me,
And kradly halkoed ia&
WfattoJuttrl flew as though devils purtaed
On, on, mwtty dashing, through ilgmiu

When next I knew of aught I lay entranced
In deathlike coma, more of death than life ;
Yet conscious of a dim unconsciousness
That wrapped my spirit in a slumberous web
Of pleasurable sloth. And then the veil
Of filmy mist that pent my vision^ flight' ?
mow sundered, showing forth reluot&ntljr ?
A Roene of Lilliputian loveliness.
Wherein all life or. animate or still
Wat vested in harmonious pettiness';
Of forests fair with branching aisles em
bowered,
And fertile glades with flashing tears besprent,
And emerald swards mosaio'd with rich tints
Of flowerets rare that clomb the swelling base
Leading to fairy heights, whence oozed dear
streams
ThatieUinJciroken thraads of dazzling iight; ?
Above, a little assure dome of sky.
Then music sweet as Syren's song arose,
And floated on a perfumed atmosphere.
But white I lay thus steeped in oalm delight
Came uncouth visitors from outer world
With rude and gntteral speech. Then fled my
dream.
I loathed the unwelcome touch of rescuing
hands, *__ ? ?
And would have tHrusiTiHem 'from meTuuTI

BLIGHTED HOPES !
THE friends of King Arthur were quaffing strong
wine,
For they flattor'd themselves that they'd taken
the shine
Out of old Doctor Lang and the Brisbaneites
true,
Who scouted Bill Wentworth's ""Political Stew.""
The Priest and the Parson they had on their side,
And the lovers of freedom they hop'd to divide ;
And bigotry, flattery, money, and fear
Were draw upon - also wine, brandy, and beer.
The cause of the Doctor look'd gloomy indeed,
For tlio joints of the tail of King Arthur, with
speed
To rejoin him, were rushing o'er mountain and
swamp,
All eager to get the place next to the - stump.
The lord of the Swallow had got up his steam,
And grunting rode ouward like one in a dream ;
But with his strong boiler no pressure could cope,
When back'd by the boilers of tallow and soap.
The Earl of Mount Brisbane rode forward in
wrath,
With Bamey O'Keefe and bright Darby McGrath ;
And the Town Marie lawgiver keenly enjoy'd
The eloquent lore of that little love Lloyd ;
While behind him, in station befitting his fame,
The Frenchman who made him a lawgiver carme ¡
And honest Bob Little kept just within view,
With young Tommy Jones and old Pollet Cardew.
All Drayton was shouting and yelling with joy ;
And ""the people"" (five half tipsy men and a
boy,)
Embrac'd, and half smother'd in slaver and
beer,
King Arthur's twelve Knights of the washpool
and shear.
- The battle was over -the polling was past -
And equal the voting for each at the last ;
So ""King Arthur the victor"" they toasted with
pride,
For they knew that the Major was safe on their
side.
Hark ! Hush ! There's a horseman comes gallop-
ing in,
With his sorrowful mouth nearly down to his
chin :
One glance at his visage half opens their eyes,
For they know him as one of their confidant
spies.
""Oh dash down the wine cup !- Be pallid each
nose.
Why paint them so redly to honour your foes?
The Major will vote for King Arthur, 'tis true ;
But his vote isn't worth a brass button to you.""
"" Oh why did you press Dicky Watson to poll,
When you knew that his name had no right on
the roll ?
His vote goes for nothing - myself I could hang
To think that they've got in that Radical Lang !
He has a majority, certain, of one ;
So, in spite of the Major, King Arthur is done :
And still, lest the Doctor's success you won't own,
There's a small rod in pickle for Mister
M'Kono.""",The Moreton Bay Courier ,"525,359,749,75,746,137,744,71,729,746,744,589,726,709,745,83,744,111,710,709,742,746,718,746,94,743,691,665,724,744,689,740,733,746,76,745,76,749,154,675,643,744,85,743,66,746,99,748,122,713,749,80,745,71,700,719,718,706,746,131,736,748,547,736,746,749,148",Sat 3 Jun 1854,"3533,3605,3650,3688,3721,3758,3794,3833,3866,3901,3936,3972,4008,4073,4108,4145,4180,4226,4251,4281,4322,4358,4393,4456,4494,4529,4562,4598,4636,4671,4708,4742,4809,4842,4883,4917,4952,4990,5025,5062,5097,5133,5170,5205,5241,5296,5331,5366,5402,5438,5474,5510,5545,5591,5617,5646,5689,5755,5791,5827,5862,5897,5934,5970,6005,6037,6079","4179,4254,4066,4212,4066,4212,4066,4210,4067,4064,4066,4064,4065,4064,4063,4206,4063,4205,4061,4061,4063,4060,4060,4058,4204,4060,4057,4056,4058,4056,4056,4058,4054,4053,4196,4053,4189,4049,4195,4047,4050,4049,4192,4047,4190,4047,4191,4045,4189,4045,4043,4188,4045,4189,4046,4042,4043,4044,4041,4185,4040,4038,4039,4037,4037,4037,4181",3716310,Page 2

And, searching for a reason, 1

That oysters are in season.""
She smiled a smile that showed this style '
Of badinage rejoiced her, '
And advanced a pace with easy grace
And sniffed the silent oyster! '
The latter's pride was sorely tried,
He thought of what he could say,
Reflected what the common lot
Of vulgar mollusks would say;

Euroka go over the tops of the hill,
For the death-clouds have passed us to-day,
And we'll cry in the dark for the footfalls still,
And the tracks which are fading away !
Let them yell to their lubras, the Bulginbah dogs,
And say how our brothers were slain ;
We shall wipe out our grief in the blood of their chief,
And twenty more dead on the plain---
On the blood sputtered spurs of the plain !
But the low winds sigh,
And the dead leaves fly,
Where our warriors lie,
In the dingo's den-in the white-cedar glen
On the banks of the gloomy Urara !
Urara ! Urara !
On the banks of the gloomy Urara !
The Wallaroos grope through the tufts of the grass,
And crawl to their coverts for fear,
But we'll sit in the ashes ard let them pass
""Where the boomerangs sleep with the spear !
Oh ! our hearts will be lonely and low to-night,
When we think of the hunts of yore ;
And thee foes that we sought, and the fights which we fought,
With those who will battle no more---
""Who will go to the battle no more !
For the dull winds sigh,
And the dead leaves fly,
Where our warriors lie,
In the dingo's den---in the white-cedar glen
On the banks of the gloomy Urara !
Urara ! Urara !
On the banks of the gloomy Urara !
Oh ! the gorges and gullies arc black with crows,
And they feast on the flesh of the brave,
But the forest is loud with the howls of our foes
For those whom they never can save !
Let us crouch with our faces down to our knees,
And hide in the dark of our hair ;
For we will not return where the camp-fires burn,
And see what is smouldering there---
What is smouldering, mouldering there !
Where the sad winds sigh---
The dead leaves fly,
And our warriors lie,
In the dingo s den---in the white-cedar Glen
On the banks of the gloomy Urara !
Urara ! Urara !
On the banks of the gloomy Urara !

Maker of earth and sea, &c.
At the conclusion of the Anthem, the Hon. A. H.
Palmer stepped forward, and on behalf of the Council
of the Association, requested His Excellency the
Governor to open the Exhibition.
His Excellency the Governor then addressing the
assemblage said,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN :-I have seen it stated in
the newspapers that I am to deliver an address, and
I desire to defend myself from aspersions hy
notifying at the very outset that my words shall
be few indeed. It is the more easy for me
to do so, that I have not come muoh about the Exhibi-
tion buildings of late to worry the Commissioners and
interrupt the workmen, so . that many things that I
hope to seo to-day will bo as great novelties, and as
much a surprise to myself as to anyone here present ;
still I think I know enough to be able to congratulate
you upon the variety and qualities of the exhibits
as being wholly unprecedented in both respects in
Queensland. This result has been brought about
not only by our own exertions, but notably through
the good offices of the Bister colonies, Now South
Wales, as the oldest of the group, taking-and deserv-
ing to take-a foremost place. Let me not forget
to mention that Sydney has rendered us an im
, portant service, and given us encouragement in another
1 way. The Central Association is represented in Brisbane
by its experienced and indefatigable secretary, Monsieur
Jules Joubort, who in his kind and genial manner, and
while insisting we had materially helped his society in
the past, when it wanted help, and that one good turn
has been felt to deserve another, has shown UB certain
Bpeoial advantages wo possess for holding such exhi-
bitions, and how we may best apply them. Now,
in conversation tho other . day with Mon-
sieur Joubort, I put it to him that the
objects of a national or central association might
, not be, audi was inclined to believe were not, sufficiently
I appreciated or understood, and that a disposition might
I exist in some quarters to regard it aB a meauB of de
! traoting from tho importance of local exhibitions, so
as to bring all the benefit or "" kudoB"" to tho capital.
Monsiour Joubert'B rejoinder was that in the neigbour
ing territory a similar objection had been taken
at the outset, but that such places as, for
instance, Singleton, soon came to see how useful it
waB to them to have a recognised centre of competition
where a staudard of superior .fitness or quality should
periodically bo raised in the sight of all the country
This observation, of courso, applies to agricultural auc
pastoral exhibits only, for iu respect of wha
I may call town industries, und of tho depart
ment of the fine arts, there can nowhere
be any contention as to the locality in which
such productions ought to be brought together for
submission to a final test You scarcely need to be
reminded of the difficulty ef selecting for the purposes
of a general exhibition such a time of year as should
do equal justice to all the interests claiming to be
represented within the limits of Bowen Park. Thus the
season that may suit the exhibitor of stock may not suit
the agriculturist and gardener ; and again, should the
shearing season have arrived the appearance put in on
behalf of ono of our most prominent staples must neces-
sarily he incomplete. Add to such drawbacks the long
distances to be travelled, and the as yet imperfect
means of rapid transport, and I think you will agree
that all things considered, we, Queenslanders, may
felicitate ourselves upon what has been achieved as a
first attempt, and may hopefully look forward to still
more satisfactory results being obtained when once we
have felt our way. Ia conclusion, may I ask the question
what more substantial advantage the statesman or the
Eatriot could desire than that by such means as are
ere afforded each of the competing colonies should be
brought to see wherein its strength lay, for is it not the
I case that when this was seen, a healthy and altogether
! friendly rivalry would follow; nay, a general union
would be speedily established upon foundations that
should endure long after Border duties and other Cus-
toms exactions were things of the forgotten past.
His Excellency then formally declared the Exhibition
to be opened, and read a congratulatory message from
New South Wales.
The general public were then admitted, and the mem-
bers of the Musical Union Bang the opening hymn, by
Mr. J. Brunton Stephens.
While nations joining gifts
Their fanes of Art adorn,
Hear, Lord, the lowly voice that lifts
The song of the youngest-born.
The gifts of the youngest-born.
We snread them forth to Thee,
What toll hath wrought, what skill hath taught,
What Freedom hath brought the free.
No storied name we vaunt,
Nor martial trophies raise ; '
No battle-riven banners flaunt
The triumphs of other days.
But triumphs of peaceful days
Adorn our jubilee ;
Hero toll and skill Thine ends fulfil.
With hands that from blood are free.
We pile the arms of Poace,
Her trophies manifold,
Her ploughshare swords, her shields of fleece,
Uer armour of bloodless gold.
Our treasuros of fleece and gold
We consecrate to Thee,
With choicest yield of fruitful field.
And spoil from the forest-tree.
We bless Thee for bur land,
Broad streams and gladdening rills,
For flocks that roam on ev'ry hand,
For herds on a thousand hills.
From all its thousand hills
Our land doth call to Thee,
Still do Thou bless with happiness
This youngest of the free.
It is calculated that moro than fifteen thousand per-
sons (iuoluding thoso who had the privilege of entree
before the opening) were admitted through the arch in
tho centre of the gateway in Gregory Terrace, and
through the various turn-stiles, during the day.

Nottno the demise of the Oreenock Adver
tiser, a paper started in 1802, the Christian
Leader tays the most notable incident in its
history, next to the fact that it died twice, was
its rejection of one of the finest poems of
Campbell, sent by the youthful author of "" The
Pleasures of Hope "" for insertion in the poets'
corner. The editor put in a notice to the poet
that his attempt was not ""up to the mark' 1 of
the Advertiser.
It is interesting, from the philological point
of view, to learn from the Indian native papers
that native visitors to England are accused by
their countrymen of helping to degrade the
Oriental languages on their return. It is
alleged to be "" their general habit to speak the
English language ana to anglicise the verna
cular ;"" their speech abounds with "" samples
of .hybridism, and the most ludicrous murder

lated Hindustani. ""—Athenmtm.

BY JAMES II.,
KING OF SCOTLAND.
(FROM THE TRANSMITTER.)
The banquet o'er, the Scottish monarch drew
The Douglas forth into a distant room,
Which overlooked the ga den down below
Then quoth the King, "" Good Earl, wilt thou
renounce
The dark designs thou'st .nourished 'gainst our
life, ;
And let fond friendship re unite our hands,
And mem'ries of .the past forever fade?
Think of thy sires, who, with the gallant Bruce,
Fought side by side through many bloody
strifes;
Remember him, the feared by Southron foe,
Who, far away on arid Easte. n plains
Obtained thy badge-the mighty crimson heart
An emblem of his truth and loyalty.
Then thou, a member of this noble race
Thou, whom we'd love to cherish as a friend,
A friend whom nought but death alone could
part,
Thus turn your back on Scotland and her King,
And, by thy harsh and heartless conduct, give
An entrance to a foreign enemy/*
"" Not so,"" replied the fierce and angry earl,
""The blame lies with thyself, and thou shalt
gain
The guerdon of.thine own unworthy deeds.
Thy hand has wrought the evil to this land,
And on thee let ;the"" consequences fallí""
A shadow o'er the sovereign's features passed ;
The veins stood but like cords upon his brow;
The words that would his angry thoughts ex-
press,
Broke inarticulate within his throat.
He bit his lip'and turned his face away
To see if guards or menials were about.
Not one was there save grim'Sir Patrick Gray,
Who, motionless like some gaunt statue,' stood,
His armor gleaming in the ruddy light
Cast through the window by tho settin ; sun.
His hands were resting on the lengthy shaft
Of his old friend, a sturdy battle-axe.
When James thus viewed that knight so close at
hand
(Whom well he knew was yearning"" for revenge .
Upon his deadly foe, the Douglas Earl)
He drew a sparkling poniard from his belt,
And ere the Earl could guess his foul intent,
He dealt on him a swift and deadly blow.
Sir Patrick, startled by the sudden noise,
Rushed forward with his weapon poised aloft,
And on the prostrate body of the Earl
He ended what his master had begun.

been tried on a larger scale. The following
communication received yesterday will prove
that it has been adopted with signal success in
the direction of Tahiti s-]
' Dear Sister,-I am sad to hear
'' That your affairs are rather queer.
1 I'm told a certain brawling chief
Has"" caused Your Majesty much grief;
"" It being his malicious aim
i To set your nation in a flame.
» - Yet, notwithstanding this was known,
' The people who surround your throne,
4 .While through the land his treasons rung,
i i Did not know how to stop his tongue.
' And many-many months went by
Ere they could, as they call it, try ;
"" ' And others even followed them
> '' Before they managed to condemn.
- i And after that, as I am told,
When you had of that varlet hold,
t i While all your Judges gravely chid,
I s He only laughed at what they did.
v At ease his mirthful hours were spent ;
Your people taxed to pay his rent ;
And, while he feathered well his nest,
V ~ Your laws and you were made his jest.
Still you, my Sister, were content
With this burlesque on punishment ;
But he, I hear, preferred a writ,
. That is, said he would not submit ;
At least without, these were his words,
""A battle with the House of Lords.""
And, next, I find their lordships saw
..It-right to ask about the law,....
And seven judges vowed that he
WHS not entitled to be free ;
' While two said they could not speak poz,
But thought upon the whole be was.
The matter being thus perplext,
, It to the House of Lords came next ;
L There all the peer« were push'd aside.
For five old lawyers to decide}
When three declared for him, and two
Voted, as is called, for you.
AU this is right, the English throng
May say, but I pronounce it wrong ;
Ridiculous it seems to me
Yow rule should be ""the Rule of Three.""
Since it is thus-since three grim Whigs
Can thus oontrire to run their rigs,
Your Majesty, by such odd tricks,
Must feel that you are in a fix,
If three, who ure disposed to rail
At justice, can so far prevail
That they may laugh to scorn all others,
And mack a score of learned brothers,
' Tis plain that law in your poor land
Only a few can understand.
^ With law, too, reason must decay,
If not already passed away.
Since we see, in this iron time,
Impunity extend to crime,
Of course, your gentle heart must chafe.
And feel you're not exactly safe.
Be off while you can choose and pick ;
Your Majesty must cut your stick.
If you make up your mind to roam,
Tahiti offers you a home.
Here no such trash can e'er obtain
As that which sends you o'er the main ;
Since your war fleet no more defends
From those who prove they are not friends.
A squadron of my grand Canoes
I'll order to confound your ibes ;
Arid, better (ban ii doubtful throne,
A royal hut shall be your own.
; Come, then, Oh Queen-lose little time
In passing to a happier clime,
Where men, though called uncivilized,
Are still afraid to be despised
For spurning, on some mean pretence,
AH that appears like common sense,
And then affect, with sacred awe,
' To laud the dignity of law.
Haste, then, Victoria-pass the sea,
And join your sister

I
WILL not pay
Twopence to ride a little way.
* A very little way, I say,
A hundred yards it may
Be, in a tram!
Nor will I lend
My money to a friend.
To spend
On things I can't afford
To buy myself.
I will not shout
For any one, without
I suffer drought
In my interior
Economy.
I will not play
At bridge, and say,
'You take the bun!
See what you've done!
You are to blame!
You threw away the game!""
And let my face
Get red.
Nor eat to please
The cook, if she's
The sort
Who thinks you ought
To court
A dose of indigestion
In suicidal appreciation
Of her accomplishments.
I will not growl
Because my neighbour's fowl
Begins to crow,
To let me know
The moon is up
At half-past two.

Hot Air""
v\7E know by this that politics
Are full of strange surprises;
That reputations have been made
In all sorts of disguises.
There was a man who couldn't write
A sentence of dictation.
And he became in course of time
A Minister for Education.
Another, too, who couldn't tell
A turnip from a vulture;
And 'erstwhile he devekmed as
A Minister for Agriculture.
And quite a lot of similar
Instances could be quoted.
Where little men have suddenly
To office been promoted.
When things like this occur, well, then,
Give over all surmises.
Remembering the simple fact
That hot air always rises.
Nomenclature.
T.TE goes to thfi races at times, and
although only a small bettor, ver
seldom gets on a winner. He Is the pos-
sessor of a refined literary taste, and
to him all words are sources and foun-
tains of meaning.
His soul rebels at the outrageous
and lugubrious names that many of
the horses race under, so that, in no
circumstances, however good a horse
may be, and however strongly he may
consider its chances, if it has an inane
name he will not take a ticket on it
He prefers to lose his money on a well
named animal rather than encourage
preposterous nomenclature by backing
animals with uncouth"" names.
""Why can't they give horses some-
thing like the appropriate names they
give ships?"" he asks. ""Take that fine,
modern steamer the Manunda for ex-
ample. There we have, under a soft
sounding name, in a slightly disguised
form, it is> true, but still plain enough
for any one to discern, a recognition
of the fact that steamers these days
are not controlled from the bridge but
from the stokehole-not by the cap-
tain, but by the man under.""
Latest Fashions.
rpHE hair will be long and the dresses
shorter.
For this is the mandate of Fashion
to-day
Regarding the dresses, it's held that
they orter
Be shortly abolished, as things in tbo
way.
But be not afraid it will leave the
young ladies
As barely equipped as, let us say,
bowsers,
Already at seaside consortings the flap,
pers
Are strolling around in a blouse and
a trousers.
And what will become of the Lords of
Creation
In days that will come is a matter
of guesses;
Though It looks very like, to preserve
the distinction,
The Lords of Creation .will have to
wear dresses.
But still it may happen that out of
the conflict
There may come a truce in the mat
ter of swathing,
And each, at a conference, agree to
abide by
The costume at present they use in
the bathing.
Launch Guests.
SPRIGGS is a natty man. He likes
to have everything on his launch
trim and clean. He spends a lot of his
spare time polishing It up. Although
he is by nature a hospitable fellow, with
a desire to share his pleasures with his
friends, he now firmly declines to in-
vite any of them down the Bay for
a week-end's fishing.
""The last couple of fellows I asked,""
he says, ""quite cured me of the habit.
They walked all over the boat for two
days with muddy or sandy boots.
They scaled their fish on the seats.
They threw prawns' heads and rancid
worms all over the floors. Again and
again I tidied her up and implored
them not to make a fish and chips
rubbish bin out of the craft.
"" 'Don't worry,' they said, 'we'll clean
her up as spick and span as a new
pin when we get back to the anchor-
age!'
""But the anchor was scarcely down
when they were in the dingy with their
tackle and catch, and the lad rowing
them ashore. After we had cleaned up,
the boy and I started for home, heavily
laden with the portables.
""Tiley dashed past us in a taxi, bound
fpr the station, gaily waving their
hands to us.
""And they were fellows you'd think
better of.. But they're all allkel""",The Brisbane Courier ,"265,209,487,38,227,490,420,403,243,245,365,141,395,236,253,342,263,228,147,234,298,320,377,286,470,258,132,279,290,135,363,139,335,381,395,258,459,242,260,256,278,563,599,533,616,618,617,618,617,620,389,584,617,617,618,619,100,586,617,618,618,615,617,238,582,616,617,618,617,236,583,618,617,618,142,195,534,469,539,392,587,382,536,422,477,395,491,443,412,426,519,400,616,364,489,410,296,616,522,619,619,616,284,587,618,618,620,618,619,611,605,620,619,474,586,618,618,618,604,618,616,617,617,618,615,451,346,621,118,589,101,624,158,589,67,621,204,589,127,614,64,593,163,621,131,590,171,620,238,589,207,621,184,575,253,621,137,590,191,337,622,540,619,622,624,623,612,621,324,588,621,624,621,622,621,621,622,622,469,590,621,619,73,589,621,624,624,622,391,596,622,198,591,527",Sat 11 Jan 1930,"285,416,522,602,593,621,651,680,710,768,796,826,855,884,942,971,1001,1030,1061,1118,1146,1174,1206,1235,1264,1294,1324,1380,1410,1440,1469,1499,1528,1556,1585,1643,1673,1702,1730,1760,1789,1842,1913,1946,1975,2005,2034,2063,2092,2122,2152,2181,2210,2241,2270,2298,2328,2357,2385,2416,2445,2473,2503,2533,2562,2591,2620,2650,2679,2709,2738,2767,2796,2827,2858,2909,2975,3014,3050,3082,3144,3174,3206,3237,3300,3332,3363,3393,3456,3487,3519,3550,3611,3642,3674,3705,3761,3834,3868,3900,3931,3962,3993,4025,4057,4088,4120,4153,4184,4214,4244,4274,4306,4334,4365,4393,4425,4456,4487,4517,4547,4578,4608,4638,4669,4698,4753,4824,4857,4885,4915,4945,4974,5003,5038,5091,5122,5150,5180,5209,5244,5268,5297,5356,5385,5415,5445,5473,5503,5532,5562,5619,5650,5679,5709,5738,5767,5797,5826,5881,5951,5984,6013,6044,6072,6102,6132,6161,6191,6220,6249,6278,6309,6339,6368,6398,6426,6457,6485,6515,6545,6575,6604,6634,6663,6693,6723,6753,6781,6810,6841,6870,6900,6929","1830,1862,1718,1656,1714,1732,1704,1731,1794,1655,1653,1717,1655,1717,1655,1654,1655,1655,1717,1655,1653,1664,1655,1655,1654,1654,1717,1654,1654,1655,1654,1655,1654,1653,1717,1655,1654,1654,1654,1654,1716,1681,1658,1739,1655,1656,1654,1654,1656,1653,1654,1687,1656,1655,1655,1655,1654,1686,1656,1657,1655,1658,1655,1655,1687,1656,1656,1656,1655,1654,1688,1654,1656,1655,1656,1868,1659,1738,1660,1738,1659,1739,1662,1740,1661,1739,1660,1737,1660,1739,1660,1738,1662,1741,1660,1739,1818,1661,1739,1657,1656,1658,1659,1690,1659,1659,1659,1659,1659,1660,1659,1659,1660,1657,1691,1659,1659,1659,1658,1656,1658,1658,1658,1657,1656,1655,1787,1653,1779,1683,1748,1652,1749,1684,1748,1653,1748,1686,1748,1652,1748,1684,1749,1654,1750,1686,1748,1654,1749,1685,1749,1653,1750,1684,1749,1654,1750,1684,1750,1791,1652,1733,1653,1650,1648,1651,1650,1650,1651,1682,1649,1649,1647,1647,1649,1648,1648,1650,1647,1678,1648,1649,1648,1680,1648,1646,1648,1650,1649,1676,1649,1649,1679,1660",21512811,Page 18

FOR
THE QUEEN'S BIRTH-DAY, 1814.
BY MR. M. ROBINSON.
IN Early GREECE, when War no more,
With Aspect wild, deform'd her Shore;
Nor longer on the tented Plain
Swell'd the shrill Clangor's martial Strain,
Proud to retrace their native Soil,
Her Swains retir'd to rural Toil ;
To Scenes which oft in fond Review
Fancy's sweet Illusions drew ;
Add there the crippled Warrior told
Of Battles won by Prowess bold;
Of hair-breadth 'Scapes on hostile Ground,
Of Comrades scarr'd with many a Wound ;
Then Industry, with busy Hand,
Rester'd the long neglected Land,
And Shepherds sung, while Peasants toil'd,
Till Vales with waving Plenty smil'd :—
For hush'd was howling Discord's baleful Train,
The Olive bloom'd, and Peace proclaim'd her Reign !
And then the graceful Muses found
Their sacred Haunts on classic Ground ;
What Time their HOMER'S magic Page,
Enlightning, charm'd a wond'ring Age,
Form'd the bold Theme, and, with aspiring Strain,
Sung ILIUM'S Fall — and mourn'd her Heroes slain.
Then ATHENS saw her rising Day
Illum'd by Wisdoms's spreading Ray,
And Arts, and Science, hand in hand,
Advance progressive o'er the Land.
The Painter's Skill, the Sculptor's Toil,
Bade Genius venerate the Soil :—
Hence splendid Structures rose on high,
Whose polish'd Columns reach'd the Sky;
And ample Domes, and hallow'd Fames,
Where Piety inspir'd seraphic Strains:—
Temples, where Truth shone forth with radiant Rays,
And swelling Choirs prolong'd the Notes of Praise.
But tho' rude Time, that with relentless Sway
Bids ""cloud-cap't Tow'rs"" and stately Domes
decay,
Has levell'd all those Monuments of Taste,
And Ruins, only, mark the wilder'd Waste;
Still shall fair Wisdom's Page uninjur'd stand,
Still brave the Wreck of Time's impairing Hand ;
And ancient GREECE one Meed of Glory claim,
To raise her Annals high in story'd Fame ;
Whilst faithful Mem'ry pauses to review
The brightest Æra polish'd ATHENS knew!
When her enlighten'd Seers of old,
Skill'd in prophetic Lore, foretold
That o'er the Western Main an Isle
Should flourish under FREEDOM's Smile ;
Whose mighty KINGS, thro' Times unborn,
The regal Sceptre should adorn ;
Whose CONSORTS, form'd with Virtues rare,
Should prosper — HEAV'N's peculiar Care ;
Whose august Race, by kindred Worth ally'd,
Should rise the Hope, and prove the Nation's
Pride.
THAT ISLE has flourish'd, eminent in Fame,
Supreme in Arms, and ALBION IS HER NAME !
ALBION ! on whose distinguish'd Heroes brave,
Illustrious Wreaths of blooming Laurels wave :
Such as left NELSON's Name renown'd in Story,
And now embellish WELLINGTON's with Glory!
Hence has the Muse, with vent'rous Lay,
Aspir'd to sing this halcyon Day,
And bade her humble Lyre proclaim
Thro' distant Climes, OUR CHARLOTTE's
NAME.
From chilling Zembla's snow-cap't Lands,
To sultry Afric's burning Sands ;
From Pole to Pole the Trump of Fame
Swells the proud Note to CHARLOTTE's
NAME !
ILLUSTRIOUS QUEEN ! exalted WIFE!
Ador'd thro' ev'ry Stage of Life ;
By Nature's Impulse taught to share
THY CONSORT's ling'ring Hours of Care.
And when consuming Sickness spread
Pale Terrors o'er His drooping Head ;
When trembling Hope could scarcely dare
To snatch one Respite from Despair,
'Twas THINE to charm with Sympathy's sweet
Pow'r,
Trace the faint Gleam, and watch the doubtful
Hour,
'Twas THINE with fond Solicitude to prove
Duty was Friendship — and that Friendship, Love.
FROM THY EXAMPLE SHALL THE WORLD
RECEIVE
A RICHER BOON than DIADEMS COULD GIVE !
NEW SOUTH WALES, }
Jan. 18, 1814. }
This day a cart was stopped on the Parramatta
Road, and robbed of a chest of tea ; and a few
days ago Mr. S. Larkin was stopped on the same
road, on horseback, by three footpads, who robbed
him of £6 sterling.
From our Correspondent at Hobart Town we are
happy to learn that the wheat harvest, which com-
menced at Pitt-water the 26th ult. and shortly after
became general, bore a very fine and promising ap-
pearance; an article of information that will be the
more generally acceptable to us as our own crops
have been severely injured by droughts, the long
prevalency of which we scarcely recollect a previous
instance of. The first who began reaping was a
young settler of the name of Reardon, formerly of
Norfolk Island. The crop of barley had been un-
commonly productive, and potatoes, and vegetables
in general, afforded an abundant prospect. The
improved and progressively improving condition of
the various species of stock, was highly grati-
fying.
We have much to regret the loss on the passage
of twenty out of 20 horses and mares shipped
from hence in the Eliza, Captain Murray, for Ho-
bart Town.
The Lady Nelson, from Norfolk Island, with
salted pork and mutton, had arrived, and was in
Frederick Henry Bay when the Elizabeth came
away.
The following articles of information, are copied
from the latest London Papers received :—
Among the most remarkable articles in the late
American papers, is one stating, that on the 27th
of March the Success, of and from Boston to Ca-
diz, was captured by the French frigate Arethuse,
and sunk; the French Captain at the same time ex-
pressing his regret at having fallen in with her, as
he said his orders were positive, to destroy all Ame-
rican vessels on such a destination. So much for
""the liberty of the seas,"" and His Imperial Majes-
""ty's love for the Americans !""
Mr. Justice Grose is said to have at length retired
from the Court of King's Bench; and is to be suc-
ceeded, according to report by Mr. Dampier.
In June last, J. Wiltshire and C. Conolly were
committed to Exeter, from thence to be conveyed
to London, to be tried at the next Admiralty Ses-
sions, for aiding and abetting His Majesty's enemies
on the high seas.—These men were taken in a vessel
that had been captured and manned by the True
Blooded Yankee, privateer.
The following most extraordinary circumstance is
mentioned in a letter from Edinburgh :— A gentle-
man of respectability, in the medical profession,
cut his throat on the 12th of June, in that city —
Immediately before he committed suicide, it is said
he wrote a paper, in which he acknowledged that
he was the person who robbed and murdered Beg-
bie, the porter, some years ago. It is remarkable,
that when the body of Begbie was examined after
the murder, the surgeons expressed an opinion,
from the nature of the wound, that the assassin was
a person of anatomical knowledge.
The Cornwall paper of Saturday says, that the
Prussian ship Wilhelm Gustaff, which arrived at
Falmouth on Monday (June 20), from Bourdeaux,
brought over passenger Madame Moreau, the wife
of the French General. This lady had returned to
France, from America, for the benefit of her health,
but the French Government would not allow her to
remain in France, in consequence of which she has
come over to England.",The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser ,"202,77,840,481,818,771,599,809,653,637,703,570,700,655,844,832,644,654,844,785,926,979,689,777,776,982,981,984,662,720,747,680,775,661,781,822,774,738,987,985,891,942,186,848,865,880,938,941,813,781,845,683,664,687,805,851,637,883,832,894,939,114,872,987,933,919,988,980,803,635,703,944,154,820,639,758,941,163,814,642,708,856,716,730,821,708,939,120,939,113,850,937,939,291,1001,470,393,943,982,993,985,369,940,987,983,990,986,986,989,986,1000,984,978,980,977,986,981,106,932,977,977,213,935,981,979,106,937,827,933,975,961,977,961,977,986,986,970,609,936,983,877,930,981,982,982,979,980,533,940,979,980,984,979,987,973,985,984,984,985,659,945,985,985,987,989,989,987,988,424",Sat 22 Jan 1814,"490,596,648,766,860,901,951,989,1042,1090,1133,1182,1224,1273,1310,1362,1411,1459,1496,1549,1592,1636,1729,1772,1824,1872,1913,1962,2052,2100,2147,2196,2239,2285,2331,2378,2426,2472,2514,2562,2655,2703,2757,2794,2842,2883,2930,2978,3026,3073,3116,3205,3258,3303,3347,3392,3443,3486,3533,3573,3623,3680,3713,3760,3851,3901,3945,3992,4085,4137,4180,4221,4283,4362,4414,4458,4498,4558,4640,4691,4737,4777,4874,4920,4966,5013,5115,5173,5204,5265,5300,5345,5448,5513,5539,5634,5682,5799,5841,5889,5933,5990,6027,6072,6116,6165,6209,6263,6301,6346,483,520,566,616,662,706,753,815,852,893,940,997,1029,1077,1128,1192,1263,1314,1355,1402,1451,1498,1544,1591,1637,1682,1728,1781,1818,1871,1916,1964,2006,2057,2102,2148,2195,2251,2285,2333,2383,2428,2472,2516,2565,2611,2656,2708,2751,2802,2837,2889,2937,2981,3028,3075,3122,3166,3222","1866,1922,1539,1719,1511,1578,1509,1509,1513,1512,1509,1509,1508,1507,1506,1508,1504,1506,1503,1502,1463,1457,1503,1502,1503,1469,1461,1458,1505,1509,1511,1509,1507,1506,1508,1506,1506,1506,1457,1458,1505,1502,1549,1502,1502,1504,1503,1504,1503,1502,1503,1505,1504,1503,1507,1506,1505,1506,1507,1507,1509,1556,1461,1463,1471,1468,1465,1471,1508,1509,1512,1504,1551,1505,1503,1504,1506,1554,1509,1506,1506,1504,1507,1504,1506,1499,1499,1549,1498,1547,1496,1498,1496,1435,1435,1452,1524,1497,1456,1454,1458,1458,1505,1460,1463,1458,1458,1465,1462,1463,2464,2487,2489,2485,2487,2486,2484,2484,2533,2485,2486,2487,2529,2484,2486,2482,2527,2483,2530,2485,2483,2481,2480,2481,2485,2486,2487,2486,2533,2490,2489,2541,2490,2491,2491,2491,2492,2493,2534,2491,2492,2490,2492,2488,2488,2488,2490,2488,2488,2485,2530,2489,2488,2487,2485,2487,2488,2486,2487",628848,Page 2

In Memoriam
ROBERT BROWNING.
ALICE HAM.
The world's great teacher laid aside his pen,
Bowed his white head, and passed beyond our ken
To the eternal verities; and yet no death
Can rob us of him, since the throbbing breath
Of life immortal pulsates through his words,
That noble music set in deepest chords.
The why and wherefore of this life of ours
He read, while other poets pressed its flowers.
Beyond the problems of all time and place,
Steadfast, he saw the shining of a Face.
His work being done, he passed with trust replete

because bo' theught it M'Donall'd duty, as a Govern»
ment officer, to tako proceeding». Never spoke to de-!

Defendant was rather the worse for liquor. Cross
examined by Mr. Blackmore : 1 say positivelylnod do.
literately that defendant' used"" these words.,
He spoke in English and not in"" Gorman.'
Think that 'Henry "" Mao must' have ' hoard

very loud Any one over the watch-house might have'
heard him. Did not look to seo if any policeman was'

been talking to ono or two people beforo laying tbs in-.'
'formation. Have never stated that I would got every
Roman ' Catholic sent to prison under this

John F. M'Donall, chief officer of Customs at

Cook bocamo ona of thoso illustrious bands'of mon, nc

John, Franklin, who- had frequent opportunities of
hearing tho opinions of captains and admirals of tho

resolution sa ably proposed by Dr. Lang/: Ho was suro
tho result of the movemont would be .great success in
the ' erection. of. thia memorial.' We could' soarcoly:
rjaliso tho difficulty this great < navigator - had
in accomplishing what I ho did. Sotting sail ? from

was romarkabto that ho should have succeeded,- It was

had marbles from Gladstono nnd tho county of Argyle,
equal to thoso of Spain.. ; Mr. Hovell know that They

WORDS OF PARTING.
Oh, -what shall I do, dear,
In the conning years, I wonder,
When our paths which lie so sweetly near,
Shall He so far asunder?
Oh, what shall I do, dear,
Through all the sad to-morrows,
When the sunny smile has ceased to cheer
That smiles away my sorrows?
What sinai 1 I do, my friend,
When you are gone for ever?
, My heart its eager need will send
Through the years, to find you never.
And how will lt be with you,

Nobody makes me crosser than Maisie,
Her soul is fat conceited, and lazy;
To-day ""You're stupid, or else you're wicked.""
I thought, and thinking it, something clicked;
A gateway opened, terribly small.
The whole me couldn't get in at all;
I left my usual self behind,
And wandered freely in Maisie's mind.
I saw her carpets and furniture,
Her window-boxes (and to be sure,
Her pansies don't make much of a showing,
But I never guessed that she liked them
growing);
And if her windows are far too small,
She's only a tenant, after all,
No alterations and scant repairs!
I saw her steep, narrow, corkscrew stairs,
And the place where the oilcloth's worn clean
out--
No wonder she doesn't like running about.
It wouldn't be safe in a soul like that,
And her padded armchairs conduce to fat.
I liked them, though-it was fun to see.
Click! I was back in the usual me,
Out of breath, but I feel much fonder
Of Maisie, now that I've been up yonder.

One last salute; and then the long farewell!
Sad silence of the Old Man Eloquent!
The Soul, expatriate, strikes its time-bleached tent,
Departing, in the Farther Land to dwell.
Not flawless, it may be, the record stands —
He was but mortal. Yet, true Citizen,
All his long life he served, with speech and pen,
His Country, not himself; and with clean hands,
Empty of lucre, he waves Adieu to men.

THE WAND OF GOD.
There were dust and heat on the ridges.
There were starving stock on the
plain;
The long lagoons were death traps,
Whose- live prey strove in vain.
There were clouds' in the sultry heavens.
Rolling al^n^ each day.
O'er the smoke of hungry bush-fir-?s.
Where the long-dry grasses lay.
Tough bueJimcn fought for their cattle.
Tireless, game, and grim;
And the Trnreen worked and waited,
And joked when hope was dim.
Bla^k days: Till, at last— the deluge '?
The lowering storm-clouds buipt.
Lifting tho pall of sorrow
That lay on a laid aceuret.
WhHt could be svrpptcr mu^ir.
Than the sound of the niching rain;
Filling the swamns ami gullies,
Flocvlin^ the thirsty vliin'.1
Cleansing the heart of BiifTV.ng.
Easing the weary brain !
Row fair is tiie altered land?--ap-\
One short month after rain!
The TTand °f a Master Paini-v
Ha* touched the ridge and plain,
Clothing them, as by magic.
In sofest green again.
C'.eav from thp scrub and paddock
Crimes the call of browsing kino:
And the fat calf stirs the. rushes,
''Ncith flowering lawyer-vine.
r'r.o rinn-dove coos by the river;
Tiie magpie nests and sings-,
Pr' 'Tii grassy swamps in the hollow
CnMio=. the whirr 'f wild-durks' wings.
What 'cares the blue crane fishing.1
'Tis horses, racing fast.
In -ieer delight of living,
isow drought, and want ave past.
Onco more, beside the myrtle,
The wild hog roots content:
The snowy blood-wood blossom'.
With parrots' hues are blent.
The sandal woods beneath them
Their creamy earpet shed,
And tea-trees vroo the water
With blooms of white and red.
The bear looks down from his arm
ch aii
On. deep lagoons below.
Where the blwk swan sails serenely,
And sweet blue lilies blow.
There arc powers of good and evil,
Vet dream not life is vain ;
And O! whilst the land is smiling
Thank God for Jlis j-ift of rain.

RETROSPECT.
'Tis in the night that memory throws
Over the soul her holy light:
Refllection cometh ere repose,
All in the night!
Beings of many a bygone year
Arise and wander through the brain!
The loved, the lost, the dead appear,
In solemn train!
""There is a tide,"" we know, ""with men""--
Have we embraced it at the flow?
Will it return to us again,
Or never so?
Although the gift were Fortune's least,
Had we received it--not refused--
It might have pleasantly increased,
Being well used.
Have we then trifled with our days,
Or hath the talent beent concealed?
Much to lament, and less to praise,
Doth Memory yield.
I know not if the use of thought
In me hath good or had effect;
But my heart sighs, with sorrow fraught--
""Ah, Retrospect!""
Yet I love dwelling on the gone,
And not on the departing, day--
The future gliding gently on,
With me away!

which I procured, thilnking of course, of getting
the cash on delivety ; but the uentlanman whlen he
had got the boots on, stamped about tile shup in
lthem, saidl they fitted well, walked to the door and
said when going, that hlie would pay mue to.n-orrovw,
never before lhaving mentioned that hIe wanted
credit. I sent to himn several times for the money,
anl he denied the debt, sayinlg It was his brother.
Under these circulnstanees, [ was comllhelled to sue
him in tile Court of Requests, where I obtained a
verdict aid aferwards is.ued execution. After this
he evaded payment, by telling tile bailiff it was not
hhlin, and tile man was afraid to arrest hiin, not
being in possession' of his chrlistian name, I was
therefore necessitated to en withl tihe man nsyself.
and when he was arresfed, left him and the bailiff
to settle it. and I obtained the money from tile court
this day. Bhut I have to show you that, if he is to
be belIeverd, it was something worse thnn poverty,
that has been the cause of his not paying me ere
now,for he has since condescended to favor tle with
the followinlg polite specimen of letter-writing.

T HE Remaining BRIGHTON ALLOT
MENTS, varying in size from Four to Forty
Acres.
A. P., contrary to his usual custom, will intrude
a few remarks,in order to point out to
Newly-arrived Emigrants
the advantage these Allotments hold out, far beyond
any that have ever yet been offered by him in his
public capacity to an indulgent public. In the first
place, he could point out that when, in a former
advertisement, he foretold the fortunes that lay
ready to any person willing to sink a portion of
their surplus capital, it was treated as a PUFF
DIRECT; and however hurtful sutch insinuations
were to his feelings, he suppressed them, fully
assured that his words would be .verified. That
they have been so, the fortunate Purchasers of
The Brighton Allotments,
in the latter part of 1836, can and would readily
testify; and as a further proof, if any be required.
look at the splendid Villas about being erected and
springing up in every direction.
""THE EXECUTORS,""
with a view of benefitting the community at large,
have determined on disposing of the remainder of
these delightfully situated Allotments, on the day
previously named, on such advantageous Terms,
that even to the UNINTEItRESTrED (if there be any),
it will raise in their minds a desire to obtain a
portion of this most invaluable Property; which,in
a few years will'prove; that in a rising Colony like
this, property of any other description must, in
point of speculation, decrease in value, when placed
in competition with that of Land, especially when
situated within so short a distance of the
Metropolis.
A. POLACK feels confident that the Public will
appreciate the slight ,EULOGUtxs he has passed on
these ALLOTMENTS, and on the day of Sale will not
fail to secure to themselves, what in a short period
must make them and their offspring independents
To Gentlemen in public and private offices,
Speculators in Land, Capitalists, Builders, Market
Gardeners, Dairymen, and Others,
The Brighton Alotments
hold out the certain prospect of i' Wealth without
labour, independence without care ;"" for not only
will thle terms of payment favour the purchaser, by
the. gradual and almost imperceptible manner in
which they will be made, but the soil is of such an
alluvial nature, as must produce the most beautiful
crops, the exhilirating effects of whlich will manifest
themselves in the countenances of the fortunate

SONNET.
And this is Mount Victoria, glorious scene!
Flow on ye fountains of my heart, o'erflow
In floods of bliss, and glow intensely glow
In gratitude my soul— now, now I've seen
Heav'ns work divine, as tears had never been !
On either hand along the mountain's brow
Are those the ruin'd castles in a row,
Deep wooded vales and browsing herds between,
Where dwelt the mighty in the days of old—
The giants of the earth when earth was young,
Unfading garland on the brow of time,
Dark forest, whose wild glens I now behold :
How from the mind the world at once is flung,
As perched on high we view thy scenes

Welcome home, Astraeas 1 I have looked
for your work in vain.
I liked your poem, 'Peace,' and read
your pars in Eve's Domain.
Dear Eves, may ev'ry carking care with |
the old year pass away,
And may the new year bring you all
a joy to bless each day.
You meant but au revoir, 'Rex '2
Don't leave us in the lurch.
'Tis good for hen conventions to be
argued off the perch;
And Adam helps the focus and im
proves an outlook small:
Best greetings from a sister scribe,
brave brothers, to you all.
The old year passes swiftly, the young
year comes apace,
And smilinsr, points to the clean page
to be filled with deeds of grace.
Grieve not for bygone failures; the
riddle is hard to guess,
But a try is one step nearer the goal
that means success.
A trues to the world depression; we
each can do our share
To lighten a weight of sorrow that
someone has to bear.
May the good old earth be brighter for
the way we wield the peu,
And may we work with a right good
will till Christmas comes again.

By Kathleen Dalziel.
There is a way, in the mist-veiled
summer valleys,
Where the voice of the trees
intones a muted psalm,
Where the tired torrent takes
breath awhile and dallies
In a haven of leafy calm.
Where the sky is a roof of cloudy
opal over
The columned hills, and the air
is sharp as wine,
And the coral fern and the crimson
bramble cover
The bird-pool under the pine.
Little disturbs the peace there, and
there by inches
The noonday sunlight follows the
winding path,
Till all the way is sunlight, and the
finches
Scatter their silver bath.
Where the moulding log retrieves
her green with mosses,
And the mountain myrtle leans
up to bluer air,
And the wavering spray in a
drifting rainbow crosses
The rifts of maiden-hair.
And memory weaves a charm about
the bracken,
For its earth made holy with
sweetness overpast,
With the sanctity of our first kiss
shyly taken,
And the sadness of our last.",The Australasian ,"436,389,618,279,586,415,622,452,451,623,170,588,373,621,254,531,620,275,583,248,621,116,452,623,410,588,272,620,435,444,620,225,582,339,616,222,496",Sat 6 Jul 1929,"1891,1956,2018,2058,2088,2125,2157,2192,2226,2289,2326,2360,2395,2427,2463,2498,2559,2597,2630,2665,2699,2734,2768,2832,2867,2902,2936,2969,3005,3040,3104,3138,3172,3209,3240,3276,3311","2063,2089,1988,2053,2021,2086,1985,2050,2019,1984,2058,2020,2030,1985,2054,2019,1986,2055,2020,2088,1987,2055,2020,1985,2052,2019,2086,1985,2053,2018,1984,2052,2020,2091,1988,2052,2022",141394989,Page 51

""The Blue Mountains,"" an Invitation.
COME to the Mountains, Blue Mountains, Blue
Mountains,
Come to the Mountains this lovely spring day,
To see crisp runnels and bright little fountains,
Bubbling and gushing and hurrying away !
Come to the Mountains, to see the spring flowers,
The wattle, the tea tree, the heath in bloom,
To quaff the fresh breeze that blows through their
bowers,
Refreshing the sense and sowing perfume !
Come to the Mountains, to look on the forest,
Spread out like a cushion beneath your feet,
To look on the monstrous crags, where thou soarest,
O Eagle, to render the awe complete !
Come to the Mountains, to gaze down the gorges,
Huge bays with their sealess expanse tree-lined,
To learn how the waterfall roars and surges,
And drifts its spray with the will of the wind !
Come to the Mountains, to hunt for a valley,
Deep down in the breast of a rifted hill,
With a shade of woven tree-top3, and gaily
Bedizened with ferns round each drip and rill !
Come to the Mountains, to roam on the Mountains,
The Blue Mountains you see so far away,
If it is but to hear our careless fountains,
O ye who toil in the city all day.

SIR,
If you think the following lines are worthy a corner
in the Sydney Gazette, by inserting them you will
oblige
A CONSTANT READER
THE PRAISE OF WOMEN.
Happy that man must pass his life,
If free'd from matrimonial chains;
Who is directed by a wife,
Is sure to suffer for his pains.
What tongue is able to unfold,
The falsehood that in women dwell;
The worth in women you behold,
Is almost imperceptible.
Adam could find no solid peace,
When Eve was given for a mate--
Till he beheld a woman's face,
Adam was in a happy state.
For in the female race appear,
Hypocrisy, deceit, and pride;
Truth, darling of a heart sincere,
In woman never can reside.
They're always studying to employ
Their time in malice and in lies;
Their leisure hours in virtuous joy
To spend, ne'er in their thoughts arise.
Destruction take the man I say,
Who makes a woman his delight;
Who no regard to women pay,
Keeps reason ever in his sight.
Reader.--In women's praise! O fie, 'twill vex,
And is a stigma on the sex.

consequence he had placed several tins
containing plants at either entrance to

Tan minister said last night, says he,
"" Don't be afraid of givin' ;
If your life ain't worth nothin' to other folks,
Way, what'B the use of livin' ?""
And that's what I say to my wife, says I,
There's Brown, the mis'rable sinner,
He'd sooner a beggar would starve than give
A cent towards buying a dinner.
I tell you our minister is prime, he is,
But I couldn't quite determine,
When I heard him a givin' it right and left,
Just who was hit by his sermon.
Of course there couldn't be no mistake
When he talked of long-winded prayin',
For Peters and Johnson they sat and scowled
At every word he was sayin'.
And the minister ho went on to say,
.'There's various ninds of cheatin',
And religion's as good for every day
As it is to briug to meetin'.
I don't think much of the man that gives
The loud amens at my preachin',
And spends his time the followin' week
In cheatin' au^ overreachin'.""
I guess that dose was bitter enough
For a man like Jones to swallow ;
But I noticed he didn't open his mouth,
Not once, after that, to holler;
Hurrah, says I, for the minister
Of course I said it quieir
Give us some more of this open talk,
It's very refreshin' diet.
The minister hit 'em every time,
Aud -when he spoke of fashion,
And riggin's out in bows and things,
As woman's rulin' passion,
And coming to church to see the styles,
I couldn't help a-winkin'
And a-nudgin' my wife, and says I, "" That's you,""
Aud I guess it sot her thinkin'.
Says I to myself that sermon's pat,
But man is a queer creation,
And I'm much afraid that most of the folks
""Won't take the application.
Now, if hf had said a word about
My personal mode of sinnin',
I'd have gone to work to right myself,
And not set there a-grinuin'.
Just then the minister says, says he,
"" And now I've come to the fellers
""Who've lost this shower by usin' their friends
As a sort o' moral umbrellas ;
Go home,"" says he, "" and find your faults,
Instead of huutin' your brothers',
Go home,"" says he, ""and wear the coats
You tried t® fit for others.""
My wife she nudged, and Brown he winked,
And there was lots o' smilin',
And lots o' lookin' at our pew,
It sot my blood a-bilin'.
Says I to myself our minister
Is gettin' a little bitter,
I'll tell him when the meetin's out, that I
Ain't at all that kind of a cribter.",Australian Town and Country Journal ,"797,754,535,897,621,828,732,883,646,764,637,867,660,783,796,896,578,719,686,730,554,825,665,781,589,711,679,799,616,639,487,752,479,658,622,727,527,788,491,965,628,700,568,881,546,670,579,754,567,722,681,892,586,826,672,789,549,871,577,600,471,594,471,834,668",Sat 30 Sep 1876,"453,593,636,679,722,765,808,850,893,970,1014,1056,1099,1142,1184,1228,1271,1350,1392,1435,1478,1521,1564,1607,1650,1729,1773,1816,1859,1902,1946,1986,2030,2107,2150,2193,2238,2278,2323,2364,2408,2485,2529,2569,2615,2657,2695,2742,2787,2862,2906,2949,2994,3034,3078,3120,3165,3240,3288,3334,3375,3417,3461,3498,3546","3974,3910,3955,3911,3955,3910,3956,3912,3955,3912,3955,3914,3958,3914,3957,3915,3959,3915,3956,3915,3959,3915,3960,3915,3960,3915,3957,3913,3957,3912,3960,3914,3957,3915,3958,3914,3958,3914,3959,3913,3957,3914,3960,3915,3960,3914,3962,3915,3959,3915,3958,3914,3957,3915,3956,3914,3958,3913,3960,3914,3960,3916,3963,3918,3962",70604691,Page 24

Oh ! why should it be that in this fair world of
ours ?
Man with man for ever warring — and with the
vile weapon
Slander. — Why should this gorgon dwell amongst
us ? —
This hideous fiend, by whose envenom'd breath
The heart's blood may be chilled — the best af-
fections crush'd :
So crush'd and blighted that they ne'er can bloom
again !
Are there who never knew what 'tis to feel thy
sting,
Relentless harpy ? — to writhe in anguish at thy
cruel tortures ?
Oh, happy they ! though few they be I ween ;
But yet methought that only from amongst the
young —
The gay — the happy, thou didst choose thy
victims.
But now it seems, nor age, nor honest worth —
Howe'er retiring ; nor the declining past of life
Well spent in praise of nature's God,
Can shield us from thy with'ring shafts !

tent day are the roost popnUr performers at the mu-io
halls. Leotard soil A volo are more highly esteemed
than the most accomplished tvnor. It is littlo' moro
than a century tinco the toan was thoroughly excited'
by the teats of a Simson of the day. It was just at
the time when Admiral Vernon bait achieved a great
naval victory by the reduction of Porto Hallo, and tho
capture of the waptrt ol Gtrthairena tn Spain, whiob.
last evenly in these days of slow trtvelling, took mor»
than a mot.th in reaching England. A man named
Topham^celèbrated tor his muscular power, determined
to take advan'age of the oacasioo, and nnnouoced in
honour of the viotory a grand trial of strength.
On the 28tb of May, 1741, the performance caros off
in the thorou/bfjre now Known as Bmh-street, Olerkno
woll.in which street three hoisboads of water, together
neighing 1836 pound J, were placed on a timber frame.
Standing abate them, Topham, by means uf a stirrup
e'er bia shoulder, fustened to a strong cord, contrived
to lift the cambrons load several inches, in tho presence;
ot Admiral Vernon himself, who had mingled with tho
orowd. The performance became sn popular th.t T""p
baui's portrait was frequently on signboards in and
about the metropolis. Though only about live feet ten
inches in height, this man's atrenzo was indeed extra,
ordinary. He oould pull against a boise «itb bis feet
placed against a low wall, roll up a pewter dish with his
flngor*,. and lift with his teeth a titile six feet long,
wuh a half-hundred waight attached. He valued
himself, however, on other aocorap ishments ; for ha
was aeqtiaintel wiih music, and bia biographer heard
him sing a solo to the organ of bl. Wedbuigh Ohurob,
Deiby. He adds that ""his voice, more teirible than
eweer, so'toed scarce human;"" and also that ""the
ostler of the Virgin's Inn having given bim some causa
of dieplvasu-e, be took une of ibo kitoiieu epils and beut
it roand hts neck like a handkerchief."" It is »Iso re-
corded of him that one night, perceiving a watchman,
asl-ep inhu box, he raised both from the ground, and

And many an easer eye
Had ranged, a hungry rover,
From patties down to pie;
""When, while all tongues were vying
In buoyant bursts of glee,
I heard denr Dolly crying,
""O, will you wish with me?""
A touch of something tender,
A nature without blot,
A friend's and foe's defender
That's Dolly to a dot!
Just fancy what came o'er me,
As with lips half a-pout,
This sweet one stood before me
And held a ""wish-bone"" out.
Bright was the bone and brittle,
A bonnie bone, in fine;

And, lo! the wish was minc

It was o'er the tall Pine, on the brow of the mountain, / The dew-drops distill'd from their crystalline fountain;
When the first tint of morning in purple hues flushing, / O'er Heav'ns arch'd canopy, radiantly blushing;
As her bosom expanded with sweets to be press'd, / The breeze of Aurora, the heath flower kiss'd;
And bore on its wings the rich odours that rose, / To the bright bed of Ocean, where the silver wave flows.
Queen of the cheerful smile! shall I meet thee / In the moss-grown cave wild, that looks o'er the sea? / Shall I press to my heart, thy sweet beauties yet dawning, / Which rival in lustre, the brightness of morning?
The blue face of the sky, when the sun beams are dancing,
Look not more serene, than thy bright blue eye glancing;
The wild honey's sweetness ever dwells on thy lips,
Which the bee in his course fain would linger to sip!
Ah! no--the rude billows between us are dashing,
And a far-distant coast, these wild waves are washing
Where the maid of the South her bower has implanted,
And left me to mourn for the charms that enchanted.
No more I may see her, her lot may be brighter,
Other friends may be dear, other scenes may delight her;
Then ""Peace to that heart tho' another's it be,
""And health to that cheek, tho' it blooms not for me!""

Down the avenue of days
Tranquil eyed, and very calm,
Knowing all of passion's worth,

Heavy hearted, blind with tears,

For the myriad woes of earth.

Through many a shady dell,
Where summer wind-breaths dally,
And bright-plumed songsters dwell,
Ever murmuring onward floweth
Our own old Quaen-bein,
Whilst sea-ward fast it goeth
Through wild-woods ever green.
High up where Jingera frowneth
In grandeur hoary and lone,
And near where the white gum crowneth
Old Tindera's lofty cone.
The live-long day it singeth
The moss-green crags among,
And aloft its bright spray flingeth
Where the water-lilies throng.
In boyhood oft I've wandered
By its turfy, shrub-fringed banks;
And near where its course meandered
Through the green flags' serried ranks,
I've watched the shy teal gliding
'Neath the steep rock's mossy ledges,
Or anon, when startled, hiding
Among the tall green sedges.
And when eve's cool dews had spangled
The glistening forest leaves,
And gleaming globules dangled
From our village cottage eaves,
I've listened to the chimings
Of its wavelets' silvery song,
Like distant fairy rhymings
Borne dulcetly along.
Then flow on, dear old river!
Glide swiftly to the sea;
Anon where green myalls quiver
Thy silvery track shall be:
Still though thy waters mingle
With broad streams on thy course,
I'll love each dell and dingle
Around thy woody source.

Dear to my soul, too early lost;
Affection's arm was weak to save,
The love of justice, friendship's boast-
Has come to an untimely garve.
That gentle bosom— now is cold,
Where vestal justice ever glow'd,
Lies crumbling down to common mould,
That heart where love and truth abode.
He died, deserving to be mourn'd,
As witness all the tears we gave,
My God! that He who life adorn'd
Should die, and fools in folly live.
O who shall blame the heart that feels,
When Heaven resumes the good it gives,
Or who shall chide the tear that falls,
From friendship's eye, on Kinchela's grave?
Farewell, John Kinchela, to thy tomb
My silent footsteps oft shall stray ;
More dear to me its hallowed gloom,
Than life's broad glare, and fortune's day.
Ne'er shall the thoughts of the depart;
Nor shall my soul regret resign,
Till memory perish, till this heart.

Spring is tripping through the meadows, Spring is laugh-
ing on the hills,
Wakening with her touch the flowers, and brightening
with her smile the rills.
Like a glorious bride She cometh, whose fair bridesmaids
are the Hours,
Her soft cheek with blushes mantling, and her bright
hair wreathed with flowers.
Halt In hope and half ta fear of all the things that she
shall know,
Kow her face with smiles Is beaming, down her cheek the
toars now How.
Sweet smiles, blissful tears, awakening germs of joys and
flowers to llfo,
Grief were almost but a seeming, since In sorrow joy Is
rife.

"" There is sorrow ou the sea; it cannot be quiet.""-JES,
xlix, 23.
The recent naval catastrophe brings to mind
many distressing occurrences of a 3imilar charac
ter daring recent years-among such disasters
the loss of the Eurydice, which is described else
where, will be remembered by many persons. The
following lines were written by Captain Hare,
who went down with the ship, and the MS. of the
poem was found in that officer's desk by a diver at
work on the wreck olí the Isle of Wight :
I stood on the shore of tho beautiful sea,
And the billows were rolling wild and free ;
Onward they carno with unfailing force,
Then backward turnod in their restless course.
Ever and over they rose and fell,
With heaving and surging and mighty swell ;
Ever and ever sounded their roar,
Foaming and dashing against the shore.
In summer and winter, by night and by day,
Through cloud and sunshine holding their sway ;
And deep seemed calling aloud to deep,
Lest the murmuring waves should fall asleep.
Oh, when shall the ocean'ß troubled breast
Calmly and quietly sink into rest ?
When shall tho waves' wild murmurs cease,
A.nd the mighty watara be hushed in peace ?
It cannot bo quiet ; it cannot rest ;
There must bo heaving on ocean's breast ;
Tho tide must ebb, and tho tide must flow,
Whilst tho changing Boasons como and go.
Still from the depths of that hidden shore
There aro treasures tossed up along the shore,
Tossed by the billows, then seized again,
Carried away b v the rushing main.
Oh, strangely glorious and beautiful sea !
Sounding for ever mysteriously !
Why are thy billows still rolling on
With that wild, and ead, and musical tone ?
Why is there never repose for thee ?
Why slumberest thou not, O mighty sea ?
Then the ooean's voice I seemed to hear,
Mournfully, solemnly sounding near.
Like a wail sent up from the caves below,
Fraught with dark memories of human woe,
Telling of loved ones buried there,
Of the dying shriek and tho dying prayer ;
Telling of hearts still watching in vain ?
For those who shall never come back again ;
Of the widow's grave and the orphan's cry,
And the mother's speechless agony.
Oh, no ! the ocean can nover rest
With such secrets hidden within its breast.
There is sorrow written upon the sea,
And dark and stormy its waves must be.
It cannot be quiet, it cannot sleep,
Thi3 dark, relentless, and stormy deep.
But a day shall come, a blessed day,
When earthly sorrow shall pass away,
When the hour of anguish shall turn to peace,
And even the roar of tho waves shall cease ;
Then from out its deepest, darkest bed
Old Oooan shall render up its dead,
And, freed from tho weight of human woes,
Shall quickly sink in its last repose.
No sorrow shall ever bo written then
In the depths of the sea or tho hearts of men ;
But Heaven and earth renewed shall shine,
All olothed in glory and light divine.
Then where shall the billows of ocean be ?
Gone, for in heaven shall be no more sea.
'Tia a bright and beautiful thing of earth,
But cannot share in the soul's new birth ;
Its life is of murmur, and tossing, and spray,
And at resting-time it must pass away.
But, oh ! thou glorious and beautiful sea,
There is health, and joy, and blessing in thee.
Solemnly, sweetly, I hear thy voice
Bidding me weep and yet rejoice
Weep for the loved ones' buried beneath,
Rejoice in Him who has conquered death ;
Weep for the sorrowing and tempest-tossed,
Rejoice in Him who has saved the lost;
Weep for the sin, the sorrow, tho Btrife,
Rejoice in the hope of eternal life !",Australian Town and Country Journal ,"680,1018,138,1009,1035,1051,1037,1048,1052,1051,1054,866,805,847,774,913,635,884,657,791,877,954,773,890,837,675,855,872,686,817,838,828,823,886,801,678,800,624,693,862,704,809,790,721,811,867,671,828,1048,867,846,693,642,853,732,790,684,762,711,747,916,870,761,688,850,704,719,911,848,729,834,810,824,813,883,764,816,908,691,641,801,834,870,778,791,685",Sat 1 Jul 1893,"2034,2147,2182,2262,2307,2352,2398,2442,2488,2533,2578,2624,2680,2721,2761,2803,2842,2882,2923,2964,3004,3045,3085,3125,3166,3207,3248,3289,3329,3370,3410,3450,3491,3531,3572,3612,3653,3694,3735,3775,3817,3857,3898,3939,3980,4020,4061,4100,4142,4182,4222,4264,4304,4344,4385,4427,4467,4508,4548,4589,4629,4670,4711,4750,4791,4832,4873,4913,4954,4995,5035,5075,5116,5156,5197,5238,5278,5318,5359,5400,5440,5481,5521,5562,5602,5643","3783,3627,3591,3639,3593,3595,3594,3597,3595,3596,3595,3597,3597,3598,3598,3598,3602,3601,3597,3598,3597,3597,3596,3595,3597,3597,3596,3599,3597,3597,3598,3597,3599,3599,3599,3599,3598,3599,3597,3598,3596,3598,3596,3596,3595,3595,3596,3595,3595,3594,3594,3594,3594,3594,3594,3593,3593,3593,3592,3592,3592,3592,3593,3592,3592,3593,3592,3592,3591,3591,3592,3592,3594,3593,3593,3593,3593,3593,3593,3593,3597,3592,3592,3591,3592,3592",71186058,Page 31

The Empty Ring.
HENRY BYAD.
A little prattling child at play
Beside its mother's knee
Her jewelled rings had drawn away
and three;
Unchid—one, two, three;
Ruby and emerald and pearl,
la golden circlets gay,
AM given to her, when but a girl,
By friend i now far away.
And, as lie aakol each giver's namo,
And where they all were now,
With her left hand upraised, the dome
Shaded her caddened brow.
To reach her lifted haud he tried
With sudden merry spring:
"" Give me, oh give mo that,"" he cried;
"" Give mo your empty ring.""
At her son's word tho mother smiled,
Then drew him on hor knee,
And suiid: "" Thi.i empty ring, my child,
Your father gave to mo,
And it is lt'led all round its rim
With gems you caunot see—
Hid love to mo, and miue to him,
And love of both to thee.""",The Queenslander ,"756,482,495,233,489,391,575,231,483,472,359,539,410,586,485,627,442,531,450,624,465,607,460,643,392,518,460,537,430",Sat 14 Apr 1888,"350,657,792,1737,882,912,945,981,1016,1017,1046,1077,1112,1167,1202,1233,1268,1301,1334,1362,1402,1455,1490,1523,1557,1589,1625,1657,1690","542,641,636,1071,567,602,567,910,600,567,598,567,597,567,597,567,597,567,597,567,598,567,600,567,600,567,600,567,597",19931771,Page 569

REMINISCENT.
To-night the gates are flung ajar
Where past beleaguered precincts are;
Late Is the hour as I go hence
To memory's haunted monuments.
I pass the way where youth dreams lent
To me a glad environment,
Then onward through a lapse of years,
Along the path of sighs and tears.
Out of tile roses maiden wove
A crown her brow to wear above,
But found a viper hid beneath
Tho blossoms of her bridal-wreath.
This is the acre of love's tomb,
And vain ambition's catacomb
Ashes and dust! No grief retrieves
The blush upon the blighted leaves!
Here in my life there came to me
A dawn of happy prophecy;
I wore a laurel wreath one day,
Then sorrow tock the boen away.
Flowers and joyous hymral song
Of birds to summer time belong.
Yet low upon this haunted tomb
A robin sings 'mid lily bloom.

See yonder line of famished beasts
In search of scanty water ;
The splintered hoof but onward hastes
'Midst burning stones to clatter.
The sunken eye the wild dog frights ;
The panting sides so hollow
Will scarcely feed the carrion kites
On ragged wings that follow.
No limpid pool to quench your thirst
Lies cool in gum trees shadow,
But scorching winds and blinding dust
Your fainting footsteps follow.
No pastures green by silver stream,
No ehady groveB invite them hither ;

Orpheus.
To the Editor.
SIB,-I lately read in an old newspaper an account of
the loss of H.M.S. Orpheus, on the coast of New Zea
land, in 1863, and as that sad event was sourrounded
with painfully interesting circumstances, I have writ
ten the following lines, and should you consider them
worth insertion, their publication will recal to
mind an instance of herioc bravery and discipline for
which our seamen have ever been famed :
The Southern Cross illumed the sky on that eventful
morning,
Above, in heaven's canopy, its boundless vault adorn
ing.
When off New Zealand's lofty land, darkness around
prevailing,
With merry crew-a gallant band, a stately ship was
sailing.
And when the sun on wings of light proclaimed the
morn of day,
The gallant Orpheus, - out of night, comes sailing on
her way.
Onward she speeds, a lovely sight, her spars the royals '
bending, ? '».?
Like some glad bird with pinions white o'er waves of
ocean wending.
""The land's in sight I"" with mountains bold-in joy
the cry was given, -
Upon the sea a path of gold that seemed to lead to
heaven.
The sentry viewed the cheerful sight, while to his
messmates hailing
""My lads, we'll rest in port to-day-the port to
which we're sailing.""
While thus they gazed on visions new, bold hills the
coast defining,
Death raised a landmark to their view of cliffs with
Bilvery lining.
They cast the lead, but little knew that there they
sought their grave.
Where now the sad-the wild sea-mew, cries mournful
o'er the wave.
The boatswain gave his orders shrill, calling the men -
to quarters.
They all obeyed, as if on drill, amidst the surging
waters.
! The mountains back the echo sent from» caverns deep
and wide, .
! The cry "" We're lost !"" in breakers rent, with rocka on
every side.
They stood like men prepared to die, the ship from
rocks rebounding, ;.
Trembling as though in agony, with signal-gun re
sounding.
They faltered not, the signal given that shook the
empty air,
Was heard aloft in vaulted heaven-they found a
harbour there.
Then Burnett cried, "" Let yards be manned !"" as up
the shrouds he led, ,\ '
But Fate was in supreme command, with the roll
call for the dead.
1 The light of Heaven shone bright and clear upon tho
brave and dying, .
The crew went down with British cheer, with all their
colours flying.
* # # # * # «
Loudly and mournfully wailed the wind, as aloft their
spirits flew, .'
Britannia wept, in grief resigned, and sighed a last
adieu.

Meetings of settlers continue to be held in
various parts of the colony (Bays the ALBURY BANNER)
for the discussion of the important question of land re
form, and for the purpose of determining the particular
amendments necessary to promote settlement upon
the waste lands of the Crown. - At a meeting held a
few days since at Young, the following resolutions
were adopted :-"" 1. That this meeting is of opinion
that an amendment of the present Land Act is re
quired, such amendment to embody the following prin
ciples :-That the interest on the balance of condi
tional purchases be abolished, and that such balances
be reduced by annual payments of one shilling per
acre. That a compulsory Fencing Act be passed.
That the improvement clause be abolished. 2. That
a Free Selectors' Association be now formed for the
purpose of uniting with other associations of a like
character, with the object of carrying out the fore
going resolution.""
On Thursday night an accident occurred (says
the ROCKHAMPTON BULLETIN of the 4th instant), on
the new unopened section of the Northern railway,
about four miles from Dingo. The night was dark,
and nothing could be seen at any distance. A ballast
engine, with several waggons attached, was coming
down the line at a moderate speed, when a young bul
lock, which had been standing by the side of the rail,
suddenly got on the line, a few yards in advance of the
train. As it was impossible to stop the engine in time,
it was hoped that the animal would be caught by the
cow-catcher in the usual way, and thrown aside ; but
something different happened this time, for the bullock
got underneath, and the engine and tender, after a
rough ride over the carcase, came down again on the
metals, having escaped with two broken springs, be
sides a little other damage. The waggons, two of
which were injured, left the rails, but the engine waa -
soon afterwards brought to a standstill. One of the
waggons contained a number of women and children,
who were getting a "" lift ;"" but the danger on thia
occasion will make them cautious for the future as to
riding in the dark.
The Archbishop of Canterbury (""says the Times)
has determined upon holding a Fan-Anglican Synod at
Lambeth Palace in the autumn of 1878, and with that
view has recently been in communication with the
whole of the English, Irish, colonial, missionary, and
Scottish bishops, with a view to ascertain whether
they acquiesce in the propriety of the proposed Synod,
and whether they will attend it. The Archbishop of
York, the Bishops of London, Llandaff, Lichfield,
Oxford, and Chester approve, and will attend.
Many express doubts, but will attend. The
Bishops of Winchester, Norwich, and Peterborough
disapprove. All the Scottish bishops approve, with
the exception of Dr. Christopher ""Wordsworth, Bishop
of St. Andrews, who doubts. Only one Irish
bishop (Cashel) disapproves. All the colonial and
missionary bishops who have replied to the Archbishop
approve, with the exception of Sierra Leone, Welling
ton, and Nelson. None of them positively say they
Will attend, but three-Nelson, Wellington, and New
Zealand-say they will not attend. Of the American
bishops, twenty-eight say they approve, but five-New
Jersey (Dr. Odenheimer), Western New York (Dr.
Close), Virginia (Dr. Whittle), Vermont (Dr. Bossel),
and assistant. New Jersey (Dr. Scarborough)-disap
prove, and will not attend. Amongst many subjects
which thc Archbishop proposes for consideration are
""Book of Common Prayer and authorised Version of
the Bible,"" ""Doubts and Fears,"" "" Counteraction of
""The Eastern Church/ "" Old Catholics and Scandi
navian Church,"" ""Unity among Catholics of the

--o--
TANNA is one of the largest islands in
group known as the New Hebrides. The
natives of it in common with all their
South Sea brethern, are generally titled
by the whites ' Cannachas.' They are
of the negro family, resembling in fea-
ture, very closely, the Feejee tribes . It
is said that they believe in the existence
of a Superior Being, whose earthly
dwelling they fancy is in the burning
volcanoes for which the island is remark-
able. They believe in a future happy
state, and call their heaven 'Arrochin.'
They are divided into small tribes or
clans; the largest of these are the
Ukingha-shaa and Attanam families. A
spirit of rivalry between these two last
mentioned often causes long and bloody
wars all over the island.
Tanna besids the never-sleeping volcano,
has its other objects of interest in the
many boiling springs that surround the
base of the burning mountain. Some
of these are held as holy, and none but
chiefs are permitted to taste their
waters. Such restriction, however, does
not extend over all.
When any of their great warriors die,
the aborigines believe that the spirits of
Arrochin prepare a great feast there for
their coming guest, and for fear he
should loose himself on the road thither
they (the spirits) call to him and blow
trumpets, sending some one at the same
time with torches to meet him and
guide him on his way to those blessed
regions.
THE 'CANNACHA'S' DEATH-SONG, OVER HIS CHIEFTAIN.
Shades of my father, the hour is approaching.
Prepare ye the 'cava' for 'Yona' on high ;
Make ready the welcome, ye souls of Arrochin,
The Death God of Tanna speaks-Yona mustdie.
No more will he traverse the flame sheeted moun-
tain,
To lead forth his brothers to hunting and war ;
No more will he drink from the time honour'd
fountain,
Nor rise in the councils of Uking-a-shaa.
His voice in the battle loud thunder resembling,
Has died like a Zephyr o'errunning the plain ;
His whoop like the tempest thro' forest trees
trembling,
Shall never strike foemen with terror again.
The ' muska' hung up on the cocoa is sleeping
And Attanam's spirits have gather'd a-nigh,
To see their destroyer ; and wailing and weeping,
Roll past on the night breathing winds of the
sky.
The lines are suspended, the ' muttow' is broken,
The canoe's far away from the waterwash'd
shore,
Mourn, mourn, ye ' whyeena's,' the word has been
spoken,
The Chieftain can bring ye the 'weepan' no
more.
Ye cloudseated visions, ye shades of my fathers,
Awake from your slumbers, the trumpet blast
blow ;
The moments are flying, the mountain mist gathers,
And Yona is leaving his campfire below.
The struggles are over, the cords are asunder ;
Ye Phantoms hold forward your heavenly light,
Speak on the wings of the sky-shaking thunder,
And fill him with joy on the path of his flight.
Come downwards a space thro' the fogs till ye
meet him,
Throw open the doors of Arrochin awide,
And stand on the thresholds, ye Shadows to greet,
him--
The glory of Tanna, the Uking'shaa's pride.
Thanks, spirits departed-heard I not your voices
Faint rolling along on the breath of the gale ?
Thanks, spirits departed, Le-en-na rejoices :
Ye've answered the mourner-ye've silenc'd
the wail.
The midnight is clearing; the Death-song is ended,
The Chieftain has gone, but ye've call'd him
away;
For he smiled as he listened, obedient ascended,
The voice in his ear, and the torch on his way.

THE TEAR.
When friendship or love
Our sympathies move ;
When truth, in a glance, shall appear,
The lips may beguile,
With a dimple or smile,
But the test of affection's a tear.
Too oft is a smile
But the hypocrlte's wile,
To mark detestation or fear :
Give me the soft sigh,
While the soul-telling eye
Is dlmm'd, for a time, with a tear.
Mild charity's glow,
To us mortals below,
Shows the soul from barbarity clear ;
Compassion will melt
Where this virtue is felt,
As its disc is diffus'd in a tear.
The man doom'd to sail
With the blast of the gale,
Through billows majestic to steer,
As he lends o'er the wave,
Which may soon be his grave,
The green sparkles bright with a tear.
The soldier braves death,
For a fanciful wreath,
In glory's romantic career ;
But he raises the foe,
In battle laid low,
And bathes every wound with a tear.
If with high bounding pride
He returns to his bride,
Renouncing the gore-crimsoned spear,
All his toils are repaid,
When embracing the maid,
From her eyelid he kisses the tear.
Sweet scene of my youth,
Seat of friendship and truth
Where love chas'd each fast-fleeting year ;
Loath to leave thee I mourn'd,
For a last look I turn'd,
But thy spire was scarce seen through a tear.
Though my vows I can pour
To my lov'd one no more,
My Mary, to love once so dear ;
In the shade of her bower,
I remember the hour
She rewarded those vows with a tear.
By another possess'd,
May she live ever bless'd,
Her name still my heart must revere ;
With a sigh I resign
What I once thought was mine,
Or forget her deceit with a tear.
Ye friends of my heart,
E'er from you I part,
This hope to my breast is most near,
If again we should meet
In this rural retreat,
May we meet, as we part, with a tear.
When my soul wings her flight
To the regions of light,
And my corse shall recline on its bier,
As ye pass by the tomb,
Where my ashes consume,
Oh ! moisten their dust with a tear.
May no marble bestow
The splendour of woe,
Which the children of vanity rear ;
No fiction of fame
Shall blazon my name,
All I ask — all I wish — is a tear.",Launceston Examiner ,"596,273,387,363,597,335,371,511,270,386,453,346,401,536,312,321,571,329,383,478,365,414,527,414,466,592,395,338,425,333,283,582,450,371,599,362,424,542,405,441,665,479,369,693,443,398,501,419,323,584,329,400,589,309,491,501,369,328,566,382,316,600,477,360,588,376,409,555,354,352,550,294,350,493",Sat 28 May 1842,"666,742,774,807,843,877,910,943,987,1020,1050,1085,1118,1150,1198,1230,1263,1296,1327,1360,1404,1437,1470,1503,1534,1568,1608,1643,1677,1707,1742,1776,1821,1854,1890,1920,1954,1985,2031,2063,2095,2129,2162,2194,2239,2273,2305,2338,2372,2406,2452,2482,2517,2551,2584,2616,2661,2695,2726,2760,2793,2827,2868,2902,2933,2968,3000,3034,3075,3109,3141,3173,3208,3240","398,565,455,459,384,459,459,391,458,459,385,459,459,388,462,462,391,462,460,388,461,460,387,461,460,386,458,460,390,464,465,393,467,467,395,467,467,395,466,465,392,465,466,398,466,467,397,470,471,398,471,472,400,471,471,401,473,476,404,477,478,403,473,473,403,472,471,401,470,470,399,472,472,400",36248626,Page 6

Your toil is fruitless if you seek it here;
'Tis an exotic of celestial birth,
And never blooms but in celestial air.

The fairies live in garden flowers,
As doth the caterpillar;
The mignonette a cottage is,
A larkspur is a villa.
In rose-trees' old embattled walls
Proud fairy earls are dwelling;
Campanulas are churches tall,
Where bells the hours are telling.
Acanthus flowers let out as flats,
Whose tennants are erratic;
I knew an artist fay who climbed
Twelve stories to his attic.
And there's a fairy architect
A curious gift discloses,
Restoring most artistic homes
From ruinous moss-roses.

L. N.
TRAMPING along the lonely track,
Winding through the forest timber,
When early sunbeams mild and tender
Glance on the rude swag upon the back;
While the day is young prem onwards,
Keep the inarch up in good style;
The next station 11m far forward,
Over many a weary mile.
Over ridge and gully and grassy plain,
The miles grow longer as the son attends;
The shoulders under their burden bend-
Before the road stretches ever the same.
Now the sun has reached its highest noon,
A brief halt in the shifting shade awhile:
No water nearer than the next lagoon,
Farther on many a weary mile.
Up and away—there is no time to loiter—
. The day's journey is but half way through;
The tired feet have further work to do
Era they reach the hospitable shelter.
Now comes a horseman hastening by;
The question he answers with a smile—
"" How far away doea the station lie V
Alas 1 still some odd weary miles.
How the way lengthens, how the limbs drag I
And still no sign of a habitation—
Still on every side the forest's vegetation;
The daylight lessens, let not the footsteps flag;
And when, as the sun sinks in the west,
In sight appears the wbbed-for aisle,
A joyful cry escapes from the breast.
To Bud an end to the weary miles.

of sixty on a clear, bright, frosty morning carry

will not see it.
When thb¥ Bsonr to Dbink.—During the
hearing of a case in the Court of Exchequer,
Dublin, the judge asked a witness, "" How soon
do people begin to drink in your part of the
country—at what age?"" Serjeant Armstrong:
"" I can answer that —as soon as they are born.""
(Laughter.) The witness: ""At all ages, my
lord."" His lordship: "" That is jtut what I was
afraid of: he says they begin at all ages.""
Sergeant Armstrong: "" Oh, yes, my lord, I
know a part of the country where the day a
child is born the people bleed it in the feet, and
impart a glass of whisky.""
PbescbiptioKs.—A physician, who was not
Tery familiar with the symptoms or the remedies
for the cholera, was called upon to prescribe for a
cobbler, who believed himeelf suffering from
the epidemic. He told him to take certain
medicines, and called again next day, when he
was told that Crispin was cured ; in fact, so well
was he, that he had gono to work. —"" Indeed !""
said the doctor; "" that is capital. You see my
prescription has answered admirably.""—"" Not
so,"" they answered; he would not take the
medicine.""—"" Indeed! What then did he do ?""
—"" Impatient and hungry, he called for his
supper—a dish of beans and potatoes, along
with a red herring.""—"" Dear, dear !"" exolaimed
our doctor ; and bettering he had discovered a
secret which Nature, by chance, had revealed,'
he drew out his pocket-book, and wrote the
following as a cure for cholera: "" Cholera Pre
scription.—Beans, cold potatoes, and red her
rings ; to be taken plentifully and immediately.""
But a few^lays elapsed, and our good doctor
was called in to attend a mason, also seized with
the cholera, to whom he at once gave the famous
prescription. Alas ! on the morrow, on calling,
he learnt, to his astonishment, that a quarter of
an hour after having taken the remedy, the poor
man died. —"" Dear, dear!"" murmured the doctor;
and again pulling out his pocket-book, he added

YOUNO MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION.- Lase evening
the fifth of a series of lectures in connection with thii
association was delivered in tho now Temperance Hall,
Pitt.street, by the Rev. Joseph Beazley, subject
"" Popular Amusements."" Thnro was a very numerous and
highly respectable attendance, tho Hall being well filled
The chair was taken by Captain Martindale, R.E., whe
in a few appropriate observations introduced the lec-
turer, who commence! by remarking that, hy tho com-
mittee having assigned to bim bis subjeot be bad bjen
relieved from the difficult task of oboosin-j one. Hiving
referred to the many difficulties connected with' HO
important a subjiot, he would endeavour to look at it,
not only as a minister : of the Gospel, but ns n
thinking Christian min and a philanthropist,
and a oitizen. Ile proceeded to show that popular
amusements wire indispensable to roan's bodily
health, whioh he proved by the testimony oj
medical mon. To bis mental health, referring to the
lives of Sir Walter . Scott, Dr. Johnson, and others, as
attesting the-truth of his theory, arid also to religion
, showing, that in order to bo onnblcd to SOIVJ his God
deligeiitly and well lie must have relaxation, adducing as
an example the lifo of Martin Luther. He next wont
into tho question of the law which should guide the
Christian in bis oboice of emus mont?, pointing out the
ahsenao of any rule upon tho subject in the Bible, but
showing that certain great principles wero
therein laid down for our guidanoe in tb»
matter,;-iBt That WA should not attend any place
where tho spirituality of the soul was likely to bo im-
paired; Sadly, in this, as in all other matters, the
Christian should follow tho oxnmplo of Christ, and ask
himself the quostion what would bo the Saviour's onimo
undur similar circumstances; nnd lastly, should atten I
no plaoe whare ho had a doubt of its advisability. Ho
then applied these principles to same of the popular
amusements whioh existed nt tho present day, approv-
ing strnnuly of onnoeriN similar to those, bold at the
University Festival, and dwelling in oloquont language
on the offeot of the oratorio of tho Messiah on his own
mind; and, in strong and most powerful languago, ex-
pressing lils disapproval of tho theatro- giving, amongst
numerous reasons and examples, tho enso of Mnoready
endeavouring to reform tho London stnga, and his^otnl
failure. Tho lecturer ot tho oonolunion was loudly ap-
plauded. A volo"" of thanks to thu Rov. BOirlnniHti was
moved by tho ,Rev. J. Reid, who, although mainly agree-
ing with tho principles onnnuiatod, tUffered, with him
with roforoncB to tho oratorio«. Tho motion was
soaondcd'by James Farnell, Esq:, M.P., and carried by
acclamation. A vote of thanks haying boen accorded to
Captain Martindale fer presiding, tho. mooting closed
with tho Doxology.

A writer, whose delineations of scenes
in life possess extreme beauty .and a
lively reality, has called an auction, a
'stfe.yre-of mingled laughter and heart
""btfiali* ""I <&n speak to the truth of this,
for ,1*""have just beçnjat one; to me
.however, it was rather of.the description
of the latter. The bankruptcy of LI. F. was
to be visited upon himself and his family
by the disposal of his property. I went
to »the sale rather early in order to have
a,full inspection, of the articles I designed
to bid for. Some of the auditory chieflv
'of the soft pex had assembled themselves'
aVthe end of the room and on the right
of the rostrum. They were chiefly en-
gaged as 1 entered in an exchange of ill
natured remarks on the family whose
^isfortunes had congregated them to-
gether. ,A tall, meagre looking old»
maid was the most prominent figure in
the group, both in point of size and
speech. She looked like one of that sort!
of beings who invite you a distance of1
five miles to tea, and then put on the
table a round and a half of dry toast,
and a plate with no more butter than one'
needs to swear by, and at last dismisses
you, with a glass of sweet wine, sans¡
'souper. A tone of bitter malice andj
'sjcprn distinguished all that she said. Byj
her jside stood a vulgar, little fat woman, j
iwith a couple of daughters whose high'
'cheek bones threatened to blind their
eyes, and bed post ancles promised'
""badly for ready made boots. Contrasting'
ia splendid piece of ,furniture with the!
fallen fortunes of Mrs. F. the former,1
triumphantly exclaimed that Mrs. F.V
"" high airs and flouncing humours had'
brought her lower down than a grocers i
Wadi; now."" Among others who had
,assembled ; I noticed a bustling person-
age, tlie cut of whose phiz, told me that
iheicould put low and high prices on the
.same article; there was a vast deal of
""professional consequence in his deport-,
.jiiúpt and he looked as if he would wil
.^îngly excuse the absence of nearly every¡
lone but himself. As he inspected each
article he was careful in enlightening his
neighbours on the flaws he discovered!
which he did wrih a knowing hypocritical
shake of the head, as much as to say,
* ratler you than I, buy that.' From a
'side door into the room, we were in, a
young, married woman, with two cherub
'children entered shortly after the sale
liad commenced, her dress seemed to
tB.aye been carelessly put on, her spirits
dejected, altogether, she was the picture
of misery. »The auctioneer was just at
Hbis moment exciting the laughter of Hhe
refined, by descanting op. the excellent
r qualities of some damaged culinary
utensils, and others unmentionable.
The rude laughter around, contrasted
painfully with the melancholy countenance
of the poor woman I have mentioned.
She was once mistress of the house we
were in. The next lot put up by the
man of the hammer, was a smalls mina
ture portrait The poor woman bid for
it, but was stoutly and to appearance,-?
warmly opposed by the old maid; to
whom it was at last knocked down. This
unfeeling wretch, I afterwards found out
to be one of those hopeless husband
^seekers, who disgust you by their assump
itdon of the airs of eighteen, after they
have arrived at withered thirty five, and
trwho received another damper to the many
,ghe had before experienced, in the mar-
riage of Mrs. F-to the man whom her
»folly 'had destined for its victim. I was
* subsequently enlightened as to who the
bu^t]ing ,personage who engaged himself
BP anxiously in detecting flaws in the fur
'niture was.-A broker I The fat lady
with the ox looking daughters, was the
vulgar wife of a pimple faced grocer,
over whom she exerted a queenly sway.
Denied the intimacy of Mrs. F.-who was
an accomplished woman, and a lady, she
caine hither to indulge the triumph of her
'header purse. I remained until the
auction was clpsed, witnessing the viru-
lence of human being against human
being,-the pride of creatures elevated
to stations in which ¿heir vulgarity became
more disgusting,-the meaness of petty
advantage seekers,-the cupidity and
heart-hardedness of the world. As I
burned away I involuntarily gaye utterance
¿oHhese feelings, but it was no matter.

pressed.

MAUKSBS fir oua ANCESTORS.-Lord Dor-
chester having no wife to do the honors of his
table at Thoresby, imposed that task upon his
» eldestdauguter, as soon as she had bodily strength
for the office, which in those days required no
small share, for the mistress of a country man-
sion was not only to invite-that is, urge and
tease-her company to eat more than human
throats could conveniently swallow, but to carve
every dish, when chosen, with her own hands.
The greater the lidy, the more indispensable
the duty,-each joint was carried up in its turn,
to be operated upon by her, and her alone;
since the peels and knights on either hand weie
so far from being bound to offer their assistance,
that the very master of the house, posted oppo-
site to her, might not act as her croupier ; his
department was to push the bottle after dinner.
As for the crowd of guests, the most inconsider-
able among them-the curate, or subaltern, or
squire's younger brother-if suffered through her
neglect to help himself to a slice of the mutton
placed before him, would have chewed it in bit-
terness, and gone home an affronted man, half
inclined to give a wrong vote at the next elec-
tion. There were dien professed carving mas
teis, who taught young ladies the art scientific-
ally; from one of whom Lady Mary said she
took lessons three times a-week, that she might
be perfect on her father's public days ; when in
order to perform, her functions without interrup-
tion, she was forced to eat her own dinner alone
an hour or two beforehand_Lord Jf harncliffe's
Correspondence of Lady W. Montague.
INFLUENCE OK AccincNTAL CIRCUMSTANCES
ON THE Arr-LicATioN OP'MIND.-The illustrious
French Naturalist, Adanson, was in very early
life distinguished by his proficiency in i classical
studies. In his first years at College, he ob-
tained the highest prizes in Greek and Latin
poetry, on which occasion he was presented with
the works of Pliny and Aristotle. Tlie interest
which such a circumstance could not fail to give
to the works of these ancient enquirers into ni»,
turc, led him to pay so much attention to the
subjects of which they treated, that when he was!
scarcely thirteen years of age, he wrote some1
valuable notes on the volumes that had been
given to reward his studies of a different kind.
Vancanson, the celebrated mechanician, who, in
every thing which did not relate to his art,
show ed so much stupidity, that it has been said
of him, that he was as much a machine as any
of the machines which he made-happened,
when a boy, to be long and frequently shut up
in a room in which there w as nothing but a
clock, which, therefore, as the only object of
amusement, he occupied himself with examin-
ing, so as at last to discover the connexion and
uses of its parts ; and the construction of ma-
chines was afterwards his constant delight and
occupation -Brown's Lectures on the Philosophy
of the Human Mind.
PROPHETIC POWER BEFORE DEATH.-Sir H.
Halford gives the following extraordinary in-
stance of this supposed prophetic power:-<* A
young gentleman, who had been using mercury,
caught cold while under its influence, and be-
came affected with fever. On the seventh day,
when Sir Henry was first called in, he was in a
state of the highest excitement, threatening those
around him, and not to be approached without
increasing his irritation to fury. He was put
under restraint, and tartarized antimony admi-
nistered at intervals, in doses of a grain each
time. On the eleventh day from the commence-
ment of the attack he became quite calm, and
to those about him he seemed much better. It
was observed that he had repeatedly said he
should die, and talked with the utmost compo-
sure of his affairs, giving directions for their ar-
rangement. Ile sent messages to his absent
friends, and spoke of a sister recently dead as
one whom he was about immediately to follow.
In answer to his interrogations, Sir Henry found
that he had not slept anterior to his quietude,
and that his pulse was quicker than ever. He
then became satisfied that the improvement was
but in appearance, that it was ' a lightning be-
fore death,' and that the hours of the patient
were numbered. He died that night.""
HOME.-Plome is the place where a man is
principally at his ease. It is the place where
he most breathes his native air : his lungs play
without impediment; and every respiration
brings a pure element, and a cheerful and gay
frame of mind. Home is the place where he
most easily accomplishes all his designs : he has
his furniture and materials, and the elements
of his occupations entirely within his reach.
Home is the place where he can be uninter-
rupted. He is in a castle which is his in full
propriety. No unwelcome guests can intrude ;
no harsh »mnds can disturb his contemplations ;
he is the master, and can command a silence
equal to that of the tomb, whenever he pleases.
William Godwin.
EnucATioN.-No person of a sober and en-
larged mind can for a moment delude himself
into the opinion, that when he is delivered into
his own bands, his education is ended. In a sense
to which no one is a stranger, the education of
man andhis life terminate together. We should at
no period of our existence, be backward to re-
ceive information, and should at all times pre-

THE SPELLING LESSON.
Jackie didn't like his lessons
Hated spelling worst of all;
Such a fuss about a letter,
If he wrote, ""I play at bal,""
Who would care, except a teacher,
For a tiny fault like that?
Down went pen, and off flew Jackie
' For the postman knocked rat-tat.
Ha! a letter, too, for Jackie,
Come from Brighton. Uncle Joe,
What he needed for his birthday,. :
Straight by post would like to know.
No more grumbling now from Jackie,
Paper, pen, he called for quick.
""Dearest Uncle,"" wrote while smiling,
""I do think you are a brick.""
""Rabbits I am very fond of
The new sort that's rather rare,
Mother sends her love and Susie,
Could you let me have a pair?
""Now good-bye, your loving Jackie.""
Off the letter went at once.
But next week, upon the birthday,
Puzzled was the little dunce.
By a small brown paper parcel,
Coming from his ""Uncle Joe,
With some common pears inside it
Three a penny ones, you know.
""Stupid Uncle Joe!"" he shouted,
' Stamped his foot, and tore his hair,
Till his teacher softly whispered, .
""Jackie, how did you spell pair?""
Very red turned Master Jackie,
Nothing more had he to say;
Uncle Joe had taught a lesson,
And-the rabbits came next day.

But greet him the same as your mate.

THE LAST SILENCE.
Silence across the waters of the bay,
Silence where floats a cloud upon the blue,
Some day the tired soul will slip away,
And only silence will be left to you.
Then will you sorrow? You, who cannot care.
Folding my weary hands upon my breast
Closing the eyes that are no longer fair --
Leaving the worn-out spirit to its rest.
If, but a little while, your eyes are wet,
If, but a little, for a life ill-spent;
Noting the silence-ere you quite forget;
If but a little. I shall be content.

Or else I would have courted thee:--
One who can write with so much taste,
And sing so sweet, and sing so chaste,

You are both sensible and witty!

A single look of anger try,
Towards one who smiles with so much grace,
And has too such an Angel's face!

Yet why have you so anxious strove
To make me be both ""Hand and Glove""?
It needs no argument to prove
In this you must be wrong my love!

And would I really sneak away,
And not a single Farewell say?
Oh! no--you have not lost me yet,
You'll find me in the next Gazette!

NOT A GLOVE.
Tht're is an important notice from the
Collector of Internal Revenue in another column
respecting the quit-rents due from Sydney, to wh'ch
wepailicularly direct the attention of parties holding
property in the town.
A free man, named Kearney, hired
servant to Mr. G L. Poignand, the Solicitor, wai»
brought before the Police Bench, yesterday, charged
with making away w th several articles of silver
plate entrusted to his charge. The pris'oner, who
stated himself to be a Frenchman, had been only
fourteen days in his present employment and f om
the circumstance of his being absent from his service
during the whole oí Wednesday, and returning home
at night in a beastly state of intoxication, Mr.
Poignantl' deemed it prudent to relieve him,of tho
charge with which he was entrusted, but on mus-
tering the articles which had been delivered to bim,
one silver dessert spoon, two silver salt spoons, and
some otjier trifling articles were discovered to be
absent. Upon being questioned as to what had be-
come of his master's property, the prisoner was ex-
cessively insolent and abusive, anil denied having
received the aiticles which were missing, upon which
Mr. Poignand gave him into custody. When brought
befoie the-bench, the prisoner stated that he left
the whole of his master's spoons in. the kitchen when
ho went out in tffe morning, andas there did not
appear to beany evidence contradictory of this state-
ment, and as Mr. P. stated that other persons had
aeccss to the kitchen, the Magistrate did not think
there was a sufficient case made out to:be sent before
a jury, and the prisoner was consequently discharged,
l'ne bench, however, advised the prisoner, as ho
valued his repu ation to make diligent seaich after
the lost articles, in order that they might be restored
to his master, or the Police would have a sharp look,
out after him.",The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser ,"577,349,483,372,621,716,685,743,347,716,619,664,520,113,568,423,721,545,59,562,679,481,577,41,518,499,565,555,456,310,808,854,853,853,335,798,854,854,859,859,859,862,861,855,857,852,854,856,856,855,851,851,853,849,851,854,853,854,857,853,854,851,854,851,854,855,854,221",Sat 4 Oct 1834,"363,470,518,571,675,715,754,791,845,878,915,953,992,1050,1081,1119,1158,1196,1254,1285,1324,1362,1400,1457,1487,1522,1565,1603,1647,1696,1820,1866,1906,1948,1985,2021,2074,2106,2145,2184,2224,2258,2298,2336,2378,2413,2451,2491,2531,2571,2608,2648,2684,2723,2759,2797,2838,2874,2917,2957,2995,3029,3068,3107,3145,3184,3222,3260","4951,5034,4994,5018,4891,4892,4894,4893,5220,4896,4896,4898,4898,5217,4897,4897,4899,4897,5220,4902,4901,4902,4903,5233,4904,4904,4907,4906,4869,5375,4878,4830,4829,4830,4830,4880,4830,4830,4829,4829,4832,4829,4829,4831,4832,4833,4833,4832,4834,4833,4833,4834,4834,4837,4835,4835,4835,4836,4834,4835,4834,4835,4834,4840,4835,4832,4833,4830",2217235,Page 2

usual weekly meeting last evening, when the
subject discussed related to the recent peti
tion of ccrtnin Tasmanian colonists against

was-whether tho existence of such a peti-
tion was to bo regalded as indicativo of the
failure of responsible government iu that
colony ; and, after a warm debate, it was
decided in the negative by a largo majority.
The subject chosen for noxt Thursday even-

You may sing of English homesteads,
With their fields of golden corn,
Or the hedge of pearly hawthorn
In the dewy summer morn !

And Australia young and free.
You may sing old Scotia's praises,
Blooming heath, or stern hill side
Granite, peat, or fertile valley,
Where Bruce fought, how Wallace died.
You may boast her men unconquered,
And her freedom none would sell,
But, of better nobler triumphs,
Yet our history shall tell.
You may sing of Tara's princes,
Brave and strong, in days of old,
And may say, in Erin's service
One true heart shall ne'er grow cold.
But I'll sing of fair Australia,
And her onward destiny,
Of her acres yet unconquered,
Of her homes secure and free.
Where, from ancient wrongs delivered—
Briton, Saxon, Gael, or Scot
May rejoice in quarrels vanished—
Battles ended, feuds forgot.

ON SEEING LORD BYRON'S WORKS BOUND IN
ASS'S SKIN.
SINCE Byron all poets in wildness surpasses,
His works have been bound (perhaps) in skins of wild asses,
No disgrace to the Bard---that they thought it no sin,
But the rudeness without suits the wildness within!
But as an apology for making so bold,
The binding is handsomely finished with gold.
His was the genius which conspicuous shone,
With splendid native brightness---all his own!
And 'twas his art each bosom to inspire,
With heaven-born rapture when he tuned his lyre,
His flights were daring, his ideas wild,
But all was beauty when th' enthusiast smiled---
As when some wild tornado rends the skies,
Through heaven's dark void the vengeful lightning flies,
And ten-fold thunders shake the solid land---
The scene, though dreadful, is sublimely grand!
But when again the sun's bright orb is seen,
And new-born radiance beams through heaven serene
Harmony reigns where discord raged before,
And fear, and terror, fright the soul no more!

' By ""IXION.""
America.
I
THINK America must be
A most peculiar land,
According to the picture shows,
You see on every hand.
A place where cowboys ge about
The streets of every town
With sawed off shotguns in their
belts
For shooting people down.
Where fellows loaf around the pubs,
In Texan hatted pate,
Remarking to each other: ""Well,
I guess an calkerlate!""
Or spend their days in galloping
Up mountain slopes and down,
And after them, in hot pursuit.
The sheriff of the town.
Where everybody seems to eat
A food they call ""hot dogs,""
And criminals a fortune make
By selling poisoned grogs.
And, O the morals of the place!
The utter disregard of law!
But here, perhaps, it may be well
The curtain for to draw.
They're Off.
PN route to the seaside with his wife,
?Lj the Western squatter stayed off a
day in Brisbane to see the races.
Scorching and sweltering ni the
grand stand, he mentioned to his wife
that he would like to remove his coat.
""Don't you do anything of the
kind,"" she answered. ""RememL-jr,
you're not out on the run now. You
can't do these things down here !""
He took off the coat, however, and
in a little while proposed also to re-
move his waistcoat.
""Do have some sense of decency,""
she said. ""I'm really ashamed of you.
What will you do next?""
But he took off the vest all the
same. In disgust she turned her back
on him. ""I don't want to let people
see I'm with you,"" she said testily.
Just then a woman who had been
watching the race start cried out,
""They're off. They're off.""
The wife fainted.
With Wilkins.
O YOU who tread the narrow way
^ From house to office day by day,
Do you not long to be away
With Wilkins down in Grahamland?
Who face the stewy summer heat
In stuffy office, sweaty street,
Would you not like to take a seat
With Wilkins over Grahamland?
Enmeshed in routine, hopelessly"",
To be the man you'd like to be;
To nam the world's wide spaces, free,
Like Wilkins down in Grahamland?
To take the risk and test your worth
In all the corners of the earth,
From nether pole to tropics girth.
With Wilkins down in Grahaimand?
But there he is and here you be,
A standardised epitome,
While Wilkins soars the Polar Sea
Away below in Grahamland.
And thus you stay and eat your rice.
And dream of him, and say: How nice
To oe with Wilkins o'er the ice
Down there below in Grahamland!
Looks Familiar.
XJE was an enthusiastic fisherman,
±x and had been spending the week-
end down the Bay. There was an
amateur photographer in the party,
and what should be more natural than
that he should have his picture taken,
rod hi hand, standing by the 601b. cod
that he had caught.
He showed it proudly to Jownes at
the Fisherman's Club. Jownes has the
reputation of having seen every fish
of any consequence that has come out
of the Bay.
""And what do you think of it?"" ask-
ed the proud captor.
""Well,"" said Jownes, ""It's a first
rate picture of you. But somehow that
cod looks familiar to me.""
The Next Generation.
V\7ITH 1000 persons killed' and 15,000
wounded in Australia by motor
cars last year, the natural process of
eliminating the unfit is making great
progress. The next generation will
probably have evolved the following
characteristics:
Faculty of instantaneously springing
a safe distance either forwards, back-
wards, or sideways.
Ability to vault from standing, either
over the bonnet of a moving car or
over the hood, or even the full length
of the car.
Capacity to discern a car anywhere
within 90deg. of a circle of sight.
Ability to turn a back or front somer-
sault or handspring instantaneously.
Pedestrians possessing these qualifi-
cations will be licensed to cross streets
unaccompanied by the police.
The Southport Road.
Scene I.
(""IN the Southport-road the sun was
v-' glaring down. It was the very
last day any motorist would select to
change a tyre. An awfully pretty girl
and a young man pulled in beside the
road. The youth got down to Investi-
gate the trouble. ""Hang it all,"" he
said, ""it's a blow out. I haven't
brought a Jack. Stop here till I go
and look for a sapling to lever the
wheel up!""
Scene 2.
Several cars driven by youths with
pretty girls pull up beside, and tact-
fully proffer assistance to the pathetic
young lady standing beside the car.
But realising how pretty she was, their
own girls became impatient and egg
them to go on.
Scene 3.
A couple of middle-aged married
men, out for the week-end, pull up,
and sternly insist on remedying the
trouble. Perspiring profusely they
work till they complete the job. The
young man concealed in the timber
sticks his head out from time to
time.
When the heroic middle-aged have
been thanked, and departed, the young
man comes out of his hiding place.
""By jingo,"" he said, ""those old birds
made a good job of it!""
Original Ideas.
""TjEPOStTOR : I received a letter
J-/ from my bank manager the other
day notifying me that his directors
would be glad if I would reduce my
credit balance before the end of the
year.
I pulled myself together, and re-
read the document. Yes, it said
""Credit Balance"" all right.
I reached for my hat, and went
down and saw the manager. ""What's
the meaning of this?"" I asked. ""I
thought vou people liked to have
credit balances.""
""The old directors did."" he said,
""but there's a fresh lot in now with
very original ideas. Seeing that de-
positors will insist on hoarding up
money in bad times, they hold that
the practice only accentuates and pro-
longs depressions. The new policy is
to encourage people to save money in
good times, when it is plentiful, and
to put it into circulation when times
are bad and good investments are
going .begging.""
""But the bank invests my credit
money?""
""Partly, but we, too, were wont to
tighten up and call up money in bad
times. In future all that sort of
thins will be done away with.""
""Well,"" I said, ""of all the muddle

the individual to some sunny hill, where he is inspired

Our home is the gibber-gunyah,
Where hill joins hill on high;
Where the turruma and berrambo,
Like sleeping serpents lie;--
And the rushing of wings, as the wangas pass,
Sweeps the wallaby's print from the glistening grass.
Ours are the makoro gliding,
Deep in the shady pool:
For our spear is sure, and the prey secure--
Kanin, or the bright gherool.
Our lubras sleep by the bato clear,
That the Amygest's track hath never been near.
Ours is the koolema flowing,
With precious kirrika stored:
For fleet the foot, and keen the eye,
That seeks the nukkung's hoard;--
And the glances are bright, and the footsteps are free,
When we dance in the shade ot the karakun tree.
Glbber-gunya--Cave in the rock.
Turruna and Berrambo--War arms.
Wanga--A species of pigeon.

Jolly brewer! Go home and brew--
Your ale may be good, but it's rather new;
Stow it away for another year--
It's dangerous drinking--is all new beer.
Go back to your cellar, and bung the vat--
When liquor runs over, it soon grows flat;
New beer and sour we'll never endure--
Go back or the thing'll be past all cure.

Go back to your house in Woolloomooloo,

THE WRONG SHIP FOR BIDDY.
PORTANTER.
P ADDY, mon frere, we should but poorly fare
Throughout all dull and sober Christendom
Sons thy sweet tongue and humor debonnaire,
That have been, are. and shall for ever come,
as sparaunr mirth unto us graver fools,
Who wend through grooves and tamelv bow to rales.
If thou of piquant nose and mellow brogue
•should stoop to servile fashions more In rone.
Thou wonldst bnt ape severer man, and mar
The choicest, queerest gift to earth, thru far.
Biddy, ma chert, if bungling Pat seems queer
Twixt bis potato-face and native wit—
With crowning bine-black hair. then art!-)fol{l) dear.
Eyes set in glorious contrast, cheeks to fit,
Art nature's triumph I And we joy to see
Pat's vein in thee is drollest witchery.
Thus Pat, and Biddy true maid, thus remain,
Destin'd from fair ancestral Spain to tread,
Milesian lords and ladies, aptly bred.
But to my theme. Oar good ship had been oat
A hundred days, when darkly through the baas
Of ocean loomed a vessel, and the shont
That erected her caused mate and men to raise
Onr signals high, whereat tbe shadow's prond
Responsive Bags revealed the "" Flying Cloud;""
Her speaking ribands told, to our dismay,
"" Out seventy days;"" "" London to Moreton Bay.""
We looked aghast, and groaning deep and load,
From our staunch ""tub"" uprose to yard and shroud,
Again waxed Luna, and again she waned
Ere our dull orbs winked wink with Horeton's star.
Scarce had the swarthy pilot welt explained
The "" Cloud's "" arrival hack a fortnight far.
Than thereupon sweet Biddy did aver
We should have sooner reached this Au.trilyer
Had we but stayed at home, nor thus have come:
Her dainty lips so spoke—our own were "" mum.""
(Tbe friends she bade adieu iu Cork that year
Adown the Brisbane came to welcome her.)
To become a lion of a party it it not necessary
to make a beast of one's self.
Why is a henpecked husband like an opera
hat F—Because he's very big when he's out, but
immediately shuts up when he gets home.
Rbabonabli.—"" Why do you choose a single
life P"" asked a fashionable idler of an estimable
young lady. ""Because,"" she replied, 'I am
not able te support a husband.""
Lboitucatb Business.—A doctor went out
for a day's hunting, and, on coming home, com*
plained tbat he hadn't killed anything. "" That's
because you didn't attend to your legitimate
business,"" said his wife.
Judicial Joki.—ln Judge M'Arthur's court,
recently, a lawyer called the judge's attention to
the fact that a certain case had been upon the
docket for a decade. "" I know it,"" said the
judge, "" but the case has not decayed.""
Hairs, not Bristles—"" I am willing to
split bairs with my opponent all day if he insist*
on it,"" said a oelebratnd Irish lawyer, in a
speech at the bar. "" Bpilt tbat, then,"" said tha
opponent, pulling a specimen from his own
head, and extending it. "" May it please your
lordship, I didn't say bristles,"" was the response.
Truth ik Jest.—A Scotoh postmaster,
puzzling out a very unocrtain superscription to
an Irish letter, jocosely remarked to an intelli
gent son of Erin who stood by that the Irish
brought a hard set of names to Scotland,
"" That's a fact, yer honor,"" replied the Irishman,
""but they get harder ones after they arrive
here.""
No Laughing Matter.—ln the Paris.
theatres professional laughers are employed, who
engage to indulge iu tbe most contagious hilarity,
the time of their merriment being previously
arranged. A few nights sinoe the programme
was changed without the knowledge of one of
the laughers, and when he burst forth up
roariously in the midst of a touching couplet
about Alsace and Lorraine, the audience nearly
killed him.
Touching Gratitude.—A little boy, the
child of a wealthy mother, tumbled into the
river. He was rescued by a working man and
restored to his brokenhearted parent. The
woman gave him a penny postage-stamp, and
said she would be glad to have him come up to
her house and sit out in the entry and hear her
play tbe piano. He went away with tears in hit
eyes. He said he wasn't used to suoh over
whelming kindness.
Artful.—An engaged young gentleman got
rather neatly out o( a little scrape with bia
intended. She taxed him with having kissed
two youn^ ladies at some party at which she
was not present. He owned it, but said that
their united ages only made twenty-one. The
simple-minded girl thought of ten and eleven,
and laughed off her pout. He did not explain
tbat one was nine een and the other two yean
of age. Wasn't it aitful? Just like the men I
Judging by Appkabancbs.—A printer whose
voice and hearing were considerably impaired,
bat who wished to create as little inconvenience
as possible by these defects, found it necessary
one day to put a question to a short sighted
fellow-workman in aa o ' ce whioh he had just
entered. This he did in writing, but was asked,
in tbe proverbial Scotch style of asking another
question instead of answering tbat put: ""Do
you think I am deaf booause I wear speos P""
A Caution to Housewives —The following,
of course, happened in Paris:—A servant
entered her mistress* apartments, crying and
sobbing, "" Madame! oh, madame 1"" "" What is
the matter, Franchise P"" "" Madame, I have
stuck a fork into my finger."" "" Oh, that's
nothing, Francoise; you will not feel it to
morrow."" "" I should not be afraid, Madams,
if I was sure the fork was silver."" "" You may,
then, be perfeotly easy ; tbe fork is—all our
forks are silver."" "" Oh! then I don't feel
alarmed ; but I was dreadfully frightened, for I
thought the fork was plated."" Francoise dis
appeared, taking all the forks with her.
A Goon Dinner and its Cost.—A couple of
flat-boat men on tbe Mississippi River, having
made an extraordinary good speculation, con
cluded that while they were in New Orleans
they would for once in their lives see what it
was to have a real first-class hotel dinner. Tbey
could afford it, and they would just like to see
how it would go. So they went to the St.
Charles Hotel and ordered the very best dinner
tbat establishment could afford. When tbey
had eaten to their complete and entire satisfac
tion (and the probable surprise of the waiters),
they called for their bill. Tbe waiter in attend
ance misunderstood tbem, and, supposing they
wanted the bill of fare, laid it before tbem,
with the wine list uppermost. "" Whew, Bill,""
said Jerry, "" hire's a bill! Just look at it!
Here, you add up one side, and I'll add up tbe
other, and we'll see what tho old thing comes
to."" So Bill added up tho prices of the wines

Caution.—One day at Blair Alhol, the Duke,
having entertained a largo party at dinner, pro
duced in the evening many curious and inte
resting family relies for their inspection, anongst
them a small watch which hud belonged to
Charles Stuart, und hud boon givcu by him to
one of the Duke's ancestor*. When the company
were on the point of departing, tho watch was
suddenly missed, und was searched for in vain
upon the table and about the apartments.
Tbe luke was exoeedirgly vexfd, and deolared
that of all the articles be Lad exhibited tbe lost
watob was the one he most valued. The guests
naturally became exceedingly uncomfortable,
and eyed each other suspiciously. No person
was present however who could possibly be sus
pected, and courtesy forbade any stronger step
than the marked expression of tiro noble host's
extreme annovur.ee »""•<' distress. Euoh de
parted to his homo iu an exceedingly unenviable
state of mind, aud tbe mysterious disappearance
of the royal relio was a suljeot of discussion
for several months in society. A year afterwards,
the Duke, being again at Blair Athol.was dressing
for dinner, and iu the braast pocket of a coat
which his valet bad handed to him felt some- *
thing, which proved to be tho missing watch.
""Why, ,"" exclaimed bis Grace, addressing
his man by name, "" here's tbe watch we hunted
everywhere in vain for!"" "" Yes, sir,"" replied
the man, gravely ; "" I saw your Grace put it in
your pocket."" "" You caw me put it injo mr
pocket, and never mentioned it! Why didn t
you speak at once, and prevent all that trouble
and unpleasant feeling."" "" I didna ken what
might hae been your Grace's intentions,"" was
tbe reply of the faithful and discreet Highlander,
who saw everything, but said nothing, unless
' directly interrogated.",The Queenslander ,"664,606,184,726,700,755,728,642,856,703,770,721,722,729,636,859,688,674,621,729,696,601,775,771,639,764,732,759,675,800,764,870,665,839,706,715,605,758,797,796,734,704,866,553,870,913,801,866,914,915,603,870,912,912,913,446,867,913,910,909,747,866,912,912,912,909,912,913,866,910,897,911,910,910,912,115,896,913,913,913,908,915,888,915,912,203,871,911,913,914,912,912,911,910,892,365,864,911,912,911,908,911,909,914,912,908,867,911,909,911,909,906,911,908,907,848,864,910,909,909,911,907,892,909,904,907,909,907,891,745,865,911,891,912,911,912,912,912,912,911,894,910,890,912,907,908,905,908,905,908,909,909,911,912,908,912,912,913,912,889,109,871,894,886,913,913,911,914,908,910,912,911,914,908,910,910,893,910,911,893,913,912,914,913,913,913,943,910,910,912,910,910,910,909,910,909,909,905,908,415",Sat 31 May 1873,"483,641,2083,699,732,769,803,847,869,904,934,969,1000,1058,1093,1128,1161,1195,1227,1261,1294,1328,1383,1419,1450,1485,1520,1553,1587,1620,1654,1688,1743,1778,1811,1844,1877,1910,1943,1980,2009,2044,2148,2195,2236,2280,2324,2370,2413,2457,2502,2546,2589,2633,2677,2721,2764,2809,2854,2896,2940,2983,3028,3071,3118,3162,3206,3249,3293,3339,3383,3427,3471,3515,3557,3600,3647,3690,3735,3780,3824,3868,3910,3954,3997,4043,4099,4142,4187,4233,4277,4321,4365,4409,4454,4499,4554,4598,4643,4685,4729,4775,4819,4863,4907,4950,5006,5052,5096,5139,5184,5228,5261,5317,5359,5402,5458,5502,5546,5591,5633,5677,5721,5767,5811,5854,5896,5940,5984,6030,6085,6129,6173,6217,6261,6306,6351,6394,6439,6483,6528,6570,6614,6658,6702,6746,6791,6833,6877,6920,6965,7009,7054,7098,7140,7184,7227,7271,7315,7359,7403,7458,7502,7546,7591,7636,7677,7723,7769,7811,7857,7901,7943,7987,8031,8074,8118,8162,8208,8250,8294,8339,8384,8428,8472,8515,8559,8603,8647,8691,8735,8781,8825,8868,8913,8957,8998,9043,9090,9126","6120,6153,6679,5986,6020,5986,6020,5986,5987,5987,5986,5986,5986,5986,6019,5986,6019,5986,5986,5986,5986,5986,5986,6016,5986,6016,5986,5986,5986,5986,5986,5986,5986,6016,5986,6016,5986,5986,5986,5986,5986,5986,6030,5986,6030,5987,5987,6035,5987,5986,5987,6031,5989,5989,5989,5989,6033,5989,5991,5991,5987,6036,5991,5992,5992,5991,5992,5991,6035,5992,5991,5991,5994,5991,5991,5989,6035,5991,5991,5992,5994,5994,5992,5992,5992,5994,6038,5997,5994,5995,5997,5995,5997,5997,5995,5997,6043,5998,5997,5998,5998,5998,5998,5997,5998,6000,6043,5998,6000,5997,5998,5998,5998,6000,6000,5998,6043,5998,5997,5998,5998,6000,6000,5998,5998,6000,6000,5998,6000,6000,6046,6000,6000,6000,6000,6000,6000,6000,6000,6002,6002,6002,6000,5998,6002,6002,6002,6002,6002,6000,5998,5998,5997,5995,5997,5995,5995,5995,5994,5995,5994,6038,5994,5994,5994,5994,5994,5992,5994,5994,5994,5994,5995,6000,5997,5997,5997,5997,5997,5995,5994,5995,5994,5994,5994,5994,5994,5994,5994,5994,5994,5994,5994,5995,5994,5995,5997,5997,5998,5980",27276142,Page 7

(FOR MARY GILMORE.)
In the far days, when every day was long,
Fear was upon me and the fear was strong,
Ere I had learned the recompense of song.
In the dim days I trembled, for I knew
God was above me, always frowning through,
And God was terrible and thunder-blue.
Creeds the discoloured awed my opening mind,
Perils, perplexities-what could I find?-
All the old terror waiting on mankind.
Even the gentle flowers of white and cream,
The rainbow with its treasury of dream,
Trembled because of God's ungracious scheme.
And in the night the many stars would say
Dark things unaltered in the light of day;
Fear was upon me ever in my play.
There was a lake I loved in gentle rain;
One day there fell a bird, a courtly crane;
Wisely he walked, as one who knows of pain.
Gracious he was and lofty as a king;
Silent he was, and yet he seemed to sing
Always of little children and the Spring.
God? Did he know him? lt was far he flew-
God was not terrible and thunder-blue;
-It was a gentle water-bird I keow.
Pity was in him for the weak and strong,
All who have suffered when the days were long,
And he was deep and gentle as a song.
As a calm soldier in a cloak of grey
He did commune with me for many a day
Till the dark fear was lifted far away.
Sober-apparelled, yet he caught the glow;
Always of heaven would he speak, and low,
And he did tell me where the wishes go.
Kinsfolk of his it was who long before
Came from the mist (and no one knows the
shore)
Came with the little children to the door.
Was he less wise than those birds long ago
Who flew from God (He surely willed it so)
Bearing great happiness to all below?
Long have I learned that all his speech was
true:
I cannot reason it-how far he flew
God ls not terrible nor thunder-blue.
Sometimes, when watching in the white sun-
shine,
Someone approaches-I can half define
All the calm beauty of that friend of mine.
Nothing of hatred will about him cling,
Silent-how silent-but his heart will sing
Always of little children and the Spring.

ROYAL VICTORIA THEATRE.--On Monday
night last, Mr. Nesbitt performed in five dif-
ferent characters, namely, Richard the III.,
Rolla, Shylock, Othello, and Sir Giles Over-
reach. This was certainly a most arduous
undertaking--though only one act in each piece
was performed; but he proved to the public that
his physical energies were equal to his mental
endowments. We expected nothing less, but
we must say that he exceeded our most sanguine
anticipations. He was indifferently supported,
for with the exception of Simmons, Spencer,
and Mrs. Thomson, the other actors seemed to
have as much conception of their parts as we
have of the theological principles of the Great
Mogul. However, to speak candidly, we must
say that we do not admire the garbling and
cutting up of such splendid pieces, for no sooner
has the audience got interested in the act per-
formed, than it is ended, and they have to
bother their brains--always provided that they
have any--to get interested in what follows;
still such an attempt once or twice during the
season is not ill timed, and gives the actor an
opportunity of shewing the variety of his abili-
ties to the verdict of public opinion.
On Tuesday evening the Theatre was pa-
tronized by Colonel French and the officers of
the 28th Regt., which leaves in a day or two
for India, where, we are afraid, they will have
less amusement than they had that night. The
applause given by the audience even on the
entrance of the band shewed the good feeling--
we may say the commiseration--of their coun-
trymen to the proper defenders of their native
land; and we have no doubt but that they will
defend it nobly. The band did indeed ""dis-
course most excellent music,"" and we sincerely
hope that its effect in the battle field will be as
great as it was in the Victoria on the evening
alluded to.
The play chosen for this occasion was the
MOUNTAINEERS, which Mr. Nesbitt performed to
great advantage. We would give a full report
of this piece, but our space will not allow us.
The duets ""Faint and wearily the way-worn
traveller,"" ""Oh happy Tawney Moor,"" and
""When the hollow drum,"" were very well sung
on the part of Mr. Simmons; but our opinion of
Mrs. Knowles continues unchanged,and we are
afraid ever will. The other entertainments went
off well. The Colonial farce of ""THE MOCK
CATALANI"" was repeated with great eclat. Pre-
vious to this, the following farewell address was
delivered by Mr. Simmons; it was, however,
much more creditable to the speaker than the
author:--
FAREWELL ADDRESS
TO THE
TWENTY-EIGHTH REGIMENT,
ON THEIR DEPARTURE TO INDIA,
SPOKEN AT THE
ROYAL VICTORIA THEATRE, SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES.
ON THE EVENING OF THE 14TH JUNE, 1842.
To-night Mock Catalani reappears
To greet his friends--an office that endears;
For humbie though has been the Author's task,
'Tis welcom'd: and what more can author ask?
A kindly welcome, from indulgent friends,
Is rich reward to all intents and ends.
Thus far ""Mock Catalani"" makes his bow;
Another object has its author now:
To bid Farewell! unto a martial band,
About to leave us for India's distant land;
To add fresh laurels to their old renown,
And guard the honour of the British Crown:
Make the fierce, false Affghans, in far Cabul,
Grow meek to Paddy, Sawney, and Jobn Bull.
They, with their steel array will heal the sore
Inflicted, but two deep, by Forty-Four.
Bold Sale, who keeps in awe the murd'rous hashers, -
Will hail, with warrior's warmth, the gallant ""Slashers,""
Their Chief will prove again their valour true,
Rememb'ring ""Albuhera!""--""Waterloo!!""
The gallant ""Slashers"" quit Australia's shore,
And we may ne'er behold their phalanx more;
Yet in our mem'ry will they linger long,
A beau ideal of the martial throng;
And many a gentle bosom, void of guile,
Will feel a pang--sweet lips will sadden'd smile.
Brave ""Twenty-Eight,"" who danger ne'er did shun,
Farewell! success we wish you every one.
The benefits come on shortly, but, as yet,
we are not able to tell the particular pieces that
will be performed. Mr. Nesbitt has chosen
the character of Macbeth, for his benefit, and
by what we have heard of the preparations about
to be made, it will be brought out in the most
splendid style. As to the acting of Mr. Nes-
bitt, it requires no comment.
THEATRE FRANÇAIS.--This Theatre was
tolerably filled yesterday evening. The acting
was really good, and might have passed off with
eclat in one of our largest metropolitan theatres.
We are really sorry that this was their last
appearance. The times or taste is bad in Syd-

to fall to the ground.",The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser ,"285,897,850,848,848,851,849,848,850,851,847,850,847,850,849,848,865,890,893,848,847,849,848,848,851,849,648,809,860,851,851,852,855,808,834,895,855,853,856,855,855,193,806,852,854,852,852,850,855,859,853,870,898,834,889,895,849,140,408,134,562,644,214,717,756,508,648,699,709,629,567,639,541,564,646,597,658,668,698,674,573,793,853,684,663,697,680,602,504,596,723,773,644,808,853,895,891,852,853,876,554,14,810,854,854,854,850,854,852,383",Thu 16 Jun 1842,"718,774,828,869,912,957,1000,1046,1082,1129,1174,1212,1254,1298,1339,1382,1424,1466,1508,1552,1595,1638,1681,1725,1769,1814,1853,1895,1939,1979,2021,2065,2108,2156,2200,2232,2277,2321,2374,2406,2454,2493,2537,2578,2625,2664,2707,2752,2793,2839,2879,2921,2952,3007,3044,3087,3137,3178,3241,3302,3332,3378,3438,3471,3562,3609,3643,3678,3711,3747,3781,3817,3850,3885,3907,3952,3988,4023,4056,4092,4126,4160,4196,4229,4263,4299,4333,4367,4403,4439,4472,4507,4540,4588,4637,4665,4703,4760,4803,4832,4882,4961,4972,5017,5063,5104,5146,5194,5233,5275","4969,4647,4692,4693,4693,4692,4692,4693,4691,4689,4692,4690,4692,4690,4690,4692,4677,4647,4647,4690,4691,4690,4691,4691,4689,4689,4690,4732,4689,4690,4691,4690,4688,4690,4691,4647,4690,4689,4688,4689,4689,4689,4738,4693,4691,4691,4691,4692,4690,4691,4692,4675,4647,4693,4654,4647,4693,4689,4911,5068,4838,4796,5012,4760,4736,4688,4687,4689,4689,4690,4689,4695,4676,4696,4672,4691,4690,4691,4689,4696,4690,4690,4693,4687,4690,4692,4692,4690,4688,4693,4691,4690,4689,4733,4691,4647,4650,4691,4691,4651,4647,4650,4735,4691,4691,4690,4695,4690,4693,4692",2556768,Page 2

Morven. F. BENNETT.
In spotless white my love was clad
When first I saw her face:
On Wollondilly hill we met—
A wattle marks the place.
An iunooent and loving girl,
Her soul was whiter yet '
And purer than the robe she wore—
My own, my dear Jeannette t -
In spotless white—a dream of grace-*
My bride she stood arrayed:
Igen'ly raised her blushing face
And kissed my own dear maid. ""
Half shy, yet wholly happy too,
She leaned upon my breast,
And, smiling through the starting tears,
Her trust and love confessed.
They decked her onoe again in white',
Her (ace was whiter still.
(The wattle shades her last, long sleep
On WollondiUy hill.)
The blinds were down—the voices trained;
Friends talked apart and low—
The mourners left me one by one—
I scaroely saw them go.
And once again in spotlesß white
My darling Bhall be dressed;
An angel there as hare on earth,
To endless ages blest.
Beneath the wattle oft I live
Our days of wooing o'er;
And wait on WollondiUy bill
To Join my love once more.",The Queenslander ,"412,831,573,435,479,425,468,700,599,633,632,469,542,655,519,458,658,485,630,417,635,337,713,518,589,386,543,477,539,359,475,408,477,458",Sat 15 Jan 1898,"1471,2709,1565,1600,1633,1666,1706,1732,1764,1797,1852,1885,1918,1953,1983,2019,2052,2085,2139,2173,2206,2239,2269,2306,2339,2373,2425,2460,2493,2526,2559,2594,2625,2660","728,526,630,663,630,658,625,660,625,660,625,657,622,660,625,660,625,660,627,660,628,660,627,658,627,660,625,660,625,660,627,660,627,660",21444728,Page 113

opoationed .oj the large number of prieonera in Darling,

fromthtt eitabliabment yesterday to Bathurst.
' THE OnrnEomaT Sooisir.-Thia aooiety gave their
third eonoeit last night, at the Maaonio Hall, in presence
of a full and' fashionable audience, wih m neb sureass.
The committee appealed determined, by the variety and.
exeellenee of the programme, to make up for the short,
comings of their last performance. The eonoert war.
divided into three parta; ic the first of which were intro.'
dueed 'three choruses from Wallaob'a new opera of
"" Love's- Triumph."" The flrat of lhasa "" Hither hasten1
all,"" fell somewhat flatly, owing to. its want of melody*
The alto pottion too was apparently very weak.. The
aoena ?'Vi'ni t la mia Vendetta,"" from ""Laorezla Borgia""
was given with floe effect by the amateur baas, Ur. John
Boebelle, who tbrew considerable energy in ila delivery,'
and at ita eonelneion was loudly applauded.; The pretlyr
oborua"" Mount and away"" wai very nicely sung and.
elioited warm approbation; Mr. Hodge next pla}ed a
eeleotion for tbe clarioned ta la bis steadily improving and'
mtsterly style, the variations"" being particularly good,'
The next Ohorns, "" Long life tri, har High o eta"" wee also
a credit to the chorus for their steady précision
and ocrreot intonation! . A young - lady pupil
of .Madame 'Wallace . Bu.btlle, with Mr. J.'
Bmbelle sang ""Of fairy wand"" in a romner
that refleots muoh praise on her talented Instructress,'
althongb, perhaps, a IOBS trying duet, would, have dig»
played her much improved aud inoreased skill to greater
advantage. Mr. ,Bashelle sang bia portion of tho duet
with 'great oorreotness and ability. ' Madamo Basbelle'
herself sang a Beena ol Vardi'd "" aioil:ar|VeBprr."" in bea
beat atjle, proving herself a eonsummate miatresin the
baautllul art she adorns. Next o.ne a song by that
always welcome amateur, Mr; J. Waller, aomposed
expressly for bim by Mr. Douglas Callen. It is ad^
mirably fitted to hie declamatory, and we may say,
heartfelt etile of , sloging, - and elioited an
undeniable enoore. AB a melody it is vary taking, and
wil1, doubtless, beoome a favour te with all baBB ama-
teure. It baa also a Ohorns, somewhat reminding ns of
G jd bless the Priooa of Wilee,"" by B. Biobards, wbiobj
W88 capitally sung by the ohorus. Toe oompositiou ot
thia song ia arneb io the credit of Mr. Caliea, in that
difficult portion of his profession. This part oonoluded
with Btebop'a Cough and Crow,'' the BOIOB b.in¡ well
suatained by membera of the eooiety-only a baas voies
would have been muoh mora eflVotlve in tba baee solo.
Tbe glee itself waa exeellently Bung, and reeelvsd great
applause: Virginia Gabriel's, anything but original
cantata, ""Dreamland,"" formed the eeoond part ot the
eonoert. Tb s oomposition may be termed a oolite ion
of other composers ehoioe ideas, well strung together,
and farming a very pleasing compilation. Tba opening
Ohorns, "" Camel Bells,"" ii very short and pretty, and
leads to a sweet air for a baritone, "" Dreama of Ibose
wbo love me,"" which was BO well sung ai to be almost
encored. The luooiedlog oberne, ""BSIBS tba.spell,"" ia
alao pretty end catoblng, but entirely without origin» -

AUSTRALIAN MELODIES.
No. I.
'Tis sweet to hear the bell bird's pipe,
Like sheep-bells faintly tinkling —
To see the cloud, o'er corn fields ripe,
Its rain-drops gently sprinkling;
And rainbow's arch, of varied hue,
Extending o'er the tropic blue.
'Tis sweet to sit in shady bower,
'Midst shrubs with heav'n's dew weeping —
See Sol his rays, at evening hour,
In misty splendour steeping;
When but the lonely curlew's tale
Disturbs the silence of the vale.
But sweeter far the native maid,
Of youthful suitor dreaming —
And sweeter far the auburn shade
Whence her blue eyes are beaming;
And sweet will be N-nd-or-e's bell
When 't doth the nuptial morning tell.

--o--
The plains are silver!
The sky is white, and the fruit-blossoms are
white,
Shaking and shining in sun, an eddying haze.
The air hangs round them like unseen bees.
It rises from them laden and faint,
Beating its wings towards the mountains,
Settling on lips and nostrils.
The plains are gold!
The orange-trees waver in autumn haze.
The fruitage bursts through the green line
gold,
Or in the milder light dims and swells
Like great topazes moon-enchanted.
In the wind they are flames;
The stillness veils them in quivering smoke;
In the dusk they are vaporous echoes.
The plains are blue!
Beneath dawn, amethystine,
A runnel of lucerne-flowers;
Or, in the night-stillness of winter,
A mirror of heaven-calm,
Making flat earth an infinity
Where love creates rarer than heavenly stars.

IN PROSE AND RHYME
TO Think and Remember.
(By WILL H. LITER)
Whenever you sec a soldier
Minns an eye, or a limb,
With armless sleeve, or on crutches,
Have a good thought for him.
There are many others disabled, .
Wheeled m sa Invalid chair,
And asms who lit helpless in cots,
And know not the out-door air.
Have a thought, my little children.
For these have suffered pain
That you should live in freedom
And ail its benefits gain.
Theirs was the spirit of Empire,
lb safeguard precious rights.
And twenty years ago to-day
They stormed OaUipoli heights.
And on other battlefields,
Life-blood was freely shed.
So as we think of the living,
Let us also remember the dead.
Don Bradman, our cricket hero,
learnt the rudiments of the gams
when he was a small boy. He made
his first century playing for his school
when he was 11 His 115 wag grati
fying, but any likelihood of conceit
was nipped hi the bud on the follow
ing morning when the headmaster
""slanged"" the boys for leaving one of
the school bats on the grounds of
their opponents, and did not allude to
Bradman's score. After Bradman left
school he assisted his local team, Bow
rai, and in a game against Moss Vale
he scored 800. In tbe next match he
scored 390 not out!
The boys and girls of Switzerland
take a great interest in the migration
of swallows. As the passage over
the Alps is most difficult, the chil
dren are always on the look-out for
distressed birds. They pick them up,
place them in baskets, carry them to
the railway station, and the guard
of the next train that arrives takes
charge ol them. When the warmer
country is reached the basket lids
are opened, the little birds fly away,
and. the baskets are sen*, back for
another batch.
In England, at wells, in Somerset,
there are swans in the moat sur
rounding the Bishops palace, who
ring the bell when they want food.
Nearly a hundred years ago a
daughter of one of the bishops taught
the swans to do fhlg. She had the
•efl fitted up with a rope, and the
birds were interested in the danghng
rope, with which they played. When
ever it was pulled hard enough the
neU rang and some pieeag of bread
were st ones thrown awi, so when
they were hungry they found that a?
they nad to do wss to give ths rope
r tug. The trick has been copied iy
each generation since the first learnt
■it.
The waterhen is very eomsaon * in
war lagoons, and Us plumage ? **uth
admired. It is not shy as regards
human associatioii, but it is always
alert, watchful, and cautious. Its nest
is usually in amongst grass or reeds
on the water-side, and at lane, with
a depression in the centre. The hen
bird lays from seven to nine eggs
m each clutch. The young chides
are beautiful little things, covered
with almost black down; they leave
the nest as soon as hatched; and can
swim very adroitly. f

WIND in the blue gums whispering
low,
Twitter of birds that come and go;
Scent of blossoms and hum of bees,
Cool deep shadows 'neath tall bush
trees!
Eerie wail of a lone curlew,
Grasses wet with the silver dew,
Buttercups onening in the dell
Toll of a chapel's matin bell.
Distant hilltops kissed by the sun,
Stony brooklet where waters run;
The bell-clear notes of the butcher
birds,
And the distant lowing of dairy herds!
Gold of the bottle-brush in bloom,
Painted wrens in lantanas gloom;
Sombre green of the pines aloof,
Rising above a gabled roof!
Pigeons strutting in purple and blue,
Shy brown doves from the branches
coo;
A veil of mist on Taylor's Range,
Call of a storm-bird, harsh and
strange !
A purple butterfly floating by,
Clouds of white in an azure sky;
A curl of smoke from a cottage fire,
And the shrill of cicadas rising higher I

Reformers may boast that their ballot
Makes working men sober and free,
But with taps flowing freely how shall it
With purest impression agree?
A fig for the flimsy delusion,
The rum men their rights will resign,
And nobblers abound in profusion,
And money to pay for them's mine.
""The Act"" may provide against treating,
(The Act that made me an M. P.,)
But nothing it says of unseating,--
It's penalties don't affect me.
My purse, it is true, is much lighter,
But well the investment will pay;
The outlay that draws its strings tighter,
I'll turn to advantage some way.
I bought the boors all in a cluster,
And carted them down to the poll,
With brandyballs, babble, and bluster.
Their wills I could sweetly control.
They voted like lambs, in my favour,
In a style that my foes must astound,
And I then, for their handsome behaviour,
Stood sam for the sinners all round.
But I swear by the powers of parchment,
My foes shall all find their mistake,
They'll know what the middle of March meant,
When in Court ""I the other side take.""
In future I'll patronise few shops--
Those only who followed my tether,
And I'll shut up our shabby old shoe shops,
By sending to Sydney for leather!

From the Tropics to the Poles ;

DNLY a paper windmill, only a baby's sock,
Duly a piece of winsey from the, hem of a little frock ;
But' a gray haired woman holds them in her work-worn
wrinkled baud.
Holds them as treasures dearer than gems from a foreign
strand.
Not a fair gentlewoman, such as painters love to trace -
No polished trick of manner, no studied ease or grace ;
A plaiu hard featured womau, who has led a life of toil,
But sorrow's seed aye beareth kindred fruit in kindred soil.
And on plaiu and homely features, as on brows of queenly
grace,
Pain nud grief, with heavy footsteps, leave unalterable trace.
And a mother's heart's as tender, and her love as pure and
true,
Tho' it beats beneath a cotton gown, or silks of brilliant hue.
"" Whv do I care for these things ?""-Well, I'll tell you if you
like
To listen. 'Tis nigh thirty years uow, since I married Mike,
And went to live on Buckinbah, that place beyond the hill ;
The little hut we lived in first stands near the slip-rail still.
. I felt it dull and lonesome, for I had'nt long been here,
And I'd left some merry sisters far away iu Devonshire;
This township wasu't laid out then, that road was just a
track,
It used to take us near three weeks to get to town and back.
But love, they say, eau brighten e'en the poorest lot iu life.
And I didn't care for hardships while Mick Bryan called me
PL WIFE ;
And when our little girl was born the touch of her soft hand
Made many thiugs seem clear that had been hard to under
? stand.
And th' iuside of that old slab hut that looks so rough to you
Was bright to me as morning sun upon the drops of dew ;
Ah well ! It didn't last for long. Perhaps it was too good
I might ha' got to value life far higher than I should.
The first hard stroke of trouble was just twenty years agone,
I mind as if 'twas yesterday the sunny summer morn,
They brought my poor Mick home. His face had just the
look of death,
And every time he sighed it might ha' been ""his parting
breath.
A doctor ? Oh, out here there wasn't mauy doctors then,
And so I had to sit and watch, and hope and watch again ;
The winter passed, and springtime came before he could sit
up; *
The hands were kiud, we never 'xactly wanted bit nor sup.
But still the children hadn't had the care they used to get,
And Tom and Katie both looked pale, and when it set in wet
They sickened, aud through day and night I did all I could
do,
And watched, and thought, and plauned, aud praye d, ye
through it all I knew
That death stood in the doorway. And one night as I sat
still
Aud heard thé sweet sad music come floating down the hill
That dear old mother used to call ' . the messenger of Death;""
I knew it came for Katie. Yes, I watched her fleeting breath.
Ah me ! She's better off ! Although its very hard to see
I used to think she'd always be a loving help to me.
And Tom, poor Tom, he went that night, my boy so bold
aud brave ;
Don't talk o' grief till you have laid two children in one
grave.
I often used to say to Mike 'twas but a little way
Between the life we're living here and everlasting day ;
Aud't seemed to me when they were gone, although I didn't
pine,
The best and bligh est half of me had crossed the narrow
line.
We'd only one left now, and that was tiny little Ted, .
He'd play beside his father as he lay upon the bed,
While I went to the creek to wash, or to the homestead
where
I often did a bit of work if visitors were there.
One night I came home tired ('twas shearing time), ano
when I saw
My poor Mike's face my heart stood still, 1 looked at hin
with awe ;
Awhile he couldn't speak, and then he pointed to the bed .
Where lay some scraps of wood and string, and then he
whispered "" Ted.""
I knew, 1 seemed to know at once that Ted was gone. I rar
And never stopped till all were roused. They turned out t(
a man,
And I went home to Mike. Poor Mike, he told me how he'e
made
The tiny paper windmill, and how Ted had laughed anc
played
To see the little toy spin round.-We watched, anc
watched all night,
Aud all next day, with heavy hearts, while still the sun shorn
bright.
By evening one by one the men had all come back, an<
when
The last one rode up silently, I looked at Mike and thei
1 saw that in his .face I never, never, saw before !
Oh husband, father, loving, true, thou 'rt with them ever
more.
And I must stay and silent wait, until the time shall come
When you, and I, and they, shall meet in an eternal home
They tell me that before he died he raised his eyes and said
"" Just wait a minute Katie, for I'm bringing little Ted.""
Just where the deep dark river speeds, by the overhaugin¡
rock,
We found, among a bed of ferns, the windmill and the sock
And they alone, and memory, are all that's left below
To tell of all I loved and lost so many years ago.

The recent misunderstanding between the departments
presided over by Messrs. Whitton and Cowdery, of the
railway service, has culminated in the appointment of
Commissioners, by whom the matters in dispute will be
investigatéd. The Government Gazette of the 6th inst,
had the following announcement: ''The undermen-

sion to inquire into and report upon the stability of
iron bridges erected on the existing lines of railway :

LOST IN THE BUSH.
AN AUSTRALIAN SKETCH.
Lost in the bush — the night encroaching fast,
And around loudening a cold-breathing blast!
A sad affair 'tis! Fancy squatter Will
Severely studying yon peculiar hill;
From which he learns a lesson of dismay —
It bluntly tells him, ""Thou host gone astray!""
At this he backward hastes, intent to find
Some prospect more familiar to his mind.
How puzzling 'tis! still stranger seems to grow
The backward scene o'er which he hurries so;
Whereat Will mutters scanning o'er the ground,
""Dang it! the world is surely twisted round!""
And then, with sudden jerk, the anxious swain
Turns, just to contemplate that hill again.
God! which is which? — a dozen summits lie
As like as eggs against the twilight sky.
With tart alarm, and comical surprise,
Will opes his mouth at this, and eke his eyes;
Squats on his hams, and strains his neck, thus bent,
And this way bobs his head,and that — intent
To put the pleasant fact to final test —
Which done, he draws his breath and mutters "" Well, I'm
blest!""
Scratches his head, and much that member loads
With execrations: ""What! forsake the roads
For shorter cuts, no near the day's decline,
'Mongst hills and brushes? — Drat this head of mine!
The night, I know, will fall as thick as mire,
The bush too's roaring like a world on fire!
I am not one much given to foolish frights,
And far too knowing to believe in sprites;
Yet such a night, in such a cursed place,
Might almost put one in a raving case:
And somewhere here, for certain, it is said
The blacks have burial — oh, this silly head!
Besides, Peg may forget to bed the sow,
Big Bess, that is so near her pigging now;
Nor can she by herself, with all her care,
Secure the stack from that downdacious mare;
Or pen those gallows calves up from the kine —
I must regain the road! — Oh, this thick head o' mine!""
Thus bringing into catalogue his woes,
On, dogg'd and desp'rate, he at random goes.
Ah Will, dame Fortune surely owes thee spite !
Thy blazing hearth shall know thee not to night !
Vainly thy Peggy watches for her Will
To loom in sight upon the 'customed hill,
Thus saying to herself, with gesture grim,
""He's boozing somewhere, but I'll give it him !'""
And just as vainly dost thou onward toil,
Dismally cooeying all the weary while,
And wish — how kind! that thou hadst there with thee
Thy neighbour Wilson — just for company.
Now thickest glooms blank every forest path,
And, like a large Cyclopian eye in wrath,
Two huddled masses of dark clouds between,
One only star glares wildly on the scene.
Those dun clouds streaking as he sails along,
The owl pours forward his funereal song;
Sounds of strange waters in the hollow blast,
With distant howlings, frequent come and fast;
Startingly near, and spectre-like to see,
Sharp-shrieking squirrels stream from tree to tree;
And the wild cat, with breath suspending rush,
Whisks like a devil from the shaken bush !
Ah Will, such hour may well thy spirit grieve,
Most woe-begone, unlucky son of Eve!
Worn out at length, he throws him down — and sleep
There finds him, coiled beside a bleaching heap
Of drifted leaves, which patteringly alight
From the hoarse blast — while, loaden with its might,
Huge trees sway solemn o'er th' unconscious wight.
But now, when night, a limping hag, her shades
Had westward called, and gray had grown the glades,
Stung into partial consciousness, 'twould seem,
By the increasing cold, he dreams a dream:—
Himthinks, a banished man, alone he fares
'Neath polar skies, and battles hard with bears,
Gigantic fellows! shagg'd with ice, and still
Dev'lishly bent on dishing squatter Will:
And, just as in the strife a leg is lost,
(That luckless leg most bitten by the frost)
Sweating and wild, he wakes. His face forlorn
Then rubbed, he looks and hails the wished-for morn;
Scans o'er the unknown scene wtth rueful eyes,
And folds his arms, and shakes his head, and sighs:
When hark! distinctly, although far away,
He hears some house-dog's thrice repeated bay —
Starts from his huddled pasture at a bound,
And joyful, pushes for the grateful sound.
Not long his search: for now the morning star
Wheels from the eastern steep her shining ear,
And in her pallid but effectual glow
A hut and clearing stand revealed below.
Thither he hastens, and is welcomed there,
Consoled and fed with hospitable care;
And when the sun shall crown the wintry day

rk 'l$Mw(¿f' VOr °£ ^ many a mile'
""~*Î?ÂÏÂ/ IIe didn't;run no palace
AB\ full of glass or silver
plate,
He didn't sport nc
Wf barmaid's ginget
But the ""strike-me-dead"" he gave you, and the
""scorch-your-soul"" was great, ..
And you felt your very boots begin to flare.
Oh, fusel-oil was water, and neat vitriol was tea,
To the stuff the old man manufactured there;
A spoonful was a dazzler, and a nobbler was a
spree,
While half-a-pint was horrors and to spare.
Whichever, way you travelled you would strike
that liquor's reek,
Three miles from where the old man's shanty
lay;
He had to put new iron on the building every
week,
The liquor fumes corroded it away.
The fame of this establishment went over all the
land,
Till it reached old Ironbarky Bill's abode;
It stirred up all his envy, so, says he, ""It would
be grand
To best that pub. upon Gilgyra-road.""
His throat was like a drainpipe, and his mouth
was like a sink,
To his stomach mere asbestos was a farce;
He dined on iron rivets hissing hot, and all his
drink .
Was nitric acid with a dash of glass.
Said he, ""I've drunk the country from the centre
to the sea,
I have drunk it hot, and cold, and wet, and dry;
Iii every blessed town of It I've had a flaring spree,
And I'm bound to best Gilgyra's pub. or die.""
So he rode away galoojus till he smelt the booze
afar,
And he sniffed it, like a horse that smells a
creek;
He whipped his nag, and drove the spurs, and gal
loped to the bar,
The old man stared, and wondered at his cheek.
Now when two champions haply meet within the
deadly breach,
And look into each other's eyes aright,
There is no need for more than that, no need for
any speech;
They know what kind of men they be-and fight.
So, when the old mah looked at Bill, and when,
like furnace blast,
Came forth the tropic cyclone of his breath,
He spoke no word, but turned around, and o'er
the counter passed
- A quart of most especial sudden death.
But ere the pewter touched that bar, it seemed
much lighter grown,
And when he looked down ÍD the empty cup, .
The old man gasped in sheer surprise to find the
liquor flown
Old Ironbarky's breath had dried it up.
Ile brought a gallon of his best rip-roaring, red
hot blend,
But,Billy just one mouthful of it made;
xS.nd as he set the measure down he murmured
sadly, ""Friend,
I didn't come this far for lemonade!""
The old man ground his teeth with rage; ""Ive got
a cask,"" said he, '
""That will knock you off your perch In half a
shake;""
""You're stuff's too mild,"" said Ironbark, ""to have
a decent spree;
. ? r A babe could drink the brand of booze you
mate.""
The old man rolled the barrel in. Said he: ""I'll
show you drink
That will give your little appetite a check.""
In vain, tho forty gallons lasted just half a wink,
""There's not enough,"" said he, ' ""to damp my
neck:""
""Bring, out the booze,"" cried William then, ""set
up the drinks again,
I'm thirstier than when I first began;""
But never answer did he get, for in the corner,
there.
The old man died-a broken-hearted man.
Bold Billy still is flourishing, but, happy though
he be,
He very very often stops to think
There's one thing unaccomplished.- * ""Now, be
for I die,"" says he,
""I'd like to ha_ve a satisfying drink.""

Where charming bush home scenes by peace

Tho' lorn fiom thy sorrowing friends
While youth breathes around thee its halcyon breath,

While virtuo and youth w arm the breast

Ere the memory shudders to gaze
On tho bavock of time, and the saddening gloom,
Whioh o'ershadows life's desolate days.
But over thv, tomb fond affection shall shed
The tear due to virtuo Uko thine ;
The sorrowing cypress shall wave o'er thy head,
And mark whëio thy fishes recline :
But thy spirit unfetter'd, and pure as the dove,
Shall triumph o'er death and the tomb
Shall return, swift as thought, to the "" Fountain of

TO THE MEMORY OF J.A.W
J.W.W.
BORN JUNE 9: DIED, 24. 1871.
AND thou art gathered for the skies, sweet flower of
promise fair:
And thou art chosen thus the crown without the cross
to wear;
Oh ! favored one, we joy for theo, that thou wUt never
kuow
That cross with all its weariness, its burden, and its woe
Ah : when we look'd with earnest love into thy youne
bright eyes, °
And traced in thought thy future course, thy pathway
to tho skies, J
We droa:ud of work prepared theehere. Alas! we little
knew
That Cod Himself was ttiting thee His work on high to
do.
He look into the summer sky, up through the clear
bright air ;
We gaze upon the midnight worlds, and think that thon
art there :
Yet is it well that we should deem our lost ones thus
afar,
Remote from all they loved below, liko some cold distant
star {
Nay, who shall say thou art not here, close to thy
mother's side,
Though hidden from her sorrowing sight and to her
arms denied ?
Who—who shall say that not to thee this mission hath
been given—
Her wandering steps to guard and guide nearer and
nearer heaven ?
Well diilst thou do thy work on earth throughout thy
little day;
The lightner of thy parents' hearts, the sunshine of their
way;
Ann now in mercy c'en to them, God may have giveu to
thee
A seraph's wing, that thou mayst still a better blessing
be.
The world unseen is surely near, upon its brink we
t cad;
The angels trace our daily paths, and watch around our
bed;
And dearer still than angels' care some loved one's guard
would be ;
We dare not say-but this we know-The Lord hath
need of thee.
Oh could we for one moment see thine heritage of joy,
And know, what here we seek in vain, a blias without
alloy;
That moment's gaze would hush the tears which still
for thee o'ernow,
Aud e-en thy mother's heart would be content that tbou
shouldst go.
That may not be—to see thee thus would be to walk by
Sight; *
And oh ! not so our souls are train'd to reach tho*e
realms of light;
But, taught of God, the chasten'd will, the meek sub
mission given,
Shall fit us by tliine early doom to shine with thee in
heaven.

Don't look for the flaws as you go through
life ;
And even when you find them,
It is wise and kind to be somewhat blind
And look for the virtue behind them.
For the cloudiest night has a hint of light
Somewhere in its shadows hiding ;
It is better by far to hunt for a star
Than the spots on the sun abiding.
The current of life runs ever away
To the bosom of God's great ocean.
Don't set y Our. force 'gainst the river's
course, 1 ??: ....
And think to alter its motion. t
Don't waste a curse on the universe
Remember, it lived before you.
Don't butt at the storm with your - puny
form

The world will never adjust itself
To suit your whims to the letter;:ï
Some things must go wrong your whole

the bbeath of the bush.
The hush of the night is upon me,
I have done with the might-have-been,
Yet ever a brook is crooning
In a forest of gold and green;,
And a voice that I know is calling
With the minahs from tree to tree-*
The tender, human voice of one
Who was all the world to me!
0! to follow her springing step
O'er the emerald breast nOhe wold,
Where the buttercups spangle the soft
green grass,
And the woods of the fern unfold!
0! for the Bcent of the flowering shrubs
That are wet with the sweet spring rain,
For the breath- of the musk and the sassa
fras
I never shall see again!
The fairy laugh of the leaves rings yet
In a silvery shower of sound,
The dew is ashimmer with golden light
On every mossy mound;
Down in the hollow the daisies dream,
And the violet's winsome face
Looks fragile and fair ae the maidenhair
In the charm of its dainty grace.
I hear the voice of the little creek,
And its musical monotone
Blends with the murmur of far-off brooks
In a song that is weird and lone.
Yet the joy of life's in the clear, pure air,
And the birds sing wild and high,
Their whirring wings are like soft harp
strings
The sky's deep blue anigh!
When the fever of youth is over,
And we'rt left hut the light of a star
Ere we ford the river of silence
That leads to the land afar,
Is there bliss or pain in remembrance
That clearer and clearer beams,
Of the days when the best within us
Was the glamour and glow of dreams?
Ah, God! for the olden glory,
For an hour of the happy past
Ere the flickering light'* and shadows
Are over for us at last!
But a mem'ry of love and brightness
Is all that we may retain—
And the flowers from heights immortal
That were plucked by the hand of pain!

Oh ! Thou who nonrißhest the stricken soul
When crushed by cold negloot of heartless man»
Lookdown upon this being ! Short theapan
Whioh now retains hin within Time's control !
Seasons unnumbered pass, wild tempests roll,
Earthquakes and lightnings, wonders of earth
and air,
He heedeth not, he knoweth not ; for oare
Hath bowed him to the dust. Hia senses reel,
His footsteps totter aB he Beens the ßhore,
Where the pent waters thro' lone oavernB roar
To (raia the boundless sea-from whenae first driven
They mount to hiss the stars, and dash the spray
towards Heaven !

He had a son-a blue-eyed.gentle ohild.
In days agone, when he himself was young,
And loved the world, and smiled and danged and
t Bung .,,
With gladsome heart. But, oh I adventurers wild
Entered his home, and, ruthle*B, lured away
The darling of his soul, whose mother lay
Within the tomb, nor saw her son beguiled
To flee a tender sire's proteoting hand.
And mínele with a vile, blaspheming throng,
Who dwelt, a plague-epot, in his native land,
Blasting yonng innocence ; while borne along,
He vainly struggled-as when torrents roar,'
And bear some mountain shepherd, battling for the
shore !
III.
And while the stream of vice still onward bore,
He felt repentance, wept, and sinned again !
Till time passed on ; repentanoo seemed in vain.
And still he viewed the far-rooeding shore '
(The smiling ever-pleasant shore of truth,
Where, whilst intact, his soul rejoioed iii youth),
But trod upon its pleasant paths no more !
Tossed on tho bosom of a doubtful ocean,
j He gave himself to pleasure-false tho name,!
j The paat forgot, unwept his sire's emotion,
He basely lived and bade adieu to shame,
I Till foul disease, with life-destroying breath',
Passed o'er the wanderer's oouch, and doomed his
frame to death.
IV.
Still was he loved-not cursed, as many ara
(Tho only gift that to hie sire was given.
By her ho loved, ere yet she passed to Heaven) I
And whilst the wanderer dwelt in sin afar
i The sire, tho' young, bowed down by bitter
, care,
! With furrowed brow, and lightly Bil verod hair,
Sent forth a letter as a guiding star
To lead the err in ir one. Bat, ah ! too late !
The words of pardon found him in the grave..
And long and patient did the parent wait,
Nor deemed the wild weeds yet could o'er him wave,
Until a letter came-his own again,
Returning messenger, to charge his soul with pain !
V.
He gazed upon it once. Enough-he knew
The trembling characters noon it traced
Were writ by his own hand j and half-effaoed,
By burning, scalding tears, the emblems true
Of deep, parental love-that love whioh dwells
Within a father's boacm when it swells
A breaking heart for a loved child disgraoed.
Thenceforward beauty never met his eyes
Earth's blossoms, trees and sunshine, what were
they ?
What were the still ni«ht's starry, cloudless .

SHIPS OF HOPE.
The Ships of Hope are sailing
To meet the sea to-day,
Tin? dimpling roadstead whitens
Beneath their brave array.
Young breezes fill their canvas.
That swells like rounded pearls,
Each scarlet, silken pennon
A gay defiance hurls.
Beyond Home's happy haven
Life's 6urge beats ou 'the shore;'
Behind, the landlocked harbourj
Uncharted seas before.
All. bells may ring thanksgiving
Amid the inerry din.
If still with sails unsullied
The Ships of Hope come in.
The Ships of Hope, returning,
Are beating up the bay:
But some are sore disabled,
And some were cast away.
And some, faint-hearted, foundered
For Jack of star to guide.
And some have passed unspoken
And drifted down the tiae.
With pennons scant and tattered,
With ragged sails and thin,
A broken brave Armada,
The Ships of Hope come in.
King, ring ye bells, your dirges,
The sea hath reft her due,
Befit ye. for vour voyage.
Ye gallant barques and true.
Tiie seas are yet to conquer.
The wide, wide seas and lone,,
The voyage, long and wear}*,
With diverse perils sown.
The reefs have fangs to pierce ye,
The sea hath depths to hold,
Your freight of brave endeavour
Is more than gear or gold.
But. oh, my barque stout-hearted,
Hide out the storms and win,
Ah. grant that all unfailing.
My Ship of Hope comes in!

How often in the silent night
When others calmly rest,
Does mem'ry in her backward flight
Perturb my wakeful breast.
I think of all that I have been
And all I now might be,
Had crime not placed a bar between
Home, freedom, friends and me.
The days-the years-I have misus'd-'
The devious path I've trod
Talents, tho' humble, yet abus'd
Have alivu'd me from God.
Whilst she who bore me in her womb
Who nurs'd my infant years,
An aged widow-wails my doon
In solitude and tears.
0 God ! of all the pangs that e'er
Distract the guilty heart,
The having caused a mother's tears
Gives far the keenest smart.
Ah wherefore did I ever leave
The life I led in youth.
Why suffer error to deceive
And lure me from the truth.
Religion! had thy holy pow's
For ever rul'd my breast,
I ne'er had felt this friendless hour
Lone, exil'd and distresses
'Tis not too late-on bended knog
To Christ this very day,
In genuine humility
# For a new heart I pray.
He never scorns the coatrite sigh,
The anguish'd, broken hearted tear,
The uplift hand, the down cast eye
Betok'ning penitence sincere'.
Then cease to throb my flutt'ring heart
Humbly rely on God,
He portions to thy strength the smart,
Of his soul-chast'ning rod.",The Hobart Town Courier ,"542,493,432,617,481,528,422,628,557,683,468,551,468,642,494,573,367,574,430,605,662,532,410,473,488,517,436,593,483,599,418,354,487,588,621,627,514,677,369,667,455",Sat 18 Feb 1832,"4597,4677,4717,4757,4798,4858,4899,4939,4979,5034,5077,5116,5154,5211,5252,5292,5334,5392,5432,5469,5508,5571,5611,5651,5691,5747,5787,5827,5865,5926,5964,6006,6048,6106,6146,6187,6224,6283,6326,6366,6399","3195,3115,3153,3116,3155,3115,3157,3117,3161,3119,3160,3118,3164,3124,3165,3125,3165,3130,3167,3129,3168,3129,3170,3133,3172,3134,3175,3141,3181,3134,3177,3138,3106,3143,3183,3142,3183,3144,3188,3149,3190",4200160,Page 4

A Little Book on the Origin and Nature of
Poetry, by the Scrubb Family--the Prose by
Timothy, and the Poetic Illustrations by
Jeremiah.
CHAP. V.
Othello's occupation's gone.--Bard of Avon.
This chapter opens with a great flourish of
trumpets, a tremendous revolution in poetry, and
a terrible blow to professional criticism. In fact,
I mean to suggest to all suffering bards an
effectual cure for the evils incident to their pre-
sent situation, as well as to foment a rebellion
against the unjust and odious domination of re-
viewers. I hope, therefore, to obtain a patient
hearing from all living poets, and also from all
who intend to court the muse at some future
time. I do not doubt but that I shall be re-
garded as a benefactor of the species; for,
assuredly, the panacea which I have to promulge,
will not only revolutionise every department of
rhyme, but also be of inestimable advantage to
every son and daughter of song.
Evey bard is doubtless aware that, under
existing circumstances, his reputation depends on
the authoritative dicta of reviewers. Unfor-
tunately, the public take very little interest in
the fate of poetical works, and hence, numbers of
people estimate the merits of books in accordance
with some reviewer's testimony. He reads--or,
at least leads those who read him to suppose that
he reads--the various works which he reviews,
and, as his readers do not read such works, they
naturally adopt his conclusions and act accord-
ingly. If he condemns, they condemn; if he
praises, they praise; and the tone of their praise
or blame is regulated in a great measure by the
tone of his critique. Under such circumstances
an ill-treated poet has no fair chance for fame.
Nobody regards him as a great man, simply be-
cause nobody reads his works. Of what use are
all his beautiful apostrophes, astounding com-
parisons, and splendid passages! They might as
well have been written for the moths and beetles
to mutilate and destroy, as for reasonable men to
read. They are tabooed to the public; they have
the ban of the critic on them; they are
labelled ""not to be read;"" and the writer of
them, instead of commanding the applause of
multitudes, glides down the stream of life as
noiselessly as an ordinary man. Though this is
a hard case, it is far from being irremediable.
It is not like those chronic diseases which baffle
the skill of the most experienced physicians, and
tempt them to doubt the power of the Esculapian
art. In this instance, ""hic jacet need not finish
what recipe begins;"" although such is the fate of
most persons who abandon Professor Holloway.
The case of the ill-used bard is not hopeless.
There is as much blue sky over his head as would
make a pair of breeches for a Dutchman. The
clouds are breaking in the boundless heavens.
The storm has done its worst, and must now be
hushed for ever. The sagacity of my uncle has
discovered a sure and efficacious remedy for all
the critical ills that bards are heirs to, and that
remedy is comprised in the advice--let every
poet become his own critic.
That the adoption of this plan would be pro-
ductive of many important advantages, is a
proposition, the truth of which is transparently
evident. It would enable the bard to point out
to the reader all the beautiful passages and lovely
metaphors in his work; and which the reader
might otherwise omit to notice. It would afford
him an opportunity of magnifying his candour in
the reader's esteem, for, on this plan, he would
be enabled to note those parts of the poem which
were poor, bald, and thin, and which hed been
inserted for the sole purpose of showing that a
great mind, like a great mountain, has chasms
and hollows in it. But the greatest advantage
of all would consist in the fortification of the
reader's mind against future defamatory criti-
cism. The generality of readers receive their
opinions on the shopkeeping principle of ""first
come first served,"" or, in other words, imbibe
whatever views may be first laid
before them. Hence, when about to
commence the perusal of a poem,
their minds may be compared to Locke's tabula
rasa, or more accurately, to a sheet of foolscap,
on which the bard may register almost any
opinion he pleases; and, when they once form an
opinion, their natural stiff-neckedness forces them
to retain it with surprising tenacity. By taking
advantage of these peculiarities and idiosyncra-
cies of the reading public, the poet would make
the very obstinacy of human nature an auxiliary
to his success; and a clique of such readers would
pooh-pooh, and put down all hostile criticism,
and give such an impulse to the bard's fame as
would suffice to send it puffing, and splashing,
and snorting like a steam-boat down the broad
ocean of posterity and time. My uncle Jeremiah
will now practically illustrate, both in prose and
song, this important discovery.
THE WOODMAN'S CHILD.
An Australian Tale, founded on a fact which
the writer imagined.
CANTO I.
N.B.--The reader is particularly requested to
observe that this story is intended to be very
pathetic.
The setting sun a rosy light
Flung o'er creation's wide domain;
And, thron'd on stars, the monarch night
In solemn state began her reign.
The bittern pip'd her shrilly song,
The dingo dog forsook his lair,
And darkness slily stole along
The dusky woods, and sleeping air.
Then sail'd not a cloud o'er the vault on high,
To dim the glow of the starlit sky;
There stray'd not across the forest a breeze,
To stir the tops of the highest trees;
No ripple play'd upon the rill;
No mist hung o'er the brush-clad hill;
No light shone on the weeping stream,
Save that of the pale sidereal beam;
For the sovereign lord of the day had set,
And the merry moon had not risen yet,
And darkness reign'd on every hand,
And silence brooded o'er the land.
This scrap of song serves to introduce the story
to the reader. It excites curiosity, and prompts
the inquiry--what next? What follows in the
next four lines is put in because the writer could
find nothing better to say, and, what follows in
the subsequent four is added with a view of roman-
ticising the flatness of the allusion to the clock, &c.
As I have undertaken to criticise myself, I con-
sider it my duty to acknowledge my poetic frail-
ties, as well as to appreciate and laud my
surpassing excellencies; and therefore hope, that
should the reader be unable to admire my poetry,
he will, at least, be compelled to praise my can-
dour and discernment. Thus I shall gain my
end, to wit, his admiration, either by hook or by
crook.
The woodman's clock, with heavy stroke,
Portentously the silence broke,
And echo from a neighbouring rock
Responded to the warning clock.
The passing stranger heard the sound,
And with quicken'd steps pursu'd his way;
For many a weary mile of ground
Between him and his homestead lay.
In the next part of the poem the story begins.
The only purpose which this introduction can
serve is, that of showing the time when the story
opens. Scene--Night--would have done just as
well, but then it would have been a too matter
of fact sort of introduction to an octa-syllabic
drama. Had I plunged into the story at once,
the imagination of the reader would not have
been appropriately excited. I have avoided this
defect by noting the principal features of the
scene; and, also, by the introduction of the
passing stranger. What business that stranger
had there--who he was--and where he came from
--are questions which the reader's imagination
must answer. This vagueness is what all modern
critics admire in Coleridge's ""Christabel;"" though
strange to say, they admire the very
opposite in Wordsworth. My business, as
a bard, is, to follow the advice
which Sir Walter Scott gave to a celebrated
painter of battle scenes--""Just put in a leg here,
and an arm there, and raise a great stour (dust),
and leave the rest to fancy."" My tale will now
run on very smoothly to the end of all the
cantos.
The shout of childhood's revelry
Was heard around the woodman's fire
And one cherub boy, laughing merrily,
Clamber'd upon his father's knee,
And looked in the face of his sire,
Alas! alas! that blue-eyed boy,
With a face all smiles, and a voice all joy,
And a heart as merry as heart could be,
Stood then on the verge of eternity;
And drew in laughter his latest breath,
In the hollow that lies 'twixt time and death.
O! life is a state of uncertainty;
There is poison-juice in the fairest flowers;
There's a sting near the bag of the honey-bee,
And a cloud on the face of our brightest hours.
There's a bitter dreg in the cup of joy;
There's a canker worm in the calmest mind;
The sweetest pleasure hath some alloy,
And life and death are intertwin'd.
We rise and sleep, we laugh and sing,
Like flowers, we put forth all our bloom;
Like flowers, a stroke of Time's strong wing
Consigns us to an early tomb.
The woodman's child took his father's hand--
The father press'd and held it fast;
For a sad presentiment unmann'd
His soul: as when the vengeful blast
And bounding billows, and angry sky,
Flash on the shipwreck'd sailor's eye,
And paralyse his stalwart frame,
And, all but, quench life's sinking flame,
And fill his soul with horrent fear,
And tell him death--stern death is near.
Two hours had fled since the setting sun
Proclaimed the approach of the dreamy night,
And the deed of blood had not been done,
Though the victim sate in the murderer's sight,
For, crouch'd behind a ragged stone,
Like a fierce and deadly beast of prey,
In silence, and sin, and all alone,
With 'bated breath the murderer lay;
And he held his rifle on the cock,
And drew from his leathern belt a knife,
Which he savagely whetted upon the rock,
For he sought the woodman's life.
The one had married a maiden fair,
Whom the other loved too well,
And the latter swore by the Prince of Air,
That if ever he met the woodman where
No eye could see, he a deed would dare
Too horrible to tell.
And now some demon fate had brought
Him close to the foe whese life he sought,
Had chosen the weapon, place, and time,
Befitting so foul a deed of crime--
Had seal'd the conscious eye within
To the dreary issue of his sin--
Had fired his soul with ruthless hate,
Which ruin only could abate.
And by the fire's blazing light,
He rais'd his piece and took deadly aim,
And there shot athwart the brow of night,
A sudden flash of lurid flame.
The night-hawk, screaming, swept the sky,
And from under the shelt'ring stone's broad base
There issu'd a faint and hissing cry,
As a snake look'd full in the murd'rer's face;
And hollow laughter rang around
The cavern'd hills and forest wide,
While distant mountains caught the sound
And in hollower tones to it replied.
The deed of blood was rashly done,
The wreath of darkness madly won,
The murd'rer's hellish vow was cross'd,
The father liv'd, the child was lost.
As he on his father's name did call,
And press'd his cheek with lip so red,
A flash was seen, and a rifle ball
Flew, crashing, through the boarded wall,
And the cherub boy lay dead.
O! then the forest echoes woke,
With the shriek of a mother's anguish wild!
And her cheek grew wan, and her heart was broke,
And she sank beneath the fatal stroke--
For it was her first-born child!
O, ye! who sound the depths of space,
And trace with philosophic eye
The unknown planet's fitting place
In the vast obscure o' the starry sky,
And ye! who know all living things
That swim beneath the ocean's tide,
Or, cleave the air with joyous wings,
Or on the breath of evening glide;
And ye! who on the marble breathe
Life's all but stern reality;
Or round your brows a chaplet wreathe
With sweetest flowers of poesy.
Say! can you on the block pourtray,
Or on the canvass pencil fair,
Or sound, in high poetic lay,
That heart-struck mother's dread despair?
There's a grief that crushes the strongest heart,
As corn is crush'd by thunder rain;
There's a sorrow too deep for the poet's art,
And which highest song would but profane!
CANTO II.
Away! away! to the mountain glen!
Unvisited by the feet of men!
Where the brush is thick, and the crags are rude,
And the silver streamlet sadly moans
As it winds along in mournful mood,
O'er beds of shale, and moss-clad stones.
Where monstrous snakes their vigils keep,
And in hollow oaks rank lizards sleep;
Where the laughing squirrel leaps in the dark,
From the topmost boughs of the ironbark,
Where scarlet flowers their bloom display
To the eager parrot's observing eye,
And the woods resound, at the dawn of day,
With the Waunga-Waunga's plaintive cry;
Where kangaroos and opossums feed,
And wild birds cheerily wing their flight,
And mountain blossom and verdant weed
Adorn the cracks in the stalagmite;
And nature frowns in sternest mood
On the vast unbroken solitude.
Away! away! to the mountain glen,
Where the wild dog sleeps in his strong den;
Where the prickly shrub sheds sweet perfume;
Where the mountain rose displays its bloom;
Where bronze-wing'd pigeons swiftly sweep,
O'er stunted pine and tow'ring steep;
Where the wintry torrent's foaming wave
Leaps through the halls of the schistose cave;
Where the snowy eagle plumes his wing,
And the thunder shouts like a living thing,
And vernal storms their force display,
Then away to the mountain glen! away.
Away! away! to the wilderness
The murderer spurr'd his jaded steed!
Revenge was sated with success,
And his inmost soul began to bleed.
And he saw at hand, and on every side,
A vision of a murder'd child,
Whose yellow locks with blood were dyed,
As it spurted out in a living tide,
And he shrunk from a sight so wild.
He spurr'd again, and onward dashed
Away to the lonely mountain waste,
But the vision still before him flash'd,
As if it mock'd his haste.
And when he reached his hiding-place,
And the rising moon just show'd her face,
And had bath'd his brow in a mountain rill,
And stretched himself on a lonely hill,
'Twas there, behind a ragged stone,
Just such as he knelt by hours before,
When in silence and sin, and all alone,
The skies were rent with his rifle's roar.
He tried to sleep, but tried in vain.
Remorseful tear-drops banish'd rest,
And horror with its harpy train,
His sinful soul possess'd.
The bright and blessed morn arose,
And with fragrance sweet embalm'd the air;
But it shed no balm to heal his woes,
Nor cast a ray on his despair.
And whichever way he turn'd his eye,
It met the gaze of the murder'd child;
Now, it shone like a star on the sky,
Anon, it lay on the earth and smil'd;
One moment, it stood on the mountain steep,
The next, 'twas gilding among the trees;
And, at last, it seal'd his eyes in sleep,
As it floated by on a passing breeze.
The murd'rer slept in his stony hall,
Such sleep as might come to a wretch like him;
While unearthly hands, an unearthly pall,
Spread over each weary and stalwart limb.
And as he slept, he dreamt a dream
Which fill'd his soul with terror wild;
He woke, and at that moment, a lightning gleam
Disclosed the face of the murder'd child.
When slumber o'er his senses stole,
Despair forsook his guilty soul,
But when he from that slumber woke,
Horror again on his spirit broke,
Hope fled for aye, and with it, joy,
Crush'd by the frown of the murder'd boy,
Who still beside his murd'rer kept,
Whether he woke, or whether he slept;
Like a wrathful vision, in vengeance sent,
A guilty conscience to torment.
""O, who can bear this horrid curse?
What heart endure this vision dread?
Death with its terrors can't be worse!
Nor what is after death!"" He said.
Then bounding off, like a stricken deer,
Away through the waste of the lonely glen,
He perish'd, where none could shed a tear,
Nor mourning kinsman dress his bier;
The last sad offices due to men.
Oblivious time had onward sped,
And, as it roll'd, had left a trace
Of snow upon the woodman's head--
Of age upon his rustic face.
Just seventeen summers wing'd their flight
From that disastrous, starlit, night,
When heav'n, illum'd with a rifle's flash,
Beheld a murd'rer hotly dash
Through brush and brake, o'er field and flood,
Along the hill, and through the wood,
With whip and spur, on foaming steed,
Away from the scene of his daring deed.
Just seventeen years had rolled away,
When on a sultry summer day,
Chance led the woodman's feet to roam
(Far from his solitary home)
To the very spot, and the very den,
In the silent, lonely, mountain glen,
Where the murd'rer of his first-born child,
Had slept, and woke, in terror wild.
And as he slowly wound along,
He stumbled o'er a pile of stones,
And found beside them, and among,
A human skull and human bones.
They bore the mark of the wild dog's tooth,
They harmonis'd with the scenes uncouth,
That stretch'd around on ev'ry side,
And fill'd the mountain landscape wide.
And 'neath the edge of a ragged stone,
In contact with a finger bone,
Which on the trigger once had been,
Which gave the fatal pull, I ween,
There lay a long and rusty knife,
Still stain'd with the crimson tide of life,
And on the handle was a name,
The shudd'ring woodman knew too well!
Twas his, who fir'd with deadly aim,
On the starlit night that a cherub fell!
It is quite evident that I might have stayed
my poetical career at the conclusion of the first
canto, and have allowed the reader's imagination
to have finished the story. Had I done so, how-
ever, I would have been guilty of flying in the
face of poetical justice. To hang the villanous
hero of the tale, immediately after the committal
of his awful deed, would have been a very common-
place method of getting rid of him; and would
moreover, have been far too like the Draconic be-
nevolence of modern legislators. I was, therefore,
obliged to conduct him into the lonely wilderness,
and there compel him to become his own execu-
tioner. In the management of this important
matter I have carefully avoided explicitness,
because I consider explicitness as the evil genius
of poetry. Vagueness and obscurity are the
staple elements of rhyme. The poet ought
merely to supply the skeleton of the story, and
leave the fancy of the reader to clothe that skele-
ton with flesh and blood, and skin. This is the
very thing which I have done; and, by doing it,
have the merit of transforming the reader into a
poet by the stimulus which I have given to his
imagination.
In no part of the poem is this vagueness more
conspicuous than in the allusions to spiritual
agency. On this topic I have spoken obscurely from
necessity. Australia is a most unpoetic place.
From Cape Leeuwin to Cape York there is not
so much as a single goddess. We have no
witches, no kelpies, no brownies, no spunkies, no
leprechawns, and, worse than all, ""no good
people."" I have seen many queer-looking folks
in Sydney, but I never saw a ghost there; nor
have I ever heard of a haunted house having
been discovered in any corner of our huge island.
It is true that we have a god, but he is too yellow
for poetry, and would, if put into a rhyme, make
it look as if it had the jaundice. Besides, it is
almost impossible to get hold of him, for the
common people are so devotedly attached to his
person that they always carry him about with
them buttoned up in their pockets. Under such
circumstances, it was impossible to do more
than obscurely allude to the spiritual beings
that spread an invisible pall over the som-
nolent murderer. The very obscurity of these
allusions, however, will render them applicable to
any spiritualities that may be discovered here-
after; and thus the poem may be truly charac-
terised as written for all time.
And now, courteous teador, ere I finish this
critique, permit me to say a word or two on a
subject that lies very near my heart, namely, my
own surpassing merits us a poet. As I have un-
dertaken the task of criticising my own works, it
is imperatively necessary that I should do
justice to this point. In common, then,
with every son and daughter of song, I do
regard my own poetry as uncommonly
beautiful. Others may dissent from my views on
this head, but what of that? Is not censure the
tax which great men invariably pay for being
great? Do not owls hoot at the sun? Do not
swallows twitter around hawks? Do not dogs bay
the moon, and fleas nibble lions? And, are not
men proverbially envious, shallow-pated, cen-
sorious, and malignantly critical? Believe me,
gentle reader, that I would rather be a kitten,
crying mew, or a snail, travelling up a cabbage
leaf, than rank high in the estimation of those
who are incapable of appreciating true merit.
Hence the opinion of would-be critics, with respect
to my status in thd poetical world, scarcely
costs me thought. Men who agree with me
display, by that agreement, their taste and dis-
cernment; and men who dissent from my views
--why, they merely display their narrowness and
obliquity of judgment, I am independent of the
applauses of the world; I can applaud myself.
And even should you, courteous reader, grumble
at the little book, I shall always attribute yonr
displeasure to the fact that I have very properly
taken the business of criticism out of your hands,
and vested it in the proper authority, to wit, the
bard himself--who is henceforth to be regarded as
the only person competent to judge of his own
merits.
END OF THE LITTLE BOOK.
SIR ASTLEY COOPER.--It has often been re-
marked that some circumstance, apparently ac-
cidental, has tended to influence the future career
of those concerned; and an anecdote is told of
Sir Astley, which, if true, seems to bear out this
idea. It is said that, when a boy, he saw a lad
fall from a cart, and tear his thigh in such
manner as to wound the femoral artery. Our
young hero immediately took his handkerchief,
applied it round the thigh, and twisted it so
tightly as to control the bleeding till further
assistance could be procured. Sir Astley received
some very large fees, among which, not the least
remarkable was that of a thousand guineas
thrown at him in his night cap, by a patient
whom he had cut for the stone: an anecdote
which he told with no small degree of animation,
on retiring from a patient upon whom he had just
performed the same operation, and who had like-
wise, in his agony, flung his cap at the surgeon,
but without it containing, on this occasion, the
cheque which gave so much force to the original
incident. In 1815, when at the height of
his reputation, he removed to Spring-gardens;
and he was one of the few with whom the migra-
tion from the City to the West-end proved fully
successful. A few years afterwards, he was
employed professionally by George IV. to remove
a small tumor from the scalp: an operation which
he performed with all his wonted coolness and
dexterity. Probably, no surgeon of ancient or
modern times enjoyed a greater share of reputa-
tion during his life than fell to the lot of Sir
Astley. The Old and New World has alike rung
with his fame; and we cannot give a better ex-
ample of this than the fact of his signature being
received as a passport among the mountains of
Biscay by the wild followers of Don Carlos. A
young English surgeon, seeking for employment,
was carried as a prisoner before Zumalacarrequi,
who demanded what testimonials he had of his
calling or his qualifications? Our countryman
presented his diploma of the College of Surgeons;
and the name of Astley Paston Cooper, which was
attached to it, no sooner struck the eye of the
Carlist leader, than he at once received his
prisoner with friendship, and appointed him a
surgeon in his army. Sir Astley long enjoyed a
large share of public patronage; but we believe
the actual amount of his fortune, when stated at
half a million, is considerably over-rated. His
personal expenses were not great; but he was very
liberal to his relations, on whom, we have heard,
on what we believe to be good authority, that he
bestowed between two and three thousand pounds
annually. He is also said to have spent £20,000
in bringing his brother into Parliament. Nor
was his liberality confined to his own family.
When Dr. Baillie and some others made up a
purse for Dr. Pemberton in the difficulties
brought upon him by his ill-health, Sir Astley
contributed the munificent sum of £500.
THEATRICAL WIT.--Hatton, who was a consi-
derable favourite at the Haymarket Theatre, and
particularly in the part of Jack Junk, was one
night at Gosport, performing the character of
Barbarossa. In the scene when the tyrant makes
love to Zapphira, and reminds her of his services
against the enemies of her kingdom, he was at a
loss, and could not catch the word from the
prompter. Another moment and a terrific hiss
would have driven him from the stage, when,
seeing the house crowded with sailors, and re-
gardless of the gross anachronism, he exclaimed,
with all the energy of tragedy--
-----------Did not I,
By that brave knight Sir Sydney Smith assisted
And in conjunction with the gallant Nelson,
Drive Bonaparte and his fierce marauders
From Egypt's shores?
The jolly tars thought that it was all in his part
and cheered the actor with three rounds of
applause.
RARE VIRTUE.--The paucity of some persons'
good actions remind one of Jonathan Wild, who
was once induced to be guilty of a good action,
after fully satisfying himself, upon the maturest
deliberation, that he could gain nothing by refrain-
ing from it.",Empire

"" My Father it the husbandman.""—John xv., v. 1—8.
A HUSBANDMAN with careful hand.
In pruning vines much time does spend,
That fruitful shoots they all may send.

Not one of all is He to miss.
Before His eye* all hare to come,
And there --wait the Anal doom—

O what a eomf'-rt when we fonnd
a Onr dear one wbo was homeward bound.
That the wis resting on firm ground.
Yet: firm and faithful she did cling.
Until her ■pirit took the wing;;
Hallelujah the still did sing.
She has departed for a time
To God's own presence aU divine—
The heavenly Fruner pruned the vine-
She left to us this let-tar—
""You all in time will beVith mt,
Then we shall tee the mystery. ""

Three angels stood by ber bed>ide.
And all look'd beautiful and bright.

Hohob tottb Bvstvbss.—lt is a good sign
when a man is proud of his work or calling.
Tet nothing is more common than to hear men
finding fault constantly with tbeir particular
business, and deeming themselves unfortunate
because fastened to it by the necessity of
gaining a livelihood. In thia men fret, and
laboriously destroy all their comfort in the work;
or they change their buaineit, and go on miser
ably, shifting from one thing to another till the
grave or the poor-house gives them a fast grip.
But while occasionally a man fails in life because
he is not in the place fitted for his peculiar
talent, it happens ten timea oftener that failure
results from neglect and even contempt of an
honest business. A msn shonld put his heart
into everything tbat he does. There is no pro
fession that has not its peculiar cares and vexa
tions. No man will e-cape annoyance by chang
ing his business. No mechanical business is
altogether agreeable. Commerce, in ita endless
varieties, it affected, like all other pursuits, with
trials, unwelcome duties, and spirit-tiring neoet
sities. It is the very wantonness of folly for a
man to search ont the frets and burdens of bis
calling, and give bis mind every day to a con
sideration of them. They belong to human life.
They are.inevitable. Brooding over them only
gives them strength. On the other hsnd, a
man has power given him to shed beauty and
pleasure on the homeliett toil, if be it wise. Let
a man adopt his business and identify it with
pleasant associations; for Heaven has given us
imagination, not alone to make us poets, but to
enable all men to beautify homely thingt.
Heart-varniih will cover up innumerable evila
and defectt. Look at the good thingt. Accept
your lot as a man doea a piece of rugged ground,
and begin to get out the roota and rocka, to
deepen and mellow the soil, to enrich and plant
it. There is something in the most forbidding
avocation around which a man may twine plea
sant fancies, out of which he may develop an
honest pride.
Thb Islabus nr Bass Stbaits.—Of Cape
Barren Island, Bast tayi: ""The rocks were
covered with fur seals of great beauty, of a
tpeciei approaching; nearest that named by na
turalists ss the Falkland Island seal"" And
Flinders gives a more particular description of
them. In speaking of Cone Point, on the ex
treme S.E. or Cape Barren Island, hia words
are: "" The number of teals exceeded everything
we had any of ua before witnesaed, and they
were smaller *>nd of a different species from
those which frequented Armstrong's Channel.
Instead of the bulldog note and thinly-set
sandy hair, these hid sharp-pointed noses, and
the general color of the hair approached to black,
but the tips were of a silver grey, and under
neath waa a fine, whitish, tbick fur. The com
motion excited by our pretence, in this assem
blage of several thousand timid animali, was
very interesting to me who knew little of their
manners. The young cubs huddled together
in the holes of the rocks und moaned piteously;
those more advanced scampered and rolled down
to the water with their mothers; while some of
the old vale* stood up in defence of tbeir fami
lies, until the terror of the tailors' bludgeons
became too strong to be resitted. Thote who
bave seen a farm yard well stocked with pigs,
calves, sheep, oxen,.and with two or three Utters

Madaoascab.—Few geographical researchei
of modern times hare been more interest ing
than those carried on in Madagascar by It. A.
Orandidier, whether we consider our previous
ignorance of tbe region in quettion, or the num
ber of striking and important tcientifio novelties
brought to light. Thii gentleman has lately
returned from his third expedition, the first
having been commenced in 1865. On this oc
casion he attempted to reach tbe heart of the
island, but in vain; and in the following year
he explored the southern region, but did not
reach the mountain!. In 1869-70, however, he
traversed tbe entire breadth of the itland three
times, from wett to east, through its whole ex
tent, making various lateral excursions to inter
esting pointt, and vititing the peak of the
mountain Ankaararatre, the hijheat tummit in
Madagascar. According to M. Grandidier'a re
port, Madagascar comprises two diitinct regions
—the northern, which ia mountaiuout, and that
to the south and east, which ia flat. He ascer
tained that there are fire chains of mountains,
which have generally the same direction—
namely, from north-east to south west. These
are separated by sand* and arid plains, inter
sected by shallow ravinei. After crotting the
fourth chain, a region it reached of which the
general level it from 1000 to 1200 meteri in
height, extending to the Indian Ocean, a vait
sea of mountains, with no level lands except a
few small valleys used for the cultivation of rice.
The eastern coast it intersected at almost every
step with rivers and torrents *, and the north
western provinces pour into the sea a large
number of important rivers. On the southern
and western regions, however, the case it quite
different, there being dittances of fifty leaguea
without the smallest brook. The reputation
poeeeaaed by Madagascar for luxuriant vegeta
tion and fertile soil, according sa M. Orandidier,
is by no means merited, its provinces being
neither rich nor productive. The secondary
plains are sterile, and tbe population is con
fined to the immediate banks of tbe water
courses. The entile matt of tbe granitic
mountains, situated to ibe west of the eastern
slope, is naked and arid, and there is no vegeta
tion, excepting here and there little bunches
growing in tbe ravines.— Harper's Weekly.",The Queenslander ,"568,240,861,565,650,784,556,541,451,532,534,748,534,683,592,589,498,457,443,567,619,430,551,517,539,553,588,650,607,445,619,458,506,670,655,482,535,605,605,750,656,552,513,749,575,625,569,572,557,706,471,395,871,77,863,906,901,904,901,908,900,900,882,902,899,901,900,899,896,901,879,876,877,899,899,897,880,901,901,882,900,900,901,903,901,899,901,901,898,899,900,899,899,900,898,882,898,237,856,897,897,877,896,902,882,899,901,899,898,900,901,901,898,879,879,875,901,901,901,902,900,906,884,903,901,899,903,901,901,901,879,900,901,882,897,899,901,900,898,883,901,899,879,879,893,896,878,902,191,849,896,893,892,871,894,892,895,878,894,896,895,896,893,874,878,894,893,878,894,894,876,888,891,893,875,893,893,894,895,895,895,894,875,895,899,899,896,897,877,898,899,898,882,882,903,901,883,903,827",Sat 15 Jun 1872,"400,2479,460,515,550,583,643,674,707,764,797,831,890,923,957,1013,1049,1082,1139,1170,1205,1261,1290,1326,1383,1419,1452,1509,1542,1580,1633,1672,1706,1757,1791,1827,1885,1917,1953,2008,2043,2076,2131,2161,2198,2254,2285,2320,2376,2409,2443,2509,2576,2611,2691,2737,2778,2824,2869,2913,2959,3002,3047,3091,3135,3178,3222,3269,3313,3356,3400,3443,3490,3534,3578,3622,3666,3710,3756,3797,3841,3883,3929,3975,4016,4063,4104,4148,4195,4239,4285,4328,4372,4414,4458,4504,4546,4589,4643,4688,4732,4776,4819,4863,4907,4953,4995,5039,5083,5126,5169,5214,5258,5302,5348,5389,5433,5480,5526,5565,5611,5657,5699,5742,5787,5831,5876,5918,5962,6008,6052,6099,6142,6186,6230,6274,6317,6361,6403,6447,6490,6537,6578,6622,6666,6710,6754,6795,6841,6894,6940,6986,7028,7071,7115,7159,7206,7249,7293,7335,7381,7425,7469,7513,7557,7603,7650,7688,7734,7778,7820,7863,7909,7954,8000,8043,8083,8129,8173,8219,8261,8304,8351,8397,8439,8482,8526,8570,8616,8658,8701,8746,8789,8836,8883,8928,8972,9017,9063","5115,5584,4975,5054,5054,5052,5052,5052,5050,5055,5055,5025,5050,5024,5050,5055,5054,5058,5054,5054,5052,5052,5020,5050,5050,5050,5052,5052,5050,5050,5050,5052,5049,5019,5052,5050,5050,5050,5050,5052,5052,5052,5052,5052,5052,5016,5055,5054,5055,5054,5055,4989,4986,4954,4997,4954,4956,4956,4956,4956,4957,4954,4956,4956,4956,4956,4954,4956,4956,4954,4953,4956,4954,4953,4953,4953,4953,4954,4954,4954,4956,4956,4956,4954,4956,4956,4956,4956,4954,4956,4954,4953,4954,4953,4954,4953,4954,4953,4994,4953,4953,4953,4953,4953,4953,4954,4954,4953,4956,4954,4954,4954,4954,4956,4954,4961,4954,4956,4956,4953,4956,4954,4954,4954,4956,4956,4954,4956,4956,4956,4957,4956,4956,4956,4956,4956,4954,4953,4954,4953,4953,4953,4953,4953,4953,4953,4953,4953,4956,4997,4951,4953,4953,4951,4953,4953,4951,4951,4951,4951,4951,4950,4953,4953,4950,4951,4951,4950,4950,4950,4950,4950,4950,4948,4950,4948,4948,4946,4946,4945,4946,4945,4945,4945,4942,4942,4942,4942,4942,4940,4939,4940,4937,4937,4937,4937,4937,4937,4934",27271373,Page 6

WISDOM.
Say what is Wisdom ? Ah 'tis but to know
That all is vanity, or worse, below.
'Tis to be fated with a prophet eye
Without the stength to dare, the power to fly :
O'er past Times' shameful history to brood
Without the hope of better, if as good.
Intending ease to find the body whole
The sickly captive of th' ambitious soul;
Or with an intellectual flight designed.
The brutal body dragging down the mind.
To have a touch so keen — a glance so staid,
Life's seeming substance proves an empty shade.
'Tis while o'er others' meannesses we groan
In self discovering naught that might atone
To read in others' littleness, our own.
To dread that if explored Fate's stormy night-
Rapt in its lightennigs to their farthest flght
Would be to perish in insufferable Light !

. A LEGEND. .. .
There lies -within the China Sea
'An island small-though what may bo
ItB name is quite unknown to me
To which a sailor landing there,
Gave, in return for friendly care,
Some poultry of the common breed;
(A valuable gift Indeed,
You'll say, on hearing that till them
The natives never saw a hen!)
'And thus of eggs they learned to eat;
Boiled eggs were deemed a special treat;
No other mode the people sought
Than boiling-as the sailor taught
God bless him-for the proper way
Of cooking eggs; until, one day,
Some lucky fellow tried the plan
Of cooking in a. frying-pan ;
And with such excellent success
That all who ate, at once confess
The trick worth knowing. By-and-bye
Some innovator chanced to try
If baking eggs might not by chance
The culinary art advance.
The people eat and answered: ""Good!
Baked eggs are most delicious food!""
Invention is contagious; soon
Some cook essayed the stirring spoon,
'And, lo! an omelette appears!
'iWhich all receive with hearty cheers
For him'who, by some god'inspired,
Left nothing more to be desired! . :
At length, some daring artisan
In cookery essayed the plan
Of stewing eggs; whereat he cried
(When, he the precious dish had trièd):
''Eggs with tomatoes stewed are best;
Let all who doubt the truth attest!""
""Good!"" said the people, ""very good;""
'And so thenceforth their eggs were stewed;
Until, one day, a stranger came,
.Who straightway won immortal fame,
The while the miracle he taught
Of eggs cooked a la Huguenot!
But why proceed to tell the tale
Of all the fashions that prevail
Of cooking eggs? How they increased
To half a hundred, at.the-least?
And how the latest, all protest,
Whate'er the mode, was still the best?
These flippant eulogies to.hear,
Offended much a sage's ear,
'And thus he spoke: ""Prate, as ye may;
Call this or that the finest way
Of cooking eggs; but, as for me',
What praise in' cookery may be'
I leave to other tongues and pens;
God bless the man who,brought the hens!""

An Episode of Bush Life.
BY ""DRAMINGO.""
THE hot fierce sun above; below, the river
In glittering sparkles flashing back each ray:
Scarcely a breath to make the tree tops quiver,
Or rustle 'midst their leaves in idle play.
Scarcely a sound to tell that life is teeming
In the dense scrub that lines the winding creek
In drowsy stillness sleeps the forest—dreaming—
Save where a parrot wakes it with a shriek.
A long harsh shriek! like one in anguish dying,
Or eldritch cursing with unholy ban ;
As though the frightened bird had seen there lying
The dead horse, on the living breathing man ;
And, in that startled glance, instinct had told it
The meaning of the tragedy below,
And ere it flew, in pity to behold it,
It cried aloud, in one long wail of woe.
""Is this a dream ? Can I be really here ?
The dead horse lying on my shattered bone;
No chance of life ! No friend, no comrade near !
Nought left but death—a lingering death—alone,
""How many dreadful hours must I await
Death's coming?—for he is my only friend,
Who in his mercy kindly will abate
My sufferings, and console me at the end.
""Will he come quickly? Shall I see him stand
And gaze at me with eyes of solemn greeting?
Then will he stoop, and with an icy hand
Touch my warm heart, and still its weary beating?
""Or, in the evening's shadow-haunted gloom,
When through the trees I hear the night-wind roam,
But as a darker shadow will he loom,
And gently comfort me, and take me home?
""Ah night! dear night! so cool, and calm, and still;
Could I but drink once more, in peace I'd lie
In your dark arms ; let me but have my fill
Of that sweet water ! God, then let me die.
"" In the deep silence I can hear it splash
Amongst the rocky boulders far below.
Oh! could I only reach the side, and dash
My fevered body in its cooling flow!
""Keep back, you fiend! I see you hiding there
Behind that tree-trunk, mocking me in scorn:
Grinning and mowing, with a wicked stare
That could not come save from a thing hell-born.
""You'll go away when the hot day is done,
And the kind night cools me with dewy rain;
But when the east glows red before the sun
You will return, and torture me again;
""Showing me where the sparkling river falls
Over the rocks—so close! O Heaven, and then
Delude me with false answers to my calls
For aid and succour from my fellow-men.
""Give me quick death, if you have mercy, Christ,
And are the God of love, and not of fear!
Why torture me? Surely it had sufficed
To take my life—not leave me lingering here.
""If fiend you are, then work your fiendish will;
Burning me with fierce sun and fiercer thirst:
Crushed, lone, and helpless, I defy you still;
I'll pray no more, but hold you for accursed.
""Ah! do not bind me! Give me water, pray!
And I'll not struggle more, but let the flame
Consume me calmly; only take away
Those haunting eyes—that head, bowed in shame.
""Call no more ghosts; there are enough here now;
If this is hell I cannot now atone
For past misdeeds. O cool my aching brow !
Keep off, you devils ! Let me die alone.
""How balmy feels the air! and the soft sound
Of chiming bells comes on the evening breeze,
So rich with fragrance, from the flower-decked ground
From hawthorn hedges, and from chestnut trees.
""This well-known lane! The old familiar place
Left years ago, but never quite forgot—
This hand in mine! Is it my sister's face?
How little changed! To think I know you not!
""True, I am weak and faint; but we will go
To the old churchyard, and when there we'll stray
Amongst the quiet tombs, and you can show
Me those of friends, lost since I went away.
""Strange! it is falling dark; and where I stand
There seems an open grave. Surely I live!
And yet—I'm blind; and now—how cold your hand!
This must be death ! Have mercy—God—forgive.""",The Queenslander ,"858,518,655,309,669,698,732,640,679,742,770,683,756,839,810,723,767,545,569,606,652,693,768,772,660,672,564,647,754,722,652,803,706,829,588,703,839,706,692,698,646,608,660,834,757,732,677,779,678,720,687,836,712,749,654,655,791,655,640,715,764,721,707,701,735,702,586,782,805,523,702,630,730,721,853,768,765,630,683,764,707,791,700,680,764,839,872,816",Sat 1 May 1880,"331,627,759,843,896,926,959,992,1047,1080,1115,1150,1205,1238,1272,1306,1362,1395,1430,1465,1565,1600,1633,1666,1723,1756,1789,1824,1880,1913,1946,1980,2036,2069,2104,2139,2206,2239,2274,2307,2362,2398,2430,2463,2565,2598,2633,2666,2723,2757,2789,2824,2880,2915,2948,2983,3050,3085,3117,3151,3217,3252,3282,3320,3387,3422,3457,3488,3557,3591,3625,3654,3759,3794,3828,3861,3917,3951,3984,4020,4074,4107,4142,4175,4230,4263,4296,4329","202,362,296,469,205,239,205,238,206,239,203,236,198,238,198,233,200,239,203,239,203,236,202,238,206,241,203,241,205,241,206,241,219,243,206,239,206,239,205,239,206,244,209,243,206,241,205,239,208,239,206,241,208,243,206,241,209,241,206,241,211,244,208,243,213,244,211,244,211,244,213,244,211,244,208,243,208,241,206,241,206,238,205,239,206,239,206,239",20332722,Page 553

SUGGESTED BY CERTAIN DISGUSTING ATTACKS
UPON PRIVATE CHARACTER, CONTAINED IN A
SCANDALOUS AND OBSCENE PERIODICAL.
Curs'd be the wretch (to man a living shame)
Who casts his venon o'er his neighbour's fame
Who, snake-like, lies in ambush on the ground,
And who delights the virtuous breast to wound.
Whose business seems, from covert dark to fire,
And wound the worth to which he can't aspire.
The MAN of honest worth and noble heart,
Receives, unhurt, the demon's hellish dart.
Not so the gentler sex: if liars assail
THEIR spotless fame (though ne'er can they pre
vail),
Yet, though that fame survive unhurt the blast,
The HEART accutely feels the shock that's past.
Let, then, the wretch droop low his guilty head,
Despised, abhorred, to manly feeling dead;
Nor ever more allow his filthy pen -.
To raise the scorn of honest upright men.

""The schoolmaster Is abroad.""
Brougham.
IN the Cornwall Chronicle of the 3rd instant,
there appears an advertisement, headed "" homo
genious dinner."" The writer was evidently in
want of a pompous adjective, and like Mrs. Mal
aprop, has made use of a most heterogenious one.
Query-What sort of a dinner Is really meant?
Querist.
THE BUSHRANGERS.-We announced in our
last that Jeffs' and Conway had been captured.
The party, headed by Mr. Thomas Connell, had
explored the ground in the neighbourhood with
out success, and the constable had intimated to
the Campbell Town police magistrate that the
bushraigers were not then there.- Having heard
nothing of their movements since the 17th ultimo,
Mr. Stuart ordered that the party should continue
on the same field, until positive intelligence of the
appearance of Jeff's and his companion at some
other point should be made known. But on Fri
day last, as the constables were approaching a hut
on the South Esk, occupied by Mr. Youl's shep
herd, both the bushrangers rushed from the dwell
ing, and endeavoured to elude the party by dog
ing behind trees. Jeffs, we believe, threw down
his gun, but afterwards resumed it. - However,
upon being repeatedly summoned to surrender,
and seeing escape impossible, they both cast away
their weapons, and held up their hands in token
of submission. It is gratifying to learn that these
men have been apprehended without farther blood
shed. The hut-keeper and another free man
found in the hut, were arrested on the suspicion
of harbouring Jeffs and Conway, and are now in
custody at Campbell Town. .
ROBERY.-A most impudent but successful
robbery was committed on Saturday night. A
large iron safe, belonging to Mr. Rocher, was re
moved from its place adjoining his bedroom, and
forcibly broken open. The considerate thieves
did not disturb the documents to them of
no value, but of the greatest importance to
Mr. Rocher- but they walked off with all the
cash the safe contained. The thieves must have
been well acquainted with the locality, and adepts
at their profession.
THE LATE RAINS.-There is nothing which
contributes so much to the health of the inhabit
ants of a town as a thorough and proper system
drainage. Hence the recent extensive enquiries
made by order of the imperial parliament, as to
the sanitory statistics of the different towns and
cities at home. It has been found that some
towns, situated in elevated localities, and gene
rally considered in healthy districts, but where
the duties of the public scavenger and proper
ventilation were neglected, have been the most rife
with those diseases and fevers which malaria
makes our poor flesh heir to: and, on the other
hand, where the site was low, and consequently
strongly suspected of being unhealthy, was found
the reverse-from the very circumstance of its
situation causing precautions against those natural
evils which were so apparent. Of this latter class
is Launceston. It is low, and confined by hills
on all sides, except when the river displays its
banks of mud flats, with the extensive swamps
beside it after such a rainy winter as was the last.
The summer told a fearful tale of death, from
dysentry, fevers, and other similar causes; while
the miasmata from the stagnant pools and un
drained portion of our streets ascended unchecked
and unheeded, We believe Sir John Franklin
made some particular enquiries on this head,
while here lately ; and we trust that there is truth
in the report that since the last heavy rains the
Town Surveyor has turned his attention to this
point, as he is in expectation of orders to carry
out an efficient system of good and thorough
drainage. From the favourable site of the town,
having a complete fall to Margaret-street, its
lowest level, and the velocity with which, in wet
weather, the water runs off from the streets
around the Windmill-hill-a course of subdivided
surface drains, which would be quickly dry and
easily repaired in case of accidental damage-it
might be easily accomplished. We trust the at
tention of the authorities to so essential a point
will be instant and energetic.-Communicated.
DR. LANG--Thls highly talented, bold, ener
getic, but eccentric individual has arrived at
Port Phillip per ""Sea Horse,"" via Launceston,
for the purpose of personally canvassing the elec
tors of that district. While at Launceston he
published in the Examiner an address to the pres
byterians of that town. We regret to see that the
Examiner, the agent of the Doctor's own paper,
the Observer, permitted the insertion in its co
lumns of a very violent attack upon the Doctor.
Its object may be very good, but that the Exami
ner should be the vehicle of its appearance, was
not in the best taste. This journal differs very
essentially from Dr. Lang on many subjects po
litical and religious, but so long as we act as the
agent of a newspaper, personal assailers of him
must go elsewhere. We shall insert the most Im
portant passages of his Launceston address in our
next number.-Murray's Review.
SYDNEY-AUSTRALIAN BANK.-A typogra
phical error occurred in a short paragraph under
the above head, in our last number. It was stated
that the directors of the Bank of Australasia were
to discontinue business. It is the local Bank of
Australia which is about to wind up its affairs;
and respecting which so much animadversion has
appeared in the public prints. The Bank of Aus
tralasia is a very different establishment. It is an
English bank, and has branches at Hobart Town
and Launceston, in this colony; Port Phillip,
and South Australia. The similarity of the names
is apt to induce mistake, and we therefore take
the opportunity to state that the Bank of Austra
lia is a Sydney local bank, while the Bank of Aus
tralasia exists in all the important towns in the
Australasian settlements.
MECHANICS' INSTITUTE.-WE understand that
the Rev. Mr. West has postponed his lecture, and
allowed Dr. Udny to occupy the night advertised,
so that the Mechanics' Institute and teetotal lec
tures may not clash. There will, therefore, be no
lecture to-morrow night at the Mechanics' Insti
tute.
TEETOTAL SOCIETY.-A lecture will be de
livered by Mr. Nichols, at the Infant School-room,
to-morrow evening.
FENTON'S FORD.-On Saturday two persons
attempting to cross at this place in a chaise-cart
narrowly escaped drowning, and were indebted
for their lives to the servant of the police magis
trate, who was accidentally there at the time. The
horse was lost, but the cart will be recovered. It
is rather remarkable that the man and woman
who were rescued from a watery grave were, with
two other men, apprehended on Sunday morning
by that active gentleman, Mr. Hortle, for the
robbery of a house in Longford. The parties are
committed for further examination.
PORTLAND BAY.-An absurd affair of honour,
as it is called, took place on the beach at this set
tlement, and.hns been duly chronicled in the pub
lic prints. The parties immediately concerned,
were Dr. Corney and the postmaster; and they
were determined to prove by fighting which was
the gentleman, as the one had denied the propri
ety of this appellation to the other. The seconds
with commendable humanity, furnished the belli
gerents with pistols loaded with powder and
paper: the duel was not attended with fatal con
sequences to any one.
THE WATER CONTRACT.-Mr, Wakefield has
very properly taken occasion of the refusal of
government to ratify the contract with Captains
Cheyne and Swanston, to direct public attention
to the subject. Want of space precludes us from
noticing the matter at greater length this number,
but we will have a few suggestions to offer in our
next.
PORTLAND.-This place is fast rising in impor
tance, and it is happily free from that distress
which so fearfully affects the other settlements.
Speculation in land has there been yet almost
unknown, and a superficial show of prosperity
has not deceived those connected with the place.
We are Informed that the imports last year did
not exceed £22,000, while the exports during the
same period, are estimated at £40,000. Including
202 bales of wool from Port Fairy, about 2050
bales were shipped from Portland.
THE following was Sir George Arthur's opinlon
of the colony, expressed in one of his despatches
in June 1832, and was given to the public in the
last Review:-"" A young colony, and especially
one based upon a convict population, is always
liable to great and sudden changes. There is no
substantial, solid, capital accumulated to sustain it
against those calamitous events to which every
country is more or less exposed; and until the
stability is acquired, it is impossible to be too
guarded in every act which is to affect the com-
munity; and at least all measures generally un-
popular ought to be avoided, unless they are ab
solutely necessary, and then public opinion will
eventually, when the ferment of the moment has
subsided, support their introduction.""
THE brig Leo, Bell, from Liverpool, arrived
here on Wednesday last, with a general cargo.
This vessel left England on the 3rd January, and
from the evening of that day to the 18th expe
rienced a series of gales and severe weather down
the channel and in the Bay of Biscay. Last Tues.
day week the Leo was struck over the stern by a
sea, which carried away the wheel and part of the
round-house, and threw the helmsman with con-
siderable force against the skylight, severely in-
juring the man's breast and arm. The Leo brings
a few papers, which, not being later than the 31st
December, add but little to our stock of English
intelligence.-Courier.
SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.-The midland bea
gle pack had their first meet on Saturday last, in
the vicinity of York Plains. The day was beau
tiful, and the field well attended; and the sport
was allowed, on all hands, to be exceedingly good
-allowance being made for the pack having been
so recently brought together from various quarters
where they have been dispersed during the sum
mer months. At the conclusion of a successful
chase the gentlemen present, consisting almost ex
clusively of members of the hunt, were hospitably
entertained by John Lord, Esquire.
The first appointed meeting of the Clarendon
hounds took place at Campbell Town on Wednes
day, and was attended by a well mounted field,
and favoured with a fine moist day. A stag was
provided by that liberal patron of the sports of
the field, James Cox, Esq., of Clarendon, and at
eleven o'clock was released from a cart in a judi
cious position contiguous to the township. Unlike
his antlered brother of the last season, he took a
northerly direction for M'Leod's mill, followed
after ten minutes' law (the fairest law that's
known) by the hounds and huntsmen. A short
gallop brought to a check, when it was found the
game had taken the water, and was seen swim
ming majestically up.the Elizabeth river, followed
by several of the foremost hounds. It was thought
prudent, however, by the assemnbled sportsmen to
whip the dogs off and again to give the privilege
of the law, of chase to the fugitive, who repaid
them with an admirable run, being finally taken
in the Wanstead pastures, and secured for a se
cond day's sport, arranged to take place from
Tunbridge Wells, on Wednesday, the 14th inst.
The pack was hunted in his usual. good style by
James Lord, Esq.-Ibid.
THE BUSHRANGERs.-A party of police, led
by a New South Wales native, is busily engaged
in tracking these depredators; and it is confidently
believed, from the encouragement attending the
pursuit, that they will soon be under the safeguard
of Mr. Capon. At the stock-run of Mr. Austin,
in the vicinity of Lake Echo, they had the teme
rity to slay and dress a fat beast. Here the con-
stables were not far behind them, and soon after
wards, in colonial vernacular, ""sprung a portion
of the plant"" taken from Captain M'Kay. The
horses lately in their possession were found in the
vicinity of Victoria Valley.-lbid.
INTEREST.-We are glad to learn that the Der
went Bank has really reduced the rate of interest
on mortgages due to itself, to 8 per cent. One has
been effected at that rate, and we understand
the measure will become general from the 24th of
June. This, of course, does not affect those
mortgages of which the bank holds the agency for
other parties, but we believe the principal mana
ger, Captain Swanston, has recommended them
to pursue the same course; advice too salutary",Launceston Examiner ,"130,760,726,648,702,704,720,744,728,702,656,654,568,752,78,728,728,747,666,528,640,82,480,165,728,749,756,747,756,720,118,725,760,760,742,760,756,756,752,752,756,760,747,765,747,744,747,760,760,762,760,756,756,756,756,756,756,460,720,756,738,752,756,760,752,756,760,760,663,720,747,760,762,756,760,756,742,756,760,760,756,760,760,756,756,756,756,756,756,752,770,774,770,752,770,770,770,759,770,768,760,760,768,763,765,768,768,760,770,752,765,715,720,770,763,752,760,756,760,768,752,765,750,765,765,752,770,768,756,768,510,720,768,760,765,765,765,770,765,765,760,770,768,765,756,748,765,388,732,765,768,752,765,756,72,720,768,302,730,765,762,750,765,760,760,765,770,768,765,544,732,756,752,768,768,768,756,765,756,770,756,336,735,776,770,763,765,768,770,79,714,756,756,752,756,752,747,760,756,756,530,721,756,759,756,752,756,756,756,756,756,750,752,738,756,752,576,714,752,756,740,756,750,748,750,749,756,756,750,756,342,708,750,738,756,747,752,756,744,752,742,752,550,714,744,747,750,756,747,740,756,750,750,752,752,750,747,750,747,756,750,750,752,738,752,749,750,381,714,738,744,744,747,747,730,726,738,749,744,747,520,704,747,748,744,747,752,747,736,750,744",Wed 7 Jun 1843,"927,984,1025,1069,1108,1149,1193,1234,1275,1318,1360,1402,1444,1486,1538,1570,1612,1653,1695,1737,1780,1822,1900,1943,1984,2025,2069,2109,2152,2194,2238,2313,2356,2397,2440,2480,2523,2565,2605,2648,2689,2731,2770,2815,2860,2901,2943,2984,3027,3069,3110,3153,3195,3237,3278,3322,3363,3406,3491,3533,3575,3617,3659,3703,3744,3789,3829,3871,3922,3991,4030,4078,4117,4158,4201,4242,4284,4324,4370,4410,4451,4493,4536,4576,4618,4662,4700,4742,4783,4827,438,479,521,564,607,649,691,731,773,813,857,904,942,982,1024,1067,1109,1152,1194,1235,1280,1318,1386,1428,1471,1513,1553,1598,1638,1682,1723,1765,1806,1848,1890,1933,1976,2020,2060,2100,2146,2211,2254,2295,2337,2379,2422,2460,2507,2549,2586,2629,2674,2716,2759,2800,2839,2885,2948,2993,3036,3079,3121,3163,3208,3280,3321,3366,3440,3485,3525,3566,3611,3652,3696,3737,3778,3820,3863,3904,3993,4034,4076,4117,4159,4200,4243,4285,4326,4367,4411,4456,4528,4574,4611,4655,4695,4739,4780,4834,435,477,519,561,611,647,687,730,773,812,854,929,974,1014,1056,1099,1142,1189,1230,1267,1308,1349,1392,1434,1481,1519,1562,1643,1685,1727,1768,1817,1854,1896,1945,1985,2022,2064,2106,2149,2191,2267,2310,2352,2394,2438,2480,2521,2562,2604,2649,2692,2725,2773,2815,2857,2898,2942,2982,3028,3068,3110,3152,3195,3237,3278,3319,3359,3404,3442,3488,3530,3574,3615,3657,3700,3741,3783,3871,3913,3956,3997,4041,4082,4124,4165,4206,4249,4289,4333,4377,4439,4482,4519,4565,4607,4649,4683,4736,4773,4821","1376,1060,1096,1095,1061,1062,1063,1062,1063,1061,1060,1060,1060,1058,1130,1059,1058,1058,1058,1059,1057,1703,1200,1621,1094,1061,1059,1060,1060,1060,1062,1094,1060,1061,1063,1063,1066,1066,1066,1066,1063,1061,1060,1060,1061,1061,1061,1061,1061,1061,1061,1062,1061,1062,1063,1064,1065,1066,1104,1068,1067,1067,1066,1065,1065,1063,1062,1062,1059,1094,1058,1058,1059,1060,1059,1059,1060,1060,1060,1059,1059,1060,1059,1058,1058,1057,1057,1057,1055,1057,1843,1841,1843,1844,1845,1846,1848,1848,1849,1850,1850,1854,1852,1853,1852,1853,1853,1855,1855,1854,1855,1854,1889,1853,1854,1852,1853,1855,1855,1856,1854,1854,1853,1852,1854,1853,1853,1854,1854,1853,1853,1888,1852,1852,1854,1855,1854,1853,1853,1855,1856,1854,1854,1855,1855,1854,1855,1853,1891,1855,1854,1854,1855,1854,1854,1889,1853,1854,1890,1855,1856,1856,1856,1855,1856,1856,1855,1855,1854,1853,1890,1853,1853,1852,1853,1851,1852,1852,1852,1851,1851,1851,1886,1852,1850,1851,1849,1849,1849,1848,2694,2650,2649,2650,2650,2650,2649,2649,2649,2650,2651,2687,2652,2652,2653,2652,2654,2654,2654,2654,2654,2654,2654,2655,2654,2654,2654,2691,2656,2654,2655,2654,2655,2655,2655,2655,2654,2648,2655,2654,2653,2690,2653,2654,2654,2655,2654,2655,2655,2655,2655,2655,2656,2691,2656,2656,2656,2656,2657,2657,2656,2656,2656,2656,2656,2655,2655,2656,2656,2655,2655,2655,2656,2656,2656,2655,2655,2655,2690,2656,2656,2657,2655,2655,2656,2656,2654,2654,2654,2654,2654,2689,2654,2653,2654,2653,2653,2653,2653,2653,2654",36233744,Page 4

When you arrive at Sydney, sailing up
The harbour, a small central isle you'll see,
With two or three low huts-but not a tree,
Nor blade of gro?s-upon't ; and, on the top,
A score of men In coarse habiliments,
Hewing the rock away. You may romember,
Among the many evil-traced events
Of a town life, some robbery, when December
lrought on the long, dark nights-a neighbour's boy
Tried for't, and banished. Ile, perchance, is olne
Who yonder lills the pickalxe in the sun,
To level Pittcintgt Island! If e'er joy
Gllulden'd your helart on Englatnd's shore, oh never
Forget that Englishmen are banished here for ever.

John Chinaman, my Joe John,
I wonder what you'll say,
When you find that you're compelled
Ten golden pounds to pay;
Ten pounds per head to pay, John,
A tax on young and old,
Before you have the privilege
Of digging up our gold.
John Chinaman, my Joe, John,

To test her hidden treasures, John,
She welcomed every man;
And you among them all, John,
To come here were not slow
With your cradles and your bamboo canes,
John Chinaman, my Joe.
John Chinaman, my Joe, John,
It was a brave conceit
To let all poor adventurers
Upon our gold-fields meet;
Though some folks thought it odd, John,
We did not deem it so,
But let all nations share alike,
John Chinaman, my Joe.
But soon we found, John Chinaman,
You were not like the rest,
For thousands of your countrymen
Upon us quickly pressed;
To put a stop to this, John,
And keep you within bounds,
The Act has now been passed, John,
To make you pay ten pounds.
John Chinaman, John Chinaman,
Oh! When we knew you first
We did not think for gold, John,
You'd show such mighty thirst;
But nothing keeps you back, John,
Each vessel that arrives,
Brings several hundred Chinamen,
And all without their wives!
John Chinaman, my Joe, John,
It seems quite clear to me,
The myriads that keep coming, John,
From your dear land of tea,
Would very soon quite swamp us,
And that would never do;
You'd better stay at home, John,
Or bring your sweethearts too.",Empire ,"809,411,498,494,452,684,320,402,630,420,408,500,358,422,378,597,340,585,342,357,566,721,543,604,360,492,359,469,348,536,396,514,395,456,487,430,427,471,330,477,673,413,365,508,611,627,580,647,642",Mon 21 Jun 1858,"888,930,954,980,1004,1028,1053,1076,1102,1137,1163,1187,1212,1235,1261,1284,1310,1345,1372,1395,1421,1443,1470,1492,1519,1553,1580,1603,1629,1652,1679,1702,1728,1763,1788,1813,1838,1862,1887,1910,1936,1958,1985,2008,2034,2057,2084,2106,2132","4059,4228,4256,4231,4256,4228,4256,4229,4256,4229,4254,4226,4255,4226,4253,4228,4252,4054,4261,4225,4053,4054,4013,4026,4250,4223,4253,4225,4254,4053,4252,4199,4251,4224,4251,4229,4251,4222,4251,4224,4251,4228,4251,4224,4013,4049,4023,4020,4023",60429707,Page 4

A WRECK AT SEA. ;
(By Amy Hogue.)
The shrieking wind had lulled àt last,
The clear bright air was scarcely, chill,
And after that ono awful blast,
The cruel waves were cairn ""and still.
Above the wide now cheerful sky,
Where blue succeeded black and grey;
Where rose one earnest mother's cry,
As grim night lightened into day.
Below the brilliant placid sea,
"" So lately tossed by angry storm;
Below-all round-tranquility,
On waves the .sun was turning warm.
The captain's wife was up on deck,
To see the first faint streak of dawn ;
A child's warm, hands had clasped her neck;
A child's kies pressed a face grown worn.
The sun rose higher in the sky;
The sea flashed beautiful and bright;
But lower sank the ship to die,
Away from all that glorious light.
Down, down, why looked the world so fadr.
So beautiful-so full of light?
When they must go far, far down there.
To darkness, cokl, and black os night.
Strong men with brown hand clasped in hand.
Think of a sweetheart, child, or wife;
Lcok at the trio as they stand,
Together to the last in life.
The child lies on the mother's breast,
Sleeping with tranquil, sweet-drawn breath;
Perhaps, unconscious, that brief rest
Might deepen to the sleep of Death.
Down, lower yet; then one swift rush .
Startles the water into waves; .
Waves that all seem to murmur ""Hush!""
A requiem o'er so many graves.
'Tis over now; the waves grow wide, v
Whispering still so mournfully;
Mourning for those brave souls that died

Who has hacked off a hunch of my cheese !
Your oat, Mrs. Pratt, is a wonderful oat,
But his wonderful ways do not please.
None know better than I that he'll make butterfly,

Broad goes slice after slice-cribbed perhaps by the

Though of that I by no means feel sure.

I wish that I could, for then, ma'am, I should
Take nine of his lives, at the least ;
I always seem out when he's prowling about
With intent on my victuals to feast.

A NEW ORANGE SONG.
For the Argus.
When treason rais'd her bloody hand
And spread rebellion through the land,
A noble and devoted band
Of Orangemen alone,
Ready to enter on her wars,
And to protect their country's cause,
And to support her glorious laws,
Her Altars and the Throne.
In numbers near a million strong,
A noble and a gallant throng,
Whose deeds in story and in song,
Have of't pass'd in review,
With swelling heart and glancing eye,
They rais'd their banner to the sky—
See it now floating proud and high,
The Orange and the Blue.
Can Erin be in danger then,
While she can find a million men,
Collect on mountain, moor, and glen,
And ready to defend her.
When every man will do or die,
And when were any known to fly,
Who use the famous battle cry,
The gallant ""no surrender.""

Among the writers in prose and poetry .who
haye'ever' been faithful to: the popular cause in
the present century, Charles Mackay must always
be accorded a prominent place. Although not
brought before the public by his writings quite
as much as heretofore, he is still held in kindly
remembrance by those who have not forgotten the
t good work which he did with his pen. . Born in
Perth'(Scotland) in 1814, and descended from the
Highland family of which Lord Eeay is chief
he moved in his infancy to London, where he re
ceived much of his education. Proceeding to
Belgium to complete his studies, he was a witness
of the startling events of the revolution whioh
broke out in 1830 ; and he published in 1834 a
small volume of poems, which led to his introduc
tion to the late Mr. John Black, then editor of the
London MORNING CHRONICLE, through whom he
became connected with that paper 5 and he con
tinued to be so for about nine years, during which
period he brought out another volume, entitled,
"" The Hope of the World,"" and other poems. -He
became editor of the Glasgow ARGUS in 1844, and
retired from that paper three years later, in con
sequence of a schism in the Liberal party. In
1846 the University of Glasgow conferred on him
the title of LL.D. Upon the establishment of the
London DAILY NEWS, under the editorship
of the late Charles Dickens, Dr. Mackay
wrote for that. journal a series of poems
entitled, "" Voices from the Crowd,"" afterward
published in a collected form. He subsequently
produced many other poetical effusions; among
them being the universally popular songs,
"" Cheer, Boys, Cheer,"" "" To the West,"" "" They
Aro Coming with the Flowers,"" and""many others
which the famous singer, Henry Bussell, rendered
so long to the delight of thousands, and his own
profit, as some of us remember yet. , For some
years he contributed leading articles .to the
ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS 5 and he established
in 1860 the LONDON REVIEW. His best known
prose work is "" Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular
Delusions,"" first published in Í841 ; and he has
contributed articles to many of the principal
English magazines. As a traveller he has visited
the United States, and written the inevitable
book in consequence. This was in 1857-58 ; and
in 1862 he returned to the States, where he re
mained, residing in New York as correspondent
of the London TIMES during the civil war, return
ing to England in 1866. His later works haye
been greatly of an etymological character, in
which he has brought conspicuously forward the
obligations of the English tongue to Celtic
sources.
In th© winter bf his life he has fallen on evil
days, and his friends are seeking to make matters
easier for him. To this end public subscriptions
have been originated. The Governors of New
South Wales and Victoria have given valuable dona
tions, as have many others, who hope to make the
declining days of the ""British Bcranger,"" as Doug
las J errold called him, pass calmly and comfortably.
And, if any man deserves that these efforts should
be made on his behalf, Charles Mackay does.
Throughout his long career-he is now 73 years
of age-he has been an earnest and consistent
advocate of every measure which had for its
object the physical, social, and intellectual
elevation of the people. He was one of the most
active pioneers in the cause of popular
education j and his- powerful letters to
Lord Morpeth (published in 1846) exercised
an important influence in preparing for
the legislation which has since been fol
lowed, and which he clearly foreshadowed.
His labors in this direction were highly appre
ciated by the late Prince Consort, who instigated
the reprinting and circulating of "" The Souls of
the Children,"" which had no small effect in stimu
lating public opinion. His efforts in the great
cause of temperance were equally zealous, and
have been generally acknowledged.
Subscriptions to the ""Charles Mackay"" fund
will be thankfully received by the Eev. George
Walters, "" Tara,"" Stanmore-road, Sydney (rastor
of the Unitarian Church, Liverpool-street.
Sydney), who contemplates giving a concert
lecture on Charles Mackay, with readings and
songs from his works. It is earnestly hoped that
there will be a generous response to this appeal
on behalf of a writer who over forty years ago
foresaw the greatness of Australia, as may be
seen in his poem printed above.",Australian Town and Country Journal ,"880,1009,1046,1046,1047,970,926,965,967,925,963,926,966,958,967,926,966,928,967,598,926,969,603,916,869,968,925,967,923,963,963,922,962,922,980,993,1015,556,963,941,1023,959,917,956,915,955,913,984,925,954,913,779,630,935,954,764,953,427,697,710,521,1007,1052,1052,1052,1051,1051,1051,1114,1051,1039,1034,1050,1049,1051,1057,1033,1051,1049,1036,1051,1050,1050,1050,1034,1049,1047,1051,1049,1050,1049,1050,1050,1050,1047,1048,1045,1047,1047,1049,1049,1047,1049,1051,1047,1052,1051,1052,1051,1036,1053,1038,1055,1053,1055,1056,164,1009,1055,1055,1055,1038,1054,1039,1053,1053,1052,1054,1055,1054,1051,1054,1055,1052,1052,1054,1039,1053,1038,1055,1056,1041,1057,1056,748,1006,1054,1054,1053,1036,1054,1053,1054,1054,1053,668",Sat 23 Mar 1889,"3194,3281,3322,3356,3398,3442,3496,3537,3577,3612,3658,3699,3740,3780,3820,3861,3925,3966,4005,4048,4088,4122,4170,4210,4251,4290,4330,4387,4433,4474,4515,4555,4596,4632,4673,4714,4758,4799,4852,4898,4943,4984,5022,5064,5106,5144,5185,5226,5267,5342,5380,5422,5463,5503,5542,5584,5624,5665,5705,5745,5787,5825,5869,5915,5959,6002,6051,6096,6140,6181,6229,6272,6320,6363,6408,6452,6499,354,400,445,490,538,582,626,673,719,763,806,852,897,944,988,1033,1077,1123,1169,1213,1259,1305,1349,1395,1440,1484,1532,1575,1622,1666,1712,1756,1802,1848,1892,1937,1983,2029,2073,2129,2166,2210,2256,2301,2346,2392,2437,2483,2528,2574,2618,2664,2710,2755,2801,2847,2891,2936,2983,3028,3073,3119,3164,3209,3255,3300,3346,3390,3432,3481,3526,3573,3617,3663,3708,3754,3799,3843,3890","487,357,318,319,318,395,438,396,393,435,396,434,393,401,393,434,394,432,392,391,433,389,433,392,433,390,433,390,434,391,391,432,392,432,373,361,339,431,389,410,327,391,433,393,433,391,432,362,420,389,430,392,387,408,389,376,389,431,391,431,818,354,308,308,309,308,309,308,245,309,310,310,311,312,311,306,312,1408,1409,1408,1408,1407,1409,1410,1409,1410,1411,1407,1410,1409,1409,1410,1409,1409,1411,1411,1413,1412,1411,1410,1410,1412,1411,1409,1411,1409,1410,1408,1409,1409,1407,1406,1405,1406,1404,1404,1404,1451,1404,1403,1403,1406,1403,1403,1403,1405,1403,1403,1403,1403,1404,1403,1403,1404,1403,1402,1402,1400,1401,1400,1399,1400,1399,1400,1398,1447,1398,1399,1398,1401,1398,1399,1398,1399,1399,1399",71116727,Page 29

unsurpassed by any in the Englhsh language.
In council when young IRace appear'd,
Fresh from the string where he was rear'd,
His friends and felluw.councillors sneer'd
At the Yahoo of Launceston I
He smil'd, and such a ghastly smile
Such as sea-sickness wears awhile,
And quite as vulgar as his tile
And bird's*eye sky.blue neckerchief.
As soon as he the book had kiss'd
lie spoke n hot ho litonilst :
Sthen clenchi'd an ? hoo k angry fist,
And charg'd with all his orat'ry.
Ills speech (and he did nobly stammer)
Was independent of all - grammar;
And full an hour Yahoo did hammer
To death poor Lindley Murray.
'Gainst nouns and verbs he drew his sword,
And adjectives and adverbs gor'd,
'Till every member present roar'd
To hear the castigation i
And trasnsportation he maintain'd,
Tho' by some would-be-patriots brain'd,
By it alone there could be gain'd
A virtuous population I
And when the ill-bred dlogs were tax'd
His heart congenially relax'd,
As with a gracious smile he 'ax'd'
' If dogs e'er brought forth puppies ?'
Talk not of this isle's ruin, see
The vessels near the battery
Freighted with England's felonry:
All hail Lord Grey's isopathy I
Now, as for thistles, why, his votes
Should go with Leake to import goats
And donkeys, but he'd take his notes.
And bray next term vocif'rously I
And when, grown old and grey with toil,
He had wound up this mortal coil,
Perchance a credit to the soil,
Had lie but stuck to orat'ry !
But ah I he op'ed a paper war
About rebellion on this shore,
When Retribution kill'd him for
The death of poor old Murray I
Poor Race, thy race was sadly run,
1Hy vanity and ignorance done,
And not a wreath of laurel won

Pours her silver flood along ;
And where ten hundred throats, I ween,
Break forth in melody of song.
Sweet are those dells, with tinkling rills/
Where blue-bells bathe in crystal spray,
And pinks retreat in mossy cells,
And throw perfume by stealth away.
Rich are thoso meads, with choicest flowers,
By Nature's hand so lavish Bpread.
A softer bloom bedecks the bowers,
And cowslips blossom in the shade.

By murm'ring brooks, or walk the vale,
The heath her purple dyes display,
And throws a fragrance on the gale.

mash fine ; add four eggs, one cup of sugar, and a
small piece of butter; season with cinnamon and
nutmeg. Bake until brown, and serve hot.
USE THE CRUSTS.-Instead of wasting all the crusts
left at table, it is better to colleot them, and put
them aside into a large earthenware pan, for puddings
and raspings. To make an economical bread pud-
ding, tako about 3oz of the crusts and soak them
well in a bowl of cold water. Strain off the water
whon they are quiet soft, have ready a quart of skim
milk, half a pound of sultanas and two eggs. Beat
up the eggs and add thom to the milk; pour
all over the soaked crusts, adding the sul-
tanas, two dessertspoonfuls of moist sugar,
and a pinch of nutmeg. Bake for about half
an hour, till well risen, after mixing thoroughly.
ThiB makes a most excellont pudding, and one which
ia as good cold as hot. Whon the orusts have accu-
mulated largely, and are very hard, put them on to a
baking tin, and bake in a hot oven for 20 minutes or
half an hour till quito brown, but not burnt. Put
thom on to a piece of newspaper on the kitchen tahlo
and roll them backwards and forwards with the roll-
ing pin till they are reduced to fine raspings. These
are most useful for frying fish and cutlots, for dredg-
ing over scalloped fish and mince, and for macaroni
cheese. The raspings should be kept in a tin or a

TO INA.
Fond memory still recalls the hours
We sweetly passed together,
When round my brow you twined those flowers
Which bloom in every weather.
Of love and hope, and all those blisses
Which, though they linger, never cloy -
Oh ! would I had again those kisses
Which brought me never-failing joy.
I miss thine eye for ever speaking
Language to mine ears unheard,
But which my spirit without seeking
Comprehended without word.
I miss thy form so vine-like clinging,
As if I were thy parent tree,
And thy voice, for ever ringing
In mine ears so merrily.
I miss thy thousand nameless graces.
Shedding o'er me such delight,
That I wish in those embraces
I could pass my life-long night !

Usher, succeeded St. Patric in the see of Armagh, died in a mo-
nastery, founded by him at Carlingford, A.D. 486; the Slieve (that
is, mountain), doubtless had its name in memory of him, as Slieve
Donnard (an immense cone, highest of the Mourne mountains,
north-east of the bay) is so called, from a pious anchorite, who
built a tower near the top. St. Donnard's chapel is still visited as a place of pilgrimage.
+ This Pass, on the borders of Argoil, a frontier county of the
Pale was the scene of many hot and bloody conflicts. Moryson
tells that the ""Lord Deputy Mountjoy, when in Newry, on his
way to the Pale, proclaimed a reward of £2000 for the capture of
Oniall, and then marched by the way of Hathorn; but at the
Pass of Carlingford Oniall was on him again and a battle ensued,
where Sir H. Danvers, Mountjoy, and many other officers were severely wounded, and after heavy loss, the English fled to
Dundalk.""
++ Cair-Linn-joird is literally the ""rocky pass by a narrow water.""

** Killbroney was an Abbey renowed for learning and piety in
the earliest age of the Irish Church. Its original founder is said
to be Tarlath, Bishop of Armagh, the son of a pagan prince, of
Mourne. The ruins embrace a considerable space; the walls
are massive and covered with ivy; large trees, also, have sprung
up and grown old in the inner chambers of the sacred edifice.
Within the present century, a wintry storm of snow, followed by
a tempestuous gale, solved a mystery which the tradition of ages
connected with Killbroney; the story was--that a monk had neg-
lected to toll the bell to call the brotherhood to prayers when a
ship in the bay was sinking, and that ""the Abbot put the penance
on him for a thousand years, that in every storm, if the wind
was north, he must arise from his grave to toll a bell."" And it
was true that during many a high wind the solemn tone of a bell
had mingled with the rush of the tempest. Some averred it
sounded from the ground; others had ""heard it come down the
road;"" while those of cooler judgment believed, that if the sound
ever had been heard, it must have been that of a ship's bell,
borne on the echoes of the hills. The simple peasant of the
mountain, or the fishermen of the hamlet, when the wonder was
spoken of, piously invoked a blessing, and silently prayed ""for
all Christian souls perishing at sea."" The so long unseen and
unsearchable cause was, however, left visible to all eyes;
branches of an ash tree, intertwining with the ivy, had penetrated
into crevices of the eastern gable, and when bent down by
weight of snow, had borne away from the top the stone facing of
a secret niche containing the ""Ghost's Bell.""

MY BROTHER ! thou hast wander'd far,

There's one who sees thy upright form,
Thy cheerful voice can feign ;
Nor ever chides thy fancy's flight,

Who sheds for thee the silent tear,

landlady of a hotel in the west of Scotland, who
one Sunday, in church, during divine servioe, fell
a victim to the fascinating and ted uotivo charms
of sleep. She was, however, suddenly awakened
from her somnolent state by the falling of her

but that she was in the home of spirits, and
fancying a smash had taken place, ejaculated
with stentorian voice, "" Ye jade, ye hae broken

"" Yes."" "" Did you examine it oarefully before
you swore in your information that it was the

said O'Connell, as he took up the hat, and began
to examine it oarefully inside. He then spelled
out the name of James, slowly, in this manner—
"" J-a-m-e-s."" "" Now, do you mean to say this

How Jm Wick**'* Hbad Got Bald.—Jim
Wicker was a comical looking fellow, with a
very young face, but by reason of having no
hair, he looked very old. He accounted for bis
baldness after this fashion:—"" You see the hair
always did grow rather scarce 'bout my soalp,
and I was always rubbing one thing or another
to fetch it out, for I was sartiu the roots wasn't
dead, though thar was-, little to be seen above
ground. I'd heard of bears' grease, but couldn't
buy any good ; so I thought I would have the
genuine artiole, and I got old Dun to go out and
kill something for my especial benefit. Dan
told me it was spring, and that the bear was in
bad health, and out of season ; I believed be
was trying to quiz me, and I wouldn't take no
fcr an answer. A short hunt fetched a critter
at bay, and Dan, by a shot in the vitals, saved
the varmint; but the bear was in a bad condition,
and had hardly enough ile in him to keep his
joints from squeaking. However, what he did
have I got and used i and, gentlemen,"" laid Jim,
looking sorrowfully round on the company, "" in
two days, what little hair I had commenced
falling oil, and in a week 1 wan us bald as a gun

To please the rough mob caused all that he said
When he boasted so much how bs worked ot his trade,
At tbs lathe till his fingers were WJiked to the bono,
Woore tbo blood had gushed oat ho held up lo bo

To speak ot himself he was welcome and free -,
But!.never thanksd him for speaking of mo;
To drat me before such a low scrubby crowd
As-his friend and ool'eágue, of whom he weis proud ;.
That no one amongst them was born so obsoure,
So- bumblo in life, so lowly and poor ;
That wo, as a Ministry, rosa from poor mon.
Au honour he felt to acknowledge lo them,
That touched, my pride sorely. I thought what ho
moant' <

Then next comes tho murder,-the worst thing ot all,
Bwauso ho oan't ¿how any murder at all.
With what could his mind at the time hvro been fillod,
To assert, os-ba did, that a man bad bcea killed !
Tho whole country at once to set up in a fl J mo ; '
And now it demands he sholl tell tue man's Bamo.

The fabled witch of olden time
Was scrawny, cross, and old ;
She wore a number seven boot
Most dreadful to behold.
ITeri nose bent down to meet her chin,
Which had an upward turn,
And in their sunken sockets deep
Her eyeballs seem to burn.
Befriending- none except her cat,
In darkness she abode;
And when1 she Wished I to take the air,
A broomstick she bestrode.
The modern witch ls beautiful,
.Mild-tempered, young-, and sweet;
A pair of cunning Oxford ties
Incase her dainty feet.
Her nose is slightly retrousse,
A dimple dents her chin;
Her eyes are limpid, magic pools
Where hearts keep falling in.
Surrounded by a loving throng,
In splendor she abides;
And on the lively boulevard
A wneei sne nettly rides.

And trusts ray wish may not be vain
Good time may come at last

LIAN BUSH.
The jewelled bosom of motlier night
Is bending around the earth;
Her child she lulls to reposo as soft,
As the hour of Eden's birth.
And what is night, but the wing of Him,
Wbo tho heavens nnd earth hath made,
A wing let down to enfold the earth
In its silent starry shade V
I'd rather be where these glorious stars
Aro shining, so great and bright,
Than mix with the mirth of city halls,
AVhere diamonds reflect the light.
Neither jar, nor glare, nor Btunnin^
lu this placo distract tbo breast;
But the forest's primal stillness breathes
Its deep and unbroken rest.
Unbroken,?though strange nocturnal birds (
Their notes capricious raise:
And the shy opossum leaves its tree,
And around my pillow plays:
Unbroken,?although tho kangaroo
Bounds past me to feed and play ;
AU heedless of rifle or boomerang,
He lives, and for me he may:
Unbroken,?although a pulse of air
The gum-leaves stirreth among,
And the flying squirrel's sudden leap,
Awakes the buggcry-goug.""
Thc bushman slept: and tho God besought
Made bis sleep secure and sweet;
Though spear -armed savage stalked near bis
head,
And thc snake glid near his feet.
Ho floated nwny in golden dreams,
And reached the emerald shore;
And clasped tn bis heart the cherished ones,
¦ From whom lie would purt no moro.
Ile saw, by tho batiks of Strool's sweet steam,
A tree-girt mansion rise,
AVhere bright-eyed little onos climb'd his kneo
For the tales of other skies.
Again ns a youth, he lived tho scenes
Of his early golden days j
He saw tbo menning or Jacob's dream,
When lo ! bo woke, with praise !
He awoke ; and morning's golden beam
Through tho treos shone clear and warm,
And squirrel, opossum, nnd kangaroo,

Lucifeb Matches.?At a lecture recently
delivered by Dr. Procter, of York, before tho
York Instituto, tho lecturer gavo tho follow-
ing useful information about lucifer matches :
?MesBrB. Dixon, Newton and Heath have a
stock of timber of tho valuo generally of
from £8000 to £10.000. They produoo yonrly
2,100,000,000 matches, Reokonlng tho length
ol' each match at 2J In, they would exceed tho I
circumference of tho globe. It is estimated
that 12,000 to 15,000 gross of boxes of I
matches aro produced weekly in London
alone Tho yearly consumption of phosphorus [
in this country for the manufaoture ol' ¦
matches is estimated at six tons, which, at
3s. Qtl. per lb., represents £1080. Our daily
Consumption of mutches is considered to be
230,000,000, or moro than eight matches a
day for every individual in tho kingdom.
But the great scat of match-making is in
Austria. For example M. Polia1*, at Vlonna,
and M. Furth, in BcJicmia, consume together |
abou.t twenty tons of phosphorus annually,
and omploy about C0O0 persons. ""This quan-
tity of phosphorus iB sufficient to produce
tbo amazing, number of 44,800,000,000
matches. The cost at which boxes and'
matoheB are mado is. equally startling. Mr.
Furth peUu his ohoapost boxes at ld. per
do^en, oaoli box containing eighty matches.
Harrop, a Prussian, sells his plain boxes at
2d. per 100, and 1400 splints for Jd.; and Do
Majo, of Moravia, sells a caso of fifty hoxos,
each containing 100 lucifsva, for ii.?Building

By E. M. ENGLAND
WHEN we grow old, with all the sullen thunder
That shakes our hearts to-day, be still at last?
Will there be nothing left of faith and wonder.
With fever of these aspirations past?
Will glamour light upon the hills no longer,
And will there be no secret path or stair?
No magic in the rose? no furtive rapture
Of sudden hope, and following despair?
Shall we then sit unmoved by whisperinq waters?
Will music leave no thrumming pulse behind?
And lovely mellow phrases of the poets
Wake not the smallest echo in the mind?
Or will Life rather lead to sheltered doorways?
No more of burning, and of sudden cold?

SA.TTJBDAY, JUNE 1, 1807.
I ALTHOUGH to residents on tbo spot the re-
trospect af a month may not present many
noteworthy features, owing to the gradual
development of events ? and tho familiarity
which thia gradual process causes, yot when
we come to summarise the month's inoidents
: or tho information of readers at a distance,
it is found that there is much to be reoorded.
Our last summary, despatched by the Panama
mail steamer Mataura, was issued on the 1st
of May. Sinoe that time tho objeotioas to
the proposals of the late Postal Conference
whian bad then prevailed amongst certain
interested classes in Viotoria have still further
! diminished. Although the Legislative Coun-
cil, or Upper House, of that colony has re-
oorded its disapproval of the arrangement,
tho Government there has suoceedod in
scouring tho assent bf the Assembly, whioh
body, having the constitutional right of con-
trol over the public purse, must be
considered as ""by far the most influential in
thc matter. A now argument, and one of
very considerable foroe, has been urged with
muoh ability in favour of adhering to the
I compact. It has long been regarded as most
desirable by many persons in Victoria that a
I line of mail steam packets should be estab-
lished between that colony and England, by
way of the Cape of Good Hope. The very
successful ' trips of tho steamship Great
Britain aro held to support tho belief that
long ooean voyages may be still moro suc-
cessful when performed by vessels propelled
by a larger amount of'steam power; and
negotiations are understood to be already on
foot for the purpose of establishing suoh
I a line. Now it is oorreotly maintained that
if a contract were entered into by tho
Viotorian Government for a fortnightly
service by way of Gaile and Suez,'
aa desired by tho Melbourne Chamber
of Oommeroo and others opposed to the
Panama sorrioe, tho realisation of the Cape
of Good Hopo route would become impossible ;
whereas if the three liuos by Panama, Singa-
pore, and Cape Leuwin were adopted, as pro-
posed by tbo Conference, no suoh insurmount-
able difficulties would exist with regard to
the subsequent opening of the Cape of Good
Hope route. This is an argument which is
likely to have mach influence even with those
whose opinions had hitherto been confessedly
swayed by their desire for the exclusive
aggrandisement of Melbourne. It may,
therefore, ba safely assumed that the recom-
mendations of the Postal Conference will be
backed by the gen oral assent ot all the Aus-
tralasian colonies. Tho only objections aB yet
have been raised in Melbourne, and there, as vre
have stated, they are rapidly fading away.
From returns presented to the Conference,
it appeared that the numbers of those whose
geographical position in these oolonies made
the Suez or the Panama route most desirable
wore very niarly equal ; and considering that
all Australasia is interested in making a general
compaot, the point may bo considered as
almost, deoided, so far as. she.is concerned
The assont of tho Now South Wales Legisla-
tura has not yet been obtained ; but the Par-
liament of this colony is now summoned to
meet for . despatch of business on the 2nd of
July, next and although many other subjeots
! of great importance are likely to bo brought
under consideration, that'of tho oeean postal
servioo is suro to be entertained with a duo
regard to tho ¿advantages that must aooruo
from a (general agreement.
His Excellency Ibo Governor has recently,
returned from a tour in tho Southern dis trio te,
whenoe he prooeedod by railway to Mel-
bourne, returning to Sydney by sea. As it is
now known that Sir JOHN YOUNO expeots to
be immodiatoly recalled from this Govern-
ment, his period of service according to ordi-
nary UBDge having expired, and the stato of
his health rendering it desirable that he should
enjoy a change of oliniate, tho publio manifes-
tations of welcome that greeted , him during
his journey wero watohed with muoh interest,
it being considered probable that they might
elicit some political hints with regard to the
future His Exoellonoy, howover, avoided
politioal allusions aa far as possible I but he
made some statements whioh aro of great
value to tho colony, as tonding to provo all
that had been assorted of the fertility of vast
traots of country whioh tho present occupants
desire to rotaln as mere sheepwalks,
under the pretence' that they aro
unfit for anything else. The Governor told
the inhabitants of tho JBordor distrlots that
ho eonsldored a largo portion of tho lauds
alluded tb to bo capable of the highest degree
of productiveness, and'that while the sheep
farmers might e»pect by industry and im-
provement, to produoe wool equal to tho olips
of Saxony and Spain, tho great sueoess that
had attended tho wine producers in that dis
triot led to a hope that they might heroaftcr
rival tho vineyards of France and the Rhine.
Testimony liko this, coming from such a
quartor, forms a sufficient answer to tho
in tores tod statements of tho squatters in that
locality,' who have persistently endeavoured
to make it appear that the lands they occupy
are totally unfit for any othor purposo than
tho grazing of stook, and are so poor and
Barren, even in that respeot, that, although
they have already been oocupiod for very
many years, a still further extension of tho
leases is absolutely necessary in order to
make them profitable Another contradiction
of this solfish misrepresentation is given by tho
rapid growth of tho farming interest in the
same quarter, owing to tho operation of free
seleotion. Attempts havo been made to show
that beoause thc free selectors have clustered
themselves together in groups on tho most
favourable soils, instead of scattering them-
selves far and wide over the oountry, the
prinoiplo of freo seleotion has failed, and tho
selection by the Government of areas for
agricultural occupation would bo tho mest
judicious course. But tho faot alluded to
points directly the other way. It shows that
the free soleotors, instead of pouncing down in
mero wantonness upon all the sqüattagés far
and near, have beenjoaroful to take possosion
only of the land most suitable for their
own purposes, and of whioh they must
naturally be able to form a' sounder
judgment than any Government or
any other porson. This Minister for
.Lands, «rho accompanied the Governor
on bis tour, must have soen sufficient to con-
vince him of this; for, while holding out
hopös to the squatters that their leases would
be extended, he was oautious enough to state,
most emphatically, that no interference would
be allowed with the operation of free seleotion,
as tho law of the land. Tho whole subjeot
will no doubt be brought under review in
Parliament «.ext month, or shortly afterwards
and it will then bo for the Gorernmeat t<
show how the maintenance nmd extession o
free seleotion oun be reooncilad with an indis-
criminate and continuous renewal of the pas-
toral leases.
The birthday of her Majesty the Queer
was celebrated in Sydney on the 24th Ma]
in a manner whioh,-while it denoted the uni-
versal prevalence of loyalty to the institution!
of tho mother country, was utterly free frons
any of that truckling subsorvicnoy wbiot
marks a degenerate people. Probably
not less than twenty-five or thirty thousand
oitizons made holiday on the occasion, anc
distributed themselves over tho numerous
places of recreation in the city and suburbs,
and on the shores of Port Jackson. About
fifteen thousand spectators, in holiday attire,
attended the military spectaolo in the public
domain, where nearly two thousand volunteeri
woro reviewed by the Govornor, who after-
wards held a levee, which was largely
attended. The obaraoter of the last news
from England, received by the Suez mail,
was suoh as to revive and strengthen those
feelings of attachment which found a vent on
this occasion, for tho threatening attitude oi
Prance and Prussia; the,rumours of an
alliance between tho two great northern
powers, and the evident restlessness of Italy
in anticipation of coming events, seemed
to indioate am impending storm, from
which Great Britain may be unable to
keep clear. In suoh an event, il
her causo bo a good one, it is tho ardent wish
of the colonists of Australia that the children
of the same raco may be found side by sido,
and that the two kindred nations whioh have
been tho homes of freedom while military
[ despotism ruled the European and Asiatic
continents, may unite to preserve that freedom
for the rest of the world. While on this
subj cot, it may be mentioned that we have
just received a friendly visit from a repre-
sentative of one of the nations that has
recently arisen from a state of dependency to
the condition of a great power. In our last
summary for Panama, we had occasion to
mention a signal servioè whiotr*had been ren-
dered by a Frenoh ship of war to tho morcan
tilo marine of th'iB oolony, and wo have
now to announce the arrival in
Sydney harbour of the Italian frigate
Magenta, whioh came into port
yostorday morning, and was reoeived with and
exchanged tho customary salutes. The
Magenta is engaged in a. service of peaoe,
having been fitted out for a soiontifio oruiso.
She has already visited Gibraltar, Teneriffe,
tho east coast of South Amorioa, Japan,
China, Singapore, Batavia, and Melbourne:
and, after being dooked at this p rt, she will
proceed to Lima and the west coast of
America, beforo returning to Genoa. She is
of somewhat formidable proportions, but only
carries twenty sixty-eight. pounder guns on
the lower deck. As this is the first timo that
tho flag of an .Italian man-of-war bas over
been displayed in thesq waters, the vossel
will be visited by numerous citizens as soon
as she is thrown open to the publie, espe-
cially, as the commander, Captain AHM ia ON,
seems to have created a most * favourable
Impression in Melbourne by bis oourtesy and
affability.
AB a nucleus for a fature navy here
whenever tho day may como for its full growth
-wo have already a vory olBoient .Naval
Brigade; but, in addition to this, a nautical
training ship has recently beon fitted out and
moored in the harbour, for the reception of
wandering and destitute boys, and their train-
ing in marltime¡exeroisoi. Tho object is a
most laudable one, and has for many years past
had tho earnest advooaoy of this journal j but,
unfortunately, tho means adopted for carrying
it out wero not suoh as could moet with un-
prejudiced approval. During a Parliamentary
recess, anofflftbout giving an opportunity for
any oompJtition, the Governmont entered
into a private arrangement with
a mombor of Parliament, and pur-
chased from him, for a large sum of money,
an old .vossel. built thirty yoarssgo, an 1 whioh
had been found quite unfit to sond to sea.
The strictures that wero justly passod upon
this dubious transaction, and tho oritloi.«ras
bestowed upon tho oonvorsion of this old
hulk into a training ship, havo in sorao
quarters been misrepresented as marking
disapproval'Of tho objoot. But tho oxpoRura
and condemnation of an unauthorised act of
this kind no moro argues any objection to tho
serviao.for which, it wai ostensibly, intended
than a public or political offence can bo
covered by tho cloak ot philanthropy.
Last month wo were able t o announce that
the two brothers CLARICE, whose busbranging
oareor had long kopt a portion of the colony
in terror, had at last been apprehended and
lodged in safe custody. They havesiDoebeon.
oonvioted, and sontenced to suffer death-nob.
fer their orina os, whioh aro almost without
number, but for ono of them, namely, shootiog
a policeman with intent to murder him when-,
they wore arrested. The Supreme Criminal
Court is still engaged in the trial of others/
accused of participation in tho heinous offences
.f these men, and it is hoped that the exam-
ples to he made, and the increased vigilance
of the police, will redeem the oountry from
tho disoredit whioh had been brought upo»
it, owing to its protection having been con-
fided to a constabulary erroneously organised'
upon a military system.
Tho annual commemoration of the Sydney
University took placa on tho 18th May. It
possessed peouliar interest from the foot that
the new Prinoipal and Professor of Classics,.
Dr. BADHAM, who had recently arrived fron*
Enp,land as successor to tho lato Dr. WOOLLEY,
was expected to deliver his inaugural speech
on tho occasion. Ho did so aooordingly, and'
in a manner whioh has met with general
approval, owing to its earnestness and sound
practical sense, and tho unmistakable exhi-
bition of a desire on tho part of a soholar of
the highest attainments to develop the more
familiar and useful purposes of tho institution
as well as to cultivate the more profound
studies. Tho University of Sydney has long
stood in need of a reformer, and it is hope!
that the now Professor will aooept and accom-
plish the task whioh lies beforo him.
At the date of our last summary it had beea
raining for a month, and we regret to say
that t here has been no permanent improve-
ment in the weather ns yet., We have had »
few âne days, and strong indications ot
winter ; but the clouds aro still humid, and
no weather-prophet oan foretell when they will
olenr off. t

"" The littlo word ' Good*bye* is under any oircamsUnoe»

WITH THE HOLE IN THE
IWALL.
Ttíe Grand1 Hotel was very small,
Bu|t still it was a 'Tort of call:""
A' sort of place where ""boys"" could
And have a ""jamboree/"" you know.
The structure was of modest plan,
Thle architect-a Chinaman.
"" ' Eliabethan' too much styleV
Thjp architect said with a simile;
""I makee plenty simple pjlan,
More better* cajll it * Mary-Ann.1 T
No Supervisor ran the show
For George, he was the Chief you
know.
He had1 no liquor licence, and
(Would! riot transgress laws of the Jand.
No ""requisitions"" troubled him,
He'd tapi the wall and call for Jim.
""Some bottled1 beer, quick,"" Georg«
would1 say- »
And Jimmy, brought it straight away.
Of bottled beer Jim had a stock,
Arid never pointed to the clock.
No sly grog), as I said' before,
Was sold here-so the landlord swore.
But still they got the grog, you see,
For Jimmy said ""You savee me,
I^got too plenty been inside;
I makee door 'bout one foot wide:
You pushee money through the door,
I pushee beer back, plenty more.""
And then the ""boys"" ate oyster stew,
And well boiled tripe and onions, (toot
And then they, sat and talked and
smoked,
And often sang-more often joked.
Arid when their ""hoppers"" got too
Ur,y
Thley, càlle'd for Jim, who said ,""All-li°
Arid1 quick the beer came through the
hole,
And quicker back the coins would
roll;
And fhbn more tripe and oyster stew, x
And soon the crowd got ""unco fou.""
The full committee one night sat
To deal with this and settle that.
A balance sheet was brought to light,
The figures, somehow, weren't right.
Although the totals did agree,
The cash was three quid ""out"" you
see."" \ * %
This caused' an argument and noise:
Tihb Chairman said, ""Now, look here,
boys,
I am the Chairman here to-night,
I'm going to say that things are
right;
Your auditors won't pass this sheet
fl've passed1 tift/ent ou$ itíío the street.
I'll pay the three quid in to show
The books are right: and now ypu
know
I've got a shooting iron here
That talks as loud as all your beer,
And if my ruling's set aside
I'll bore a hole through someone's
hide."" '
Th'e Chairman looked ""tremenjousr*
wild,';
_ And1 then the boys were tamje arid
mild,: i j
They said ""hooray/' and then ""hear,
hear-'*
And1 called up Jimmy for more beer.
They had more beer and good tripe,
too,
And1 said the Management would do.""
The tripe was good, the beer was
cheap*
Inspiring harmony and sleep.
Some left for home and others-well,
Some secrets some men never tell.
But they came back again next night
And* thought the Grand Hotel was

Songs of the Bush.
[Some readers who have been kind enough to send
in contributions for this column evidently do not
understand that only bush songs are wanted. The
majority of so-called songs sent in are simply poems,
often of the sender's own composition. While some
of these are worthy of publication, and are therefore
held with a view to future insertion, they can have no
place in this column, which is reserved for songs and
songs only.]
THE STOCKMAN.
Air.—"" Boorooloola.""
I'm a stockman, yes I am;
They call me ""Ugly Sam""—
I'm old and lame, and only got one eye.
In a yard I'm good, of course,
But put me on a horse,
And I'll do what plenty young 'uns will not try.
I can lead them through the gidyea,
Through country rough and ridgy,
I can lose 'em in the very worst of scrub;
I can tide 'em rough or aisy,
With a head-rope I'm a daisy,
And a right down bobby-dazzler at a pub.
You should see me use a whip;
Can't I give the beggars zip,
Make 'em roar and make the echoes ring,
And with a brand—Ah ! well
I'm a perfect blooming swell—
In fact I'm good at any blessed thing.
I'm a star at spoiling hide,
And can't I put on side,
Come the silvertail as if my blood was blue.
Strike me blue or green or red,
I can stand upon my head,
And be then as good as any other two.
I've a notion in my pate,
It is'nt luck, its fate,
For I'm far above the common blessed run,
Oh ! strike me pink, oh! do,
Come, cut me up in two,
For I'm far too jolly good to be in one.

When our world is filled with sunshine,
dearth and trouble far away,
When life's path is strewn with flowers,
and the heart is glad and gay;
Many an outstretched hand will greet
us;
Many an eye to ours may smile,
Not until our days are darkened shall
we know the ones worth while!
Friends of rank, and wit, and fortune,
haply sorrow shall betray;
Poorer mates, with hearts more honest,
stand before them in that day.
God of life ! If there's one treasure I

When the gloom-clouds thicken o'er me,
give me friends, and grant me
love 1

well to be a friend.

The Shepherd's Last Sleep.
CHRISTOPHUS.
IN the old log hut the shepherd lay,
His fevered cheek by the hot wind fanned;
And he dreamt of the dear ones far away,
And the fields and the flowers of his native land.
And o'er his face crept a tender smile
As he dreamt of one who was dearer still,
And the old home in his native isle.
Ah! if dreams could only their vows fulfil !
To the old log hut by the lonely creek
With naked sword came the Angel of Death;
Pale grew the sleeper's hectic cheek
As no felt the touch of that icy breath.
In the lonely bush in a far-off land,
Where the wattles bloom and the brigalows
wave,
Laid to his rest by a stranger's hand,
The exile sleeps in his nameless grave.",The Queenslander ,"865,491,717,258,640,783,753,866,682,757,647,784,682,826,658,703,633,869,107,668,768",Sat 18 Apr 1885,"361,655,775,1509,855,882,918,950,1013,1041,1076,1109,1164,1197,1231,1266,1321,1356,1398,1422,1457","268,460,335,857,252,280,252,282,247,282,247,282,247,282,249,280,246,279,348,246,214",19797557,Page 609

New South Wales.
I'VE seen thee from the mountains, from the sea,
The harbour and the Academic tower :
I've seen thee at the summer's waking hour,
And on a winter's eve. Thou mindest me
Of clashing rocks of Greek mythology,
Through which, to win her golden, fleecy dower,
The Argo passed to Queen Medea's bower ;
Or of a giant of German legendry
Guarding the gate of an enchanted land.
And ne'er Teutonic ingenuity
Fabled a scene more fairylike or grand
Than that which in thy watch and ward doth lie,
With glassy coves girt to the edge with trees,
And palaces brooding on ship-lined quays.
I went one morn to stand upon thy brows,
One morn in spring ; and climbing the hill side,
Trampled a carpet, marvellously dyed,
Of spring flowers-native violet, native rose,
And heath of almost every hue that grows,
From the pink-tinged epacris of our pride
Down to the white-bloomed dwarf which chill defied^
Before the wattle breaks the spring's trance blows.' I
I climbed until I came to a wet moor |
Whereon the breath of the Pacific blew
Whereto the waves and reefs send up their roar ;
And then I hastened to the brink to view.
Two majesties-the blue horizon, bound,
And the great city which the harbour crowned.

Well, matcs,iit was awhile ago,
Soinewhoro in fifty-one
I mind it well-'twas just tho time
The-diggings had begun.
And thousands then werojfooking hore
To dig the goldou soil,
They thought, poor souls, to free themselves
At once, from years of toil.
Some did no doubt, yet many a ono
Long mourned tho day that he
Left friends and home in England dear,
To cross the raging sea.
For oh ! such sights as I havo seen,
Such misery and pain ;
I'd not for Ballarat's red gold
Behold the like again.
Whole families beneath a tent,
Where scarcely room to lie,
Andfjjabios'ibornlwithjnaughtîbotween
The mother and the sky;
And all their small belongings
Spread out for sale. Ahme !
How many an aching heart there were
Upon that Melbourno quay.
But, to my yam : There came one day
A vessel to that shore,
With many a heart, impatient to
Dig up the golden ore.
And some had monoy-more had none,
But left it all to chance :
Then- only thought was-Ballarat,
Their watchword-On, advance 1
Now one had brought his wife with him,
And Jane, their little girl,
With Saxon eyes and head o'orrun
With many a'flaxen^curl.
And Janey, she had brought with her
(The fact I well remind)
A Primrose-in remembrance of
The homo she'd left bohind.
'Twas in a tiny flower-pot, and,
Among their little things,
Says she, ""Dear mother, put it out,
We'll take whate'er it brings
Perhaps, a loaf of bread."" Just then
A bushman passes by,
With curious glance on all around,
The Primrose caught his eye.
He stopped, then thought, ""Why that's the first
I've seen for many a year,""
Tho only one I've ever seen
Since I've been over hore.
"" What want you for tho flower1, my lass ?""
""A shilling, Sh-,"" sho said,
"" I would not soil if we did
Not want it to buy bread :
""For all tho way from Devonshire
I've brought tho little flower,
And tended it upon the voyage,
And watched it hour by hour :
""And now it's hard to part with it-""
"" You sha'nt,"" tho bushman cried,
"" Hero is tho shilling ten times told,
And keep tho flower beside :
""And I say, lass, just water it,
And put it up for show ;
There's scores will pay to look at it,
Aud glad too, sure I know :
"" For hundreds hore have nevor seon,
Since first thoy took to roam,
A flower to call them back to mind
Their dear old English home.""
And so poor Janey kept tho flower,
And hundreds came to view
Her Primroso ; and the lassie found
Tlie bushman's words como true.
For luck set in that veiy day,
Her father struck tho gold.
Now manya night by the camp-fire light
Tho Primrose yarn is told.
It's true-I saw it all myself ;
So never moro disdain
Thc palo hodge-llower : if o'er you do
Remember Primrose Jane.

OPINION.
Opinions, like the vapours on the wind,
Wander diverse, nor leave a trace behind;
Reason and candour are high sounding names,
Which folly echoes and presumption claims;
And shallow critics, in this flippant age,
Pour forth their crude remarks on every page--
Distort each sentence, and make nonsense plain,
With notes and comments, impudently vain.
The luckless bard, whatever be his aim,
Can please but few unless he have a name.
Whether his muse some luckless wanderer guides
O'er dreary plains, or deep and boisterous tides;
Whether his fancy paints the enchanted spot,
The murmuring fountain, or sequestered grot;
Whether, in mournful numbers, he should tell
How passion triumphed and how virtue fell--
With retrospective visions charm the eye,
And claim the tribute of reflection's sigh;--
The critic blames--the luke-warm dolt admires,
And, in affected rapture, half expires;
The Misses sigh--the drowsy dotards whine
""How very pretty!""--what a charming line!
Observe the critic!--mark his vacant stare--
Sagacious shrug--and all-important air;
Distorted mouth--knit brow--and half closed eye;
His solemn gait--his itch for mystery--
His profound nothingness--his obscure phrase--
His adoration of the ""Ancient Days;""
And what a combination will you find
Of senseless words and barrenness of mind!
He prates of genius as the punch goes round,
And, dozing, groans forth many a vapid sound:
He dwells with rapture, on some jingling chime--
The most unmeaning is the most sublime;
All common sense bespeaks a want of sense,
But palsied drivelling marks intelligence;
A coarse hyperbole ia feeling's voice--
A tumid sentiment refinement's choice:
Of taste he prattles in incongruous strains,
And all sobriety of thought disdains.
Nor do I wonder that these dolts abound,
When such unmeaning rhymsters, too, are found.
So much for critics. Let us now behold
A thing as senseless, tho' perchance less bold:
The whining boy-bard, just escaped from school,
With nonsense crammed--enough to make a fool--
With fractured sentences of morbid rhyme,
And thoughts absurd, mistaken for sublime;
Some sceptic doubts the strippling's head possess,
Which make him err the more, but think the less.
But, good or ill, t'were cruel to condemn
With cynic dogmas and capricious phlegm.
He will improve, if nature be his guide;
If not, he sinks in Lethe's soothing tide.
He may indulge in many a harmless strain,
And teach his muse her sallies to restrain.
Again he sings--the aid of fancy craves--
""Thy star-like eyes have made a race of slaves;
""Thy lovely form with Juno's may compare;
""Nor can e'en Venus boast a cheek so fair--
""Where the pale lily mingles with the rose,
""And music's breath in every accent flows:
""In dreams, I meet thee in some ocean isle,
""Where fountains murmur, and where vallies smile--
""Where Spring, with flowery vesture, clothes the
ground,
""And seraph forms seem ever floating round;
""Thro' the moon's beams their fairy figures glide,
""Bathing their tresses in the dewy tide.""
A verse like this e'en censure would not blame,
Nor crush the enthusiast's visionary fame.
But there are shameless coxcombs who presume
To pillage sacred genius in the tomb:
With volumes fenced--with magazines beset--
And duns and punch to keep him on the fret.
He dives for lines, with most industrious skill,
And twists, and turns, and moulds them to his will.
No bard is safe. The flash of brilliant wit
Is crampt and hampered, his coarse brain to fit;
Nor Pope, nor Beattie, nor the Prince of Song,
Escape these would-be minstrels' paltry wrong.
To jingling Tauze we lend an aching ear,
And for his dancing rhyme return a sneer.
Bid ---------- no more, to gain a fame,
To Southey's number's tack his own poor name.
To puling JUVENIS, we say again,
Stick to thy desk, and spare thy barren brain.
Before thy pen affrighted reason flies,
And, in convulsions, gasping rythm dies.

The Choosers of the Slain.
[In Memoriam E. O. Meston, aged [?].]
A. MESTON.
Brisbane, November.
[In the old Norse mythology there were ""Three
Sisters""—the "" Valkyrrior""—who went forth from the
halls of Asgard to select those who had to die.]
The iron gates unfold again,
They come—the "" Choosers or tbe Slain 1""
Weird f isters from the Asgard City,
'With steel blue eyes that know no pity.
They go U a mother with endless fears;
To a father with grief too deep for tears.
They seek for a child serenely fair,
A blue-eyed girl with golden bair.
A sudden dreadful shadow falls
Across tho floor, along the walls I
And awful aa the words of doom
Tho silence of that lonely room t
The mother kissed the dying child,
The fair young face looked up and smiled.
She saw the shadow on the wall,
She heard the voice from Odin's Hall t
Cold was the Fatal Sisters' breath,
The soft bloc eyes are closed in death.
And slowly through tbe Iron Gate
Ride back the Messengers of Fate!
But not alone, between the Pair
A blue-eye J girl with golden hair I
And elsewhere in a darkened room
A mother sits in voiceless gloom.
Hot tears are falling on the bed,
Her heart is icy as the dead.
And in a graveyard, still and lone,
Two stand by a recording stone.
And read of one new bnrisd there—
A blue-eyed girl with golden hair.
And both in silence bow below,
A parent's first and bittor woe.
The child they loved has gone before,
Where pain and sorrow come no more.
And angel spirits guard her well
On Asgard meads of Asphodel.
But oft the tears unchecked will flow
From those who loved her here below.
She lives upon that bnrning scroll,

*LAMENT OF THE SINGLE LADIES OF
SYDNEY,
'te're ready, we're ready, it really is hard,
That from Hymen's sweet bonds, we so long are
debarr'd;
'The men are so cautious, the hard-hearted crea
tures,
That they care not for all our blandsmiles or fair
features.
There are plenty of red coats, we like them the
best,
B3ut they're just like the others, when put to the
test.
They tell us we form the delight of their lives,
Yet they very weIl'manage talive without wives;
Of dinners and balls, our papas give them plenty,
:Of hints'it is true, our mamas throw out twenty ;
They accept all, the dinners, they dance at each
ball,
They hear all the hints, but won't take them at all!
They bow when they meet us, and say we look
charming,
'Or the weather is cold; .'tis their hearts that want
warming ; -
They laugh and they chat, and thea pass for our
beans,
Yet 'tis very provoking they never propose !
If they knew all the graces and glances we learn,
They surely would offer to make some return
What is it they want ? Oh ! sadly we fear,
That the charms they require are some hundreds
a year.
'It is said they are rather deficient in purse,
But we'd venture to take them "" for better for
worse.""
We parade thro' the streets, and we walk on the
pier,
And all for such cold sefish wretches-oh dear !
Our Mammas (poor vld souls,) trudge about ev'ry
day,
'rill their legs and our patience are near worn
away;
The men might possess some respect for old age,
And by taking their daughters, their troubles
assunge ;
And put altogether we're a good-looking set,
A better assortment the Gents will not get.
We very welLknow, all men's tastes dont agree,
iBut we are as complaisant as women can be,
We're to some sentimental, with some we coqnet,
We languish and smile, but no husbands we get!
Our ohs! and our ahs ! pass quite harmless by,
What a torment that men now-a-days are so shy.
Oh ! if 'twere the fashion for women to ask,
(To some, by-the bye not a difficult task,)
flow delightful 'twould be to pick and to choose;
Of course the men would not attempt to refuse !
-But'alas ! we are doomed "" not unsought to be
won,""
If it rested with us, 'twould be very soon done.
'Tis a terrible thing that men wont understand,
They are really the plague and the pest of the land
Our Papas and Mamnmas, get cross and look glum,
As much as to say, ""yot've been too long at
home.""

Their tender fringe, and strain their pulsing veins,
No more the tempest's wrath the boughs shall break,
And bruise them, scattering o'er the wild wide plains.
Nor evermore the quiet mists may fall,
And fill their graceful frondage with soft dew
Nor summer sunlight, in the dawning, call
The forest sap to fill their veins anew !
The springtide saw them in their opening sheen,
Ana autumn burnt them into golden red
Andjrusset-mellowing summer's vivid green
Andi winter bleached them when their life was fled.
They lived their life pf sun, and dew, and rain,
And peaceful fading, fell to earth's calm breast.
So may we pass away at last from pain.
And aleen for ever in unbroken rest !

Did angels shatter two blue, blue stars
And shape them into eyes,
When twilight covers the grey helars
And curtains the evening shies,
Or. lest for this earth they be too wise,
Are they but flame of the fireflies?
Did spirits steal, when the dawning glows,
Down ipto the dew-wet fields,
And snatch the red from a drowsing rose,
The magic a poppy wields—
When, slow and seldom, that curved mouth
yields,
Do lovers dream of the poppy-fields?
Or, as the languid lids unclose,
Where the snamed warm blood will rise,
Do they ponder on a dew-cool rose
That budded in Paradise,
Or of groves, where the wild flower grows.
Whose strange deep rooting no mortal
knows?
Did fairies pluck from the thistle-down
The white that is delicate,
Did they leave the tall stems, stripped and
brown,
And free from that feather weight,
To make the snow, 'neath the dark hair's
crown,
Of brows where the love-locks cluster
down?
Did the God of Day, when hours were fair,
Lean out from his arch of blue,
Mix sun and shadow to make your hair,
And twist it in a wreath for you?
Ah! well did he blend the sunlight there
With deeper tones of your nut-brown
liair!
Did the prisoned soul of a violin
Break out from its polished wood,
To find in the songs of trees its kin,
And its yearning understood;
Did your voice gather the beauty in
Of the sweet strayed soul of a violin?
And where did they find your complex
heart?
Deep down in some mermaid's cave,
Where the long green seaweeds sway and
part
To kiss of a reckless wave.
The harps of syrens were rived apart
For strings to twine in your complex
heart!

Eurobodalla! euphoniously named,
Why are thy flora and fauna unfamed?
Wherefore in silence still reigning among
Charms that but wait for a wooer of song?
Wild is the westwind and wilder the weird
Flutter of leaflets where wild men were speared;
Murmuring voices too, seem to bemoan
The midnight disturber in language unknown;
Or are the sounds simply intoned by the breeze
Brushing its way through the native oak trees?
Who were the many that moulder beneath
Mounds now encumbered with mazes of heath?
Fled are their spirits from mortals--but where?
Point with the finger, who can, and say, there!
Secrets, enwombed in the ages to come
Leave all our boasted philosophy dumb!
If there be spectre-like visitants seen
Where aboriginal battles have been,
Oh! that they would to my vision unfold
What through the cloud-rifts saw Ossian of old!
This is the field where dark warriors encamped,
Stolid self-will on each visage enstamped;
Here, where their forefathers quietly slept,
They fought and they feasted, they laughed and they wept
Sweetly the wattle trees shed their perfume
Over old mysteries mantled in gloom:
Wherefore attempt to unveil them? 'Tis knaves
Only who gloat o'er the opening of graves!
I am no pansophist: nor would I seem
More than I am in my own mystic dream.
Thread we our way through the thickets to gain
Glimpses enchanting of moonlight's domain.
With visions of beauty our senses are fraught
Ever expanding and filling with thought!
Cottage-lights beaming from regions around--
Tell where the settlers' new clearings abound--
Culture of soils is extending across
Valleys enrich'd by the teeming Tuross.
Sweetest of scenes, as if meant to allure
Waters so peacefully flowing and pure,--
Carpets of verdure, as if to sustain
The brightest and best--yet must I with pain
Tell of dark spots on the picture? Oh can
Blots from my pen fall alone upon man?
Party strife rages--profanities roll
Where but love's image should shine in the soul!
Fierce animosities often enflame
Neighbours who neighbours are only in name!
Wherefore do nominal Christians surpass
Heathens in heathenish feelings? Alas!
Eurobodalla! To mourn o'er the change
The white man has wrought--is as painful as strange;
But ere he distracted thy beautiful dream,
Savages knew of no God to blaspheme!

Editor. What shall we say to the pub-
lic ? Our friend Jjjvenai., in consequence
'of the cavalierahip of our late treatment of
him, has declined all further connection with
our "" Miscellany."" To the public this is a
very serious, and, we fear, irreparable loss.
Juvenal is caustic, but he can also be kind.
He has a keen perception of the follies and
faults of others ; but, we know, that at the
same, time he bears about with him a heart-
felt admiration of excellence in everyshape.
We have no doubt that had his "" Botany
Bay Eclogues"" been differently received, the
bile of his composition would have soon
been expended, and we should have had a
valuable collection of family portraits sus-
pended in our literary gallery for the benefit
of our latest posterity. To our own feel-
ings, we confess, the loss of Juvenal, as a
contributor and companion, is a distressing
event :
"" As every kind of parting bas its stings.""
'We had reckoned upon him as a constant
attendant on our soirées. Our reliance upon
his judgment, in relation to "" men and
things,"" here, gave a sort of confidencee to
our opinions, which we felt likely to stand '
1 WS in good stead on many a needful occa-
sion. How his place is to be supplied we
do not yet foresee. In our present soiree,
. we are under the necessity of examining our
literary contributions by ourselves. There
is wanting in consequence, on our part, all
the cheerfulness which is the usual compa-
nion of an agreeable chit-chat.
It is odd how one loss will suggest ano
""ther. We have lost our friend Juvlnal,
and the public their friends of the XXXIXth.
We could not resist following the gallant
fellows to the wharf on Saturday morning,
.and witnessing their embarkation. The
"" game of war"" all over the world, is now
less likely, we trust, than ever heretofore,
to be played again. The growing intelli
* gence of mankind,-their experience of the
i horrors and conviction of the useleasness
and folly of most of the wars that have been
waged in time past, tend, we think, to ren
' der them less and less eager to
--"" cry havock, and lot sup the dog« of war.""
In other words, the occupation of a soldier
is becoming of less consequence every day.
Yet the "" pomp and circumstance"" of mili-
tary discipline creates a deep interest in the
movements of a military corps. Besides,
these gallant fellows, who have just stepped
from our shores, have been the protectors of
our property and the guardians of our civil
rights, as well as our safeguard against the
invasion of foreigners; and we confess,
although no peculiar bond of intimacy had
been formed between ourselves and any of
the corps, our feelings got fairly the better
of us, as the band struck solemnly up the
affecting tune of "" Auld lang syne,"" and
the boats were towed slowly from the wharf.
We imagined that the cheers were heavy
hearted, and that there was a loathness to
-part, on the side of those on shore as well as
. of those who were moving away, highly
creditable to both parties. We are sure
they carry with them the best wishes of our
. community ; and we feel convinced that
they are not likely, in any future canton
jnenr,""to enjoy more real happiness than
^they have experienced, as a body, during
the time they have been stationed in this
Colony. And Colonel Lindesay, good
honest soul, carries .with him the good will
and affection of all who know him. The
kindness and conciliation which have nni
? for ml y marked all his proceedings here will
ever render his memory beloved. If we
mistake not, he has the best claim to the
Crawford title. The present Lady Mary
Lindesay Crawford is now an old woman.
'We should rejoice to learn that he waa en-
rolled among the' Peerage of Scotland.
Parting with the heroes of Albuera very
naturally leads us to insert a very pretty
sonnet expressive of feelings somewhat in
- .accordance with our own at present, which
we owe to the kindness of our respected
contributor "" Eta.""
SONNET.
I've seen again the spot on which we stood--
The shell-strewn beach from which I saw thee part,
When thoughts of deepest grief rush'd on that heart
Whose anguish'd swellings rose as did the flood;
And still the sense of that remember'd hour
Comes with new force across my fever'd brain:
'Wakening those pangs which o'er my soul have power
To break its spell, and burst its earthly chain.
And still the tones of that remember'd voice,
In soothing accents, strike upon my ear:
Soft'ning that heart which can no more rejoice
In all it has borne--all it still must bear.
But, like the music of a well-tun'd lute,
The sounds still vibrate, tho' the strings be mute.

Sydney, 1832.
'We have received, too, some very spirited
.* Anacreontic verses"" from our truly poeti-
cal friend H. H. And we are sure, from
the opinion we do not hesitate to pass upon
the merits of his contributions, he will give
us credit for sincerity when we express our
extreme regret in not feeling ourselves at
liberty to give them insertion in our "" Mis-
cellany."" Our position, as a public jour-
nalist, leads us also to consider ourselves as
a guardian of public morals; and, as we are
decidedly of opinion that every well-wisher
to this community ought to check, in as far
as his influence goes, the unfortunate pro-
pensity to make too free use of wine and
ardent spirits, which prevails throughout
the colony, he will understand why we would
deem it a direliction of our public duty were
we to publish {which we could not do with-
out approbation of its merits) the present
contribution of H. H"" which is a very
elegant and spirited drinking song. By the
bye, we have learned that Doctor Lang, of
the Scots Kirk, has it in view to preach a
sermon on the subject of drinking next
Sunday morning ; with the view of rectify-
ing, to some extent, the habits of the po-
pulace, in preparation for their approaching
encounter with the contagious principle of
cholera morbus. The experience of all the
physicians of Europe goes to assure us that I
habits of dissipation and debauchery emi-1,
ncntly predispose the frame for imbibing t
the contagious poison. Of course, wert
the disease to get footing on our shores, wt
are to expect the most melancholy conse-
quences from the established prevalence oi
this predisposition among the mass of oui
population. This sanitary effort, on tin
part of Doctor Lano, is the only one whicl
we have heard of as being taken with tlu
view of guarding against the inroads of oui
approaching foe. We confess that we an
not sanguine in expecting much good iron
a solitary sermon from a solitary pulpit.
The town, as we suggested before whei
treating formally upon the subject, ought ti
be divided into districts, and the clergymen,
with proper assistants, ought to ply theil
daily walks among all ranks of the populace ;
with the view of cleansing out, ere the
cholera morbus commences its ravages, the
Augean stable of habitual impurity, which
has its ramifications throughout every street
and lane, and alley of our town. A society
of ladies, too, ought to be formed, for the
purpose of aiding in accomplishing the
general rectification of the dissolute habits
of the people.*
These observations haveded us away from
several topics of less grave import, which
would have been more appropriately noticed
in our Miscellany. We had a lengthy poeti-
cal piece marked out for insertion, and a
prose jeu d'esprit besides. Both of which,
however, we must keep in reserve. Mean-
while, as a relief from the sombreness ol
these observations, our readers may not
dislike the following stanzas from our friend
"" Erin"" :
STANZAS.
When thou wert true
The earth was dear and fair to me;
Joy shone in every bell of dew,
The sunshine always spoko of thee,
And swiftly every moment flew,
When thou wert true I
When thou wert true
The sky in clouds was never drest ;
Eternal flowors their fragrance throw
On valley's lap, and mountain's crest :
Thorns on roses never grew,
When thou wert true 1
When thou wert trne
No tempest churned to wrath the woves ;
The winds were calm, or only blew
In gusts around false lovers' gravea I
Oh, no! I ne'er misfortune-kuew.
When thou wert true!
When thou wert true,
There was a smile on every brow ;
No seasons paled the rose's hue.
And fruitage hung on every bough ;
Birds warbling through the gardens flew,
When thou wert true 1
Now thou'rt forsworn !
And earth seems chaos to my view ;
A prison on a dark sea borne,
And mortals all a demon crew.
Who smile on crime and virtue scorn,
For thou'rt forsworn !
Now thou'rt changed,
Tho 6kv is ever dark and drear;
Owls flit where gentle linnets ranged,
And fruits are harsh, and flowers are sear,
And hopes are dead, and friends estranged,
For thou art changed !

* We promised not to return to the subject
of cholera morbus unless with a view of
giving such extracts or condensed informa-
tion respecting its history, or progress and
treatment, as we should deem likely to in-
terest our readers. We are unwilling to
dwell unnecessarily long on one topic ; yet
we think public attention is not sufficiently
awake to the importance of preparing for
the worst. There cannot be needless alarm
upon such a subject : and of this we are
sure, that, granting cholera ""morbus never
were to visit our shores at all, in the act of
making proper preparation for its reception,
in getting rid of the filth and fulsomeness of
the dissipated and debauched habits of our
general population, an amount of good would
accrue to the community which could not
easily be accomplished, without the aid of so
powerful an incitement to moral reform as
may be made of the fear of falling victims
to the pestilence.
The following quotation from the "" Spec-
tator^ will show the sentiments of those in
London who were inclined to treat with
contempt all fears upon the subject ; who,
at all events, held the prescriptions of the
Board of Health of a precautionary nature
in "" utter abomination.""
"" The great question is not whether cholera is
contagious or not, but how are we to manage it, now
that, notwithstanding all our attempts at barring
out, it has come among us 1 Of the way in which
the quarantine has been kept, a good deal has been,
said. We honestly believe, that it has been kept as
well as quarantine is ever kept. Common sense
revolts so strongly against the confinement for three
or four weeks of men in perfect health, without any
obvious or intelligible reason, that they are never so
confined. Where actual sickness is on board a ves-
sel, we believe the regulations are pretty strictly
insisted on ; where no sickness exists, they never
have been, and never will be. The vessels by which
it is alleged the cholera was brought to Sunderland,
only attracted attention after it broko out there ; no
one thought of isolation before. We ourselves saw,
four yellow flags floating in Ramsgate harbour, in
the midst of three hundred vessels, without any
visible means of preventing intercourse between all
of them. If vessels coming from a suspectée] port
were subjected to a medical inspection, and if such
of their crews mid passengers as were in health,
after a careful ablution and fumigation if necessary,
were permitted to take the mail as their lotters are,
the public would have all the security it ever can
have, and no personal inconvenience would bo the
result. But the twenty-one day's quarantine is an
easier-applied remedy ; it requires no thought-that
bane to the peace both of the makers and executors
of law.
"" We who, being the greatest naval power in the
world, and possessing the most active and numerous
coast guard, are most oopable of enforcing it, hove
seen the inutility of quarantine; is land quarantine
more efficacious 1 Russia, with a population of ma-
chines rather than freo agents-an nrmy which
obeys and murmurs not-functionaries disturbed
by no considerations of reason or mercy towards the
publio or individuals-tried land quarantine, and
failed. What is the conclusion from all this, but
that cholera, he it contagious or non-contagious
whether it travel by * the highways of human in-
tercourse,' which the one party aver, or as the crow
flies, which is the opinion of the other-cannot be
shut out by legal enactment-that it will be in if all
the world gainsaid it 1 Does not every principle of
reason, then, as well as of fear,.dietate to us that we
should piepare like men to grapple with the enemy
whom our long balla coimat reach t
ti
lie
.*' AU tbe doctors seem to agree that filth, cold,
damp, famino, or bad food, ero predispoaors to olio«
lora. Let us, then, heartily and rationally, and in a
kind spirit, sot about the romoval of tilth whero it is
matter of publio nuisance, and tho counselling of its
removal where it is purely domestic. The poor are
tho most porsuasiblo of all persons whero (hey have
no suspicion of tho adviser- Thoy will demur to
beadle, with his mop and pail and big looks ; but
lot a respectable neighbour only point out calmly
the danger to themsolves nnd to otbors from acou
«nulntionü of nastiness, and there will bo an imme-
diate flourishing of brooms among tho laziost and
most aputhetio of the race of Maclaines that hive
in Dyot-stroot. For cold nnd damp, and bad food,
the remedy lies in tho putses of the rich. Let them
be freely opened. Finn no1 waistcoats for tho men,
flannel potticoats for tho women, a blanket for their
beds, a bag or two of coals for their chimnios, a bit
of meat for thoir pots,-theso are quarantine regu-
lations which have never failed of ofioot, because
those who aro subjected to them have no interest in
evading their application. Let tis havo boards of
benevolence in the first plaoe ; and let the boards of
health follow when thuy are called for.
"" The poorer class are at prosont set against tho
rich ; thoy are taught by ' errant' scoundrols, who
speak to tlieir sufferings, that not only tho uppor
but the middling classes are their natural enemies
und oppressors. Let the rich hy their gifts, and the
middling classes by their labours of love, prove in
the most effectual way the falsehood of this mon-
strous doctrine. Let them oppose to the oratory of
the Rotunda the prevailing voice of warm-hearted
Charity ; whilo Hunt declaims about political dis-
abilities, let them apply a ready remedy to physical
evils, and instead of noisy applause bestowed on
thoso who inveigh against the rich, thero will bo
hisses as hearty as ever visited the ear of a borough
monger or a political bishop. If when we have
blankets for every bed, shoes and Blockings for
every pair of feet, and, as far as wo can, a morsel
for every mouth,-if when sowers are dug and cess-
pools drained, cholera doos como to us, as porhaps
it will, then wo may safely say, oven to that most
formidable physical affliction, ' Rejoice not against
us, O our enemy 1'
"" On the subject of modical treatment, it belongs
not to us to speak. When the disease has once
shown itself in a largo town where there isa doctor
in every street, common sense says that tho wisest
course is to call for his cousel. As, however, the
oholera is extromely rapid in its strides, and as pre-
liminary measures of cure ara quito capable of boing
taken by tho members of the patient's family, we
may be excusod for giving from an excellent autho-
rity the following simple directions :
"" ' Although safety is scarcely to bo hoped for
in the absence of a professional mun, it is neverthe-
less of great importance to point out to the friends
of tho patient what steps may bo safely taken be-
tween the accession of the disease and the arrival of
the physician. The patient ought lo be immediately
placed in warm blankets, and surrounded with bot-
tles of hot water, bags of hot sand or salt ; end
every other means of applying di y hoot which may
be within reach, ought to bo resorted to. The whole
body ought to bo rubbed with hot flnannel, and the
belly should be covered with mustard poultices,
which should also bo applied to the calvos of tbe
legs.
"" ' I have seen so littlo good to result from the
application of the hot-water bath, that, even if it
should be nt hand, I should not put a patient into it.
Ono great objection to the application of hot water
is the fatigue which it occasions the patient, besides,
that any benefit attending it is generally neutralized
by the difficulty of drying the body, or by the eva-
poration which takes place during that process,
"" * Laudanum is usually to be found in overy
house, and certainly ought to be so during the pre-
valence of this disease; but the friends of the
patient must be cautions of administering it in large
doses without the sanction of a medical man. A
tea-spoonful of laudanum, added to six table-spoon
fuis of brandy, may be prepared, however; and one
table-spoonful of this mixture may be administered
in half a wine glassful of hot water every quarter of
an hour,-five drops of essence of peppermint and
ten drops of sulphuric ether being added to each
dose of the brandy and laudanum. In caso the sto-
mach reject the liquid, pills containing three groins
of camphor, and half a grain of opium inay bo
given ; and if tho irritability of iho stomach bo so
great that it rejeots all that is swallowed, a warm
glyster of arrow-root, with a tta-spoonful of lauda-
num in it, should be injected into the bowels.
'' ' As a measure of precaution, all these remedies
ought to be at hand; but in towns, of course, medi-
cal attendance will probably be obtained in time to
admit of their being applied under saaotionof a pio
fessional man.
"" ' Early bleeding is of so much importance in
this disease, that, if possible, it should be resorted
to even before the arrival of the regular medical nt.
tendant of the family.. The rule is to bleed until
the blood, which is black and thin when a vein is
first opened, assumes a red and more natural colour,
and until the oppression of tho patient is relieved.
In the couise of my practice I have always found
tbat the danger is, that too small rather than too
large a quantity of blood is removed.""
We may notice, moreover, that our last
accounts from the Cape show that our fel-
low-Colonists are taking the matter to heart.
"" This disease,"" says our fellow-Journalist
of the South African, "" is contagious,
rapid,-eminently fatal,-and tlie medical
profession have as yet discovered no certain
method of treatment on which they can re-
ly-much less do they pretend to have
found any specific remedy, as in the case of
intermittent fever« I
"" The question for the Colonist» therefore is,
what measures should be adopted by the Govern-
ment and individuals when vessels arrive here from
infected ports'! .. . . We would strongly re-
commend the formation of aboard of health in Cape
Town without an hour's delay, and we are confident
that the good sense of the inhabitants would induce
them to adopt their suggestions-or, if compulsion
should be necessary with a few, the publio safety
would justify its use.""
In the accounts from Scotland, the case of
Musselburgh is mentioned as peculiar.
Musselburgb consists of a group of four vil-
lages on the East coast of the Firth of
Forth, about six miles from Edinburgh.
The population is between five and six
thousand. It is one of the healthiest places
in Scotland, with wide streets, a beautiful
river running through its centre, and a har-
bour unconnected with the river, formed by
a double jetty or stone pier, capable of con-
taining vessels of SOO or 400 tons burden*""
Its only trade is with the Baltic for wood.
From the accounts we have perused with
regard to the extraordinary prevalence of
the cholera in this town compared with
those around, we have no doubt that it must
have been imported direct from the Baltic,
and not have been introduced along the line
of communication from Sunderland. What
confirms this idea is, that among the deaths
are those of Mr. Mitciiel, the chief wood
merchant belonging to the place, and some
members of his family. We think that the
case of Musselburgh forms a very strong
addition to the many proofs now admitted
as sufficient evidence of the contagious cha-
racter of this fell disorder. /., i
A Temperate Medical Adviser,
About three years before Swift's final decay, Dr. '
King observed he was affected by tbe wine which
he drank alter dinner, and, next day, on his com-
plaining- of hil health, he took tbe liberty to tell
him he was afraid he bad drank too muoti wine.
The Dean was startled, and replie J, that he always
looked on himself as a very temperate man, and
""""' -never exceeded the quantity his physician pre«
re scribed. "" Now hie physioian,"" continues King,

COWPER.
OH! who has not valued the blessings of home?
With all its endearments and ties which rest there,
And though to more favoured warm climates we
roam,
There are moments when memory owns them less
dear.
Whatever's the motive that prompts us to rove,
Tho' more envied the station the ""Exile"" now fills,
Yet remembrance will turn where his first early love
Was foster'd and bless'd, though on less sunny
hills.
For there's not any breathing, possessing a soul,
But they feel the link BINDS them, the farther
they roam;
So in this distant land--the extreme of the Pole--
There are times I regret the endearments of home.

Such funds accumulate.

They said, 'it would be great.'

Controlled them for a year, __ . .

On assets of our own,

'That we could float a loan?'
'I doubt it,' said the Socialist,
And groaned a doleful groan.
'Oh, Savings, come and walk with us!**
The Premier did entreat;
'A little walk, a little talk.
Away from Barrack-street;
My Socialistic friend will guide
Your inexperienced feet.'
'We do not think,' the Savings said,
'A Socialistic crank,
Although he chance just now to hold
A legislative rank.
Can teach experienced Banking men
The way to run a Bank.'

They passed an Act or so
To take the little Savings out
And let tiiem iiave a blow.

'The. way to run the show.'

Can show them what is what.

There are fairy tales astounding
That are harboured by adults;
That are fostered by -professors
Shrewd, of ease and comfort cults.
They are fairy tales of fear,
That still hold the mass in awe ;
Fairy tales of sheerest fiction,
With the force of unwrit law.
But these fairy tales unreal
Do not hold me in their thrall.
I am free, and would pronounce it
Loud, defiantly to all.
Now I've broke from human oxen
Who are shackled etill with fear,
I can see the herd, and hear it
Lowing, yoked to fear here.
Ah, these fairy tales astounding
Do not make me lie to men ;
But they make me want to flail them, till
They'd cast their yokes and then
I would meet men laughing happy,
Whose religion would be truth.
We would feel no yokes of falsehood
In our intellectual youth.

AN INTELLECTUAL BELIEF.
Truth, in its universality, is God
In manifest operation round about :
And in so far, in our apportioned sphere,
As we evince or vindicate the Truth,
The Parent of all good, do we serve God.
And also, in so far as we endeavour
To champion or educe it, but fall short
Of our intent through thwarting circumstances
Superior to our measure of control ;
Then the mere WILL must represent the seed
To the advantage of our souls, beyond
The passage of the Grave ; and with the amount
Of actual good attained to in the Past,
Continue to advance them on their starry-march
Of infinite progression. This believing,
I must believe as well, that in so far
As we abet, perpetuate, or induce
Error, the Parent of all wrong, that just
So far we serve the Devil ;-or that principle
Which, through the Spirit of Humanity,
Opposes Truth ; and for which dereliction
From the straight purpose of benevolence,
There must in justice be some penalty
Here or Hereafter-yea, a penalty
Proportioned in its wrath to the Offence ;
And for so long as this, in its effects.
Refers to its occasion. ""Wherefore VIRTUE
Is HAPPINESS;-not here? then elsewhere; through
That everlasting harmony which attests
The final fitness, as a complex whole,

Ra*itt o» Mm of Busman.—Bare, almost
m great poet*, are consummate men of business.
A man, to be excellent in tbie way, must not
only be variously gifud, but hu gifts ahoald be
nicely proportioned to one another. He mutt
have in a high degree that virtu* which men
have alway* found the leaet pleasant of virtue*—
prudence. Hie prudence, however, will not b*
merely of a cautious and quiescent order, but
that which, being ever actively engaged, i* more
fitly called discretion than prudence. He re
quires a great knowledge of character, with that
exquisite tact which feels unerringly the right
moment when to act. A discreet rapidity must
pervade all toe movements of his thought and
action. He must be singularly free from vanity,
and is generally found to b* an enthusiast who
has the art to conceal his enthusiasm.
Thb PHOsrHomxaoHnca or m B«4.—Every
one recognises the beauty of th* singular
phenomenon that w* call th* phosphoreseeoee
of the sea, and has watched th* track of foam
and diamond point* of light left behind as th*
steamer cute the wave. For a long time th*
cause of the shining appearance was a puxtle to
philosophers. But the naturalist* finally cam*
to the conclusion that it is produced by animal
cules which are excited to luminosity when the
water is agitated. It was also shown that th*
phosphorescence is brightest, and th* sparks
most numerous immediately preceding an at
moepherie disturbance. Thus th* littl* animal
cula must be included in th* long list of d*lieat*
organisms that feel the approach of bad weather.
Professor Deeharme observed this coincidence
and has been diligently studying the habits of
the tiny creatures and their shining propensities.
He tells us, as the result of his observations,
that they are visible in tlie daylight with a glass
magnifying about forty tunes. They are, under
this magnifying power, of a lens-shaped form,
and from seven to fifteen hundredths of an inch
in diameter. They are of a transparent natare,
more diaphanous in th* esntr* than around th*
periphery of their little bodies. The specimens
experimented on by the Professor lived in a bottle
for sever*! weeks, and beeam* verr brilliant
when the water was shaken or starved, or when
ever a small quantity of exciting fluid, alcohol
or add was introduced into it. These infini
tesimal baromters, when fully developed, attain
the sue of from two to four thousandths of an
inch.
What thi Pabuium Bat.—Th* bakers,
the butchers, the grocers, cheesemongers, fish
mongers and poulterers have sent in their annual
bills to the Parisians, and pretty ones they are.
The bakers charge for 359,964 tons of bread,
betides about 1800 tons of floor. Th* value of
this nice little lot is not specified. The butchers
are more pro is*, and, in order to show the
character of the meat consumed, we copy the
invoice: Bullocks, 175,1*2; cows, 45,678;
eilves, 143,428; sheep, 1,068,062. This is in
addition to pork, and the total is estimated
at £6,306,499. Of game and poultry, 20,730
tons are consumed, and the cost of this lot is
£1,606,588. Fish v a heavy item—2B,B9l tons,
including 1010 ton* of oyaters, the total of the
fishmongers' account being £1,179,728. The
French are fond of vegetables, as bear witness
(he following figures: Potatoes, 12,603 tons;
carrots, 41,102; turnips, 7,744 < cabbages,
40,981; leeks, 25,200; parsnips, 2,402; salad,
12,060; cucumbers and gherkins, 7,080, and
melons, 624 tons; altogether 189,798 tons. Of
butter, upwards of 20,000 tons are consumed ;
5,104 tons of cheese; and among other kick
shaws and sweet things, 570 tons of pat**, 600
tons of gingerbread, 416 tons of sugar plums,
110 tons of sweet biscuits, and 148 tons of pre
serves and preserved fruits. On the favorite
cafe, £660,000 is expended. The French are
not a tea-drinking people, the value consumed
of that beverage, which "" cheers but not in
ebriates,"" being only £24,000, or but a 27i part
of that of coffee. About a like sum is spent on
ehoeolate; £18,000 on mustard j on pepper,
£22 354; truffles, £13,84*1 and saver kraut,
£10,080. These goodly sums are for the
stomach alone; and seeing that the Parisians
are the dressiest people in the world, what must
be the expense of belly and back together ? It
appalls one to think of it.— Scottish Farmer.
Thr Australasia*, of the 21st instant, says t
—"" About seven months since, Herr Yon Grue
rard, the well known artist of this city,
sent to the Emperor of Austria, through Pro
fessor Hoclistetter, a copy of his 'Australiau
Landscapes,"" published by Hamel and Fergu
son, of Queen-street. Bach of the lithographs j
was tinted by the artist, so as to gire full
effect to bis original designs; and th* Em
peror was so much gratified by the work
that he signified his intention of conferring some
distinguished mark of his favor upon Herr Yon
Guerard, whose father had been court painter
to the Emperor Francis Joseph the First, while
one of his ancesrors hud received from the Duke
o( Lorraine the hereditary knighthood which
has devolved upon the artist. By the present
mail Viscount Canterbury has received the cross
of the order of Frauds Joseph from the Em- |
peror of Austria, with a request that he will
forward it to Herr Yon Ouertrd, which has
been accordingly done. It may be interesting
to mention that Professor Hochstetter made
these ' Australian Landscapes' the subject of a
paper read before the Geographical Society of
Vienna, illustrative of the physical aspects and
character of these colonies, with whtoh the pro
fessor's voysge in the Novara had made him
personally acquainted. It is satisfactory to find
that local art is thus assisting to popularise a
knowledge of Australia in central Europe, and
that Imperial honors are being bestowed upon
colonial artitU.""",The Queenslander ,"628,191,187,787,827,773,803,847,838,722,899,750,790,758,693,751,830,876,906,875,809,880,699,762,848,743,464,596,869,870,913,912,764,864,912,904,909,907,902,902,907,905,904,904,883,861,905,907,907,902,902,906,905,904,907,890,908,905,907,906,910,907,714,861,909,906,906,907,909,912,908,885,904,903,904,887,887,910,910,912,913,907,906,901,906,909,906,908,908,909,910,902,879,911,888,903,908,93,864,892,907,905,904,909,904,907,906,904,907,904,900,906,906,904,898,905,901,901,907,899,908,896,882,908,904,890,907,909,907,890,908,909,910,910,912,906,912,909,865,868,893,910,892,909,890,928,910,884,911,909,910,909,908,910,907,905,905,931,907,904,904,905,905,909,899,885,905,905,907,907,907,306",Sat 4 Jun 1870,"1299,2375,2398,1356,1392,1424,1458,1528,1557,1625,1688,1723,1751,1792,1858,1890,1926,1961,2028,2061,2096,2129,2164,2230,2265,2299,2335,2493,2548,2603,2646,2690,2734,2789,2836,2879,2923,2967,3011,3055,3098,3140,3186,3231,3277,3331,3376,3419,3465,3509,3553,3597,3639,3682,3729,3773,3816,3860,3904,3948,3992,4036,4082,4142,4189,4231,4274,4318,4364,4405,4449,4493,4539,4581,4627,4671,4712,4757,4803,4844,4890,4934,4976,5019,5065,5109,5153,5195,5238,5282,5326,5370,5414,5458,5504,5545,5591,5633,5687,5731,5778,5819,5863,5909,5953,5998,6044,6087,6129,6175,6219,6265,6307,6351,6394,6438,6482,6529,6573,6616,6660,6704,6745,6789,6833,6879,6923,6965,7009,7050,7094,7140,7183,7227,7271,7315,7359,7403,7439,7501,7546,7589,7635,7677,7721,7767,7811,7852,7901,7940,7984,8027,8071,8115,8159,8205,8247,8291,8335,8378,8420,8465,8510,8553,8597,8639,8682,8726,8770,8814,8857,8899","5170,5731,5091,5060,5091,5060,5090,5060,5060,5091,5060,5091,5060,5091,5060,5091,5060,5090,5060,5090,5156,5060,5090,5060,5088,5060,5309,5101,5101,5102,5057,5058,5060,5106,5060,5060,5061,5063,5063,5063,5065,5065,5063,5065,5065,5109,5065,5065,5065,5065,5065,5065,5065,5066,5066,5065,5065,5065,5066,5066,5065,5065,5066,5109,5065,5066,5066,5068,5068,5066,5068,5066,5068,5069,5068,5071,5069,5068,5068,5068,5068,5068,5068,5068,5066,5066,5065,5063,5065,5063,5061,5063,5063,5061,5060,5061,5061,5060,5106,5063,5063,5065,5063,5061,5063,5063,5063,5063,5063,5063,5063,5063,5063,5063,5065,5063,5063,5063,5063,5065,5063,5063,5063,5061,5061,5063,5063,5061,5063,5060,5060,5060,5060,5060,5060,5061,5060,5061,5060,5102,5060,5060,5058,5060,5060,5060,5060,5058,5058,5058,5057,5058,5058,5057,5057,5057,5058,5057,5057,5055,5057,5055,5055,5055,5060,5055,5054,5054,5054,5052,5052,5050",27261156,Page 8

COME down, come down from the tall ship's side !
What a marvellous sight is here !
Look—purple rocks and criison trees,
Down in the deep so clear.
See ! where those shoals of dolphins go,
A glad and glorious band,
Sporting among the day-bright woods
Of a coral fairy-land.
See! on the violet sands beneath,
How the gorgeous shells do glide !
O Sea! old Sea, who yet knows half
Of thy wonders and thy pride?
Look how the sea-plants trembling float
All like a Mermaid's locks,
Waving in thread of ruby red
Over those nether rocks.
Heaving and sinking, soft and fair,
Here hyacinth—there green—
With many a stem of golden growth,
And starry flowers between.
But away ! away ! to upper day—
For monstrous shapes are here,—
Monsters of dark and wallowing bulk,
And horny eyeballs drear.
The tusked mouth, and the spiny fin,
Speckled and warted back,
The glittering swift, and the flabby slow,
Ramp through this deep sea-track
Away ! away ! to upper day,
To glance o'er the breezy brine
And see the Nautilus gladly sail,
The Flying-fish leap and shine.
But what is that?— "" 'Tis land! 'tis land!
'Tis land !"" the, sailors cry.
Nay!—'tis a long and narrow cloud,

Fair as the sun e'er looked upon,
There is an isle ruled by Sir John;
Who travelled far from peat and coal,
To grasp, with both his hands, the Pole.
This sailor was a jolly soul,
But though the Pole he could not gain,
(The icebergs made his labour vain,)
When he obtained his share of fame
He got a wife--'twas all the same.
The Lady F. as you shall see,
Was rather partial to the sea,
(As every sailor's wife should be;)
And gdod Sir John to please her whim,""
(And it was very kind.of him,)
Lent'her a. ship-she could not swim.

Then off sho with the vessel darts, f
Full of the sciences and arts,
To manufacture maps and charts,
And having made a merry cruise,
And filled a book with notes and views,
I Returns again to bring the news.
Now this had all been very well,
But for the matter I must tell,
llWhich to her ladyship befel.
There was an ill-skinned Nothing-do,
Whom they called Captain Montagn,
Who in a mighty passion flew,
And vowed that ship's wer'nt made to soil,
That stem and stern in some foul gale
Would all be swallowed by a whale.
That if Sir John did let his wife
Lead such a wandering kind of life
'Twould breed betwixt them dreadful strife.
"" Well,"" says Sir John, "" a pretty pass I
And do you think me such an ass
That I can't manage my own lass?
I tell you what, 'twixt I and you,
She shall sail, Mr. Montagu ;
She shall sail, sir, and so shall you.""
The captain was a clever man,
So say the folks that well can scan,
And after Lady F. lie ran.
"" Now, madam, listen if you please,
I've got into a pretty breeze,
To save you from the raging seas.
Says I, ' Sir John, pray take more care;
Sir, virtuous clever wives are rare,
We can't your precious lady spare;
If you don't mind for your own sake,
My duty is to be awake;
To lose her, all our hearts would break.'
And thus for looking after you,
The knight says ' Mister Montagu
She shall sail, sir, anld you shall too.'
Now, madam, as you knew before,
I've got a pretty berth ashore,
Worth fill eight hundred pounds and more;
And if you please to speak for me,
I will your humble servant be,

"" No less, good Mister Montagu,
Could I or any lady do,
For one so very kind and true.""
Off to tile knight, Sir John, she flew.
Now old Sir John lie raised his eyes,
As if examining the skies,
And looked both very nice and wise.
Says lie, ""my dear, I rather think,
And why should I the matter blink,
He'd not much mind to see you sink :
And should I let you interfere,
He'll say, in truth 'tis very clear
That your advice is weighty here.
So to show Mister Montagu,
There are some things you cannot do,
Madam, I shall not yield to you.""
Now if my story seems but tame,
And I confess 'tis rather lame,
The papers only are to blame,
For they are very much the same.

MY MOTHER'S PICTURE.
[Written by a Lady when very young, on an inci-
dent of early childhood].
My mother, ere my infant tongue could lisp
Thy name, I knew thy perfect semblance drawn
By painter's art; I knew and clapped my hands
For joy--then wept, and nought could quiet me,
Because those beauteous lips would press no kiss;
Those loving arms refused to clasp the warm em-
brace;
That silver voice was mute, nor with sweet song
And lullaby, would lull me soft to rest.
Poor hapless child! I little knew that grief
And bitter tears would follow riper years,
And I be left to mourn that mother's loss.
Though time has softened keener pangs, and dried
The tears of childhood, I shall ever think
On years long fled, with fond regret, and keep
Thy memory fairly graven on my heart; e'en now,
While gazing on the life-glowing canvass,
I feel the infant longing still within me,
And vainly wish those eyes could look, those lips
Could breathe the language of a mothers heart:
But thy pure spirit rests in Heaven. May I,
Like thee, by Christian faith, and well-spent life,
Receive a crown of righteousness, and join
Thy seraph voice in heavenly choir,
To chaunt the praises of a Saviour's love!

Men have said that ye were sleeping—
Hurl— Australians — back the lie;
Whet tbe swords you have in keeping,
Forward stand to do or die.
Hear ye not — across the ocean,
Echoes of the distant fray,
Sounds of loud and fierce commotion,
Swiftly sweeping on the way?
Hearts have woke from sluguish trances,
Woke to know their native worth;
Freedom with her train advances —
Freedom newly sprung to birth.
Despots start from thrones affrighted—
Tyrants hear the angry tread?
Where the slaves, whose prayers were slighted,
Marching — draw the sword instead.
If the men of other nations
Dash their fetters to the ground;
When the foemen seeks your stations,
Will you willing slaves be found ?
You the s0ns of hero fathers —
Sires that bled at Waterloo !
No— your indignation gathers—
To your old traditions true.
Should the cannon's iron rattle
Sound between your harbour doors,
You will rise to wage the battle
In a just and righteous cause,
Patriot flres will scorch Oppression
Should it dare to draw too near
And the tide of bold Aggression
Must be stay'd from coming here.
Look upon familiar places,
Mountain, river, hill and glade;
Look upon those beauteous faces,
Turning up to you for aid.
Think ye— in the time of danger,
When that threat'ning moment comes, —
Will ye let the heartless stranger,
Drive your kindred from their homes?
By the prayers which rise above you,
When you face him on the shore,—
By the forms of those that love you,
Greet him with the rifle's roar.
While an arm can wield a sabre,
While you yet can lift a hand,
Strike, and teach your hoslile neighbour,
This is freedom's chosen land.

There is joy at hut and homestead, in

When the rain drowns out the horrors

There is joy when spring is early,
when the bush is new and spruce,
And the river holes are fuller since the
nooa gave tnem a siuice.
There is joy in far-out places when tho
mailmen's motors loom,
And a joy, somewhere near Christmas.
when, the watermelons bloom.
Where the rushing creeks backwasbinz
leave tho silt l-eds finely spread,
There the drifting seeds find harbour,
with the wide trees overhead.
And the pale green vines eoon riot in
the warm protected shade,
'Till the pink-fleshed wonders ripen, and
the musterers make a raid:
Then with waist belts quickly loosened,
oh, it's 'give us stomach room!'
What, a joyous, (gorge)ous banquet
when the watermelons bloom 1
When the chinky at the homestead
does the job for which he's paid;
Where desert is oft related to the
southern canning trade.
Where the human palate hungers in
the everlasting heat,
For a taste of something different from
the variegated meat.
There the squatter and his missus, all
his toilers — even 'Choom'
Find new joy somewhere near Christ
mas when the watermelons bloom.
When the melon vines are blooming in
the creeks and silted dams
Where life's routine is steers and
beeves, and ewes, and Iambs, and
rams.
In a world that's old and simple,
where there's little that is new;
Where the vastness and the wideness
narrows down the pleasures few,
And there's not that city tenseness,
there the little joys find room,
And there's one, somewhere near Christ
mas when the watermelons bloom.

He watches at the sick man's side,
Still constant at the latest breath;
With love that will not be denied
To follow, and unterrified,
His footstep down the ways of death.
And we behold and question not;
So common is the wonder grown ;
How man such miracle has wrought
That to a brute's dull spirit is taught
A faith more faithful than his own.
Nor in some brute of gentle mood :
Not so; or were the marvel less;
""He watches at the sick man's side,
Still constant at the latest breath.""
But in the grey breast of the wood,
Athirst for rapine and for blood,
Is risen this soul of tenderness.
Man, if thou wilt explore the cause,
Ask of the deep and of the height,
And question of eternal laws
The power that all creation draws
Through darkness to the Infinite.
In sight nor word the answer lies:
Yet, humbly listening to thine ears,
Faint as from far, may murmurs rise
Of Love's majestic harmonies,
That rule the concord of all spheres.

""WHAT, Ellen, yet another bill
For dress? You will not stop until
My credit is quite gone.""
""Oh, do not fear,"" she made reply:
l dressed as well when Bingle t I
Intend to still keep on.
I know the cost; I also know
How much away on dice you throw.
Cigars, and costly wine.
*Tis woman's right to make the most
Or any charm that she can boast;
'Tte hers by right divine.
Say, did you ever know a girl
Who did not wish to be a belle,
And wear the latest style?
Or was the woman ever born
Who did not wish to deck her form,
And manly hearts beguile?
If there is such, full well I know
She is a dowdy, anyhow;
None care to win hor heart:
For, let tho men rave as they will
About our dress, we know they still
Like women to look smart.
There Is no doubt good Mother Eve
Who was so easy to deceive,
About her dress would fuss;
She cut the fig-leaves into Bhape—
I wish she'd kept the fashion-plate,
And passed it down to us—
With feather fringe she trimmed the skirt;
To out and gore she was alert;
With basque and polonaise,
Sho made the best of what she had.
We may suppose the best was bad;
But still she merits praise.
Unlucky Eve! she did not know
The grace a pull-back can bestow.
Or else wo may be sure
She would have made poor Adam stare.
Sho trimmed red rosos in her hair,
Then took a bridal tour.
I don't suppose she spent much time
On Adam s shirts to make them fine,
Because it is well known
The thoory that men profess
Is not to care a jot for dress,
But blame tho girls alone
For wasting time and hard-earned cash
To follow style and cut a dash;
And in that thought they revel.
But let tho sexes both be weighed
With even balance, I'm afraid
You'll find It pretty level.""

We hear a voice that calls to-day,
A voice that greets you as you go,
From the drought-cursed far selection,
Or where Barwon's waters flow,
'Tis the voice of many a mother,
Sister, sweetheart, left alone,
Loving all the lads in khaki,
For the sake of one lad gone.
And to-day it swells our voices,
Deepens still the undertone,
Praying for all lads in khaki,
For the sake of one lad gone.
From the bridle tracks we hear it,
Where the shingled cottage stands,
And in fancy see a woman
Praying, with uplifted hands.
Pleading that the God of Battles
In His strength may lead them on,
Watching o'er the lads in khaki,
For the sake of one lad gone.
Women who have never seen you,
Girls to whom you are unknown,
Cheer to-day the boys in khaki,
For the love of one lad gone.
So from fern-grown Burnett ridges,
And from mountains far away,
Voices of the lone bush women,
Cheer the lads who leave to-day.

WHEN THE MOON IS ON THE
HARBOUR.
When the moon is on the harbour, take
your thrilling violin,
Open wide the latticed window, let the
Bhapes of. faeries in.
And across the isles of Bilence wandering
thoughts of mine perchance
Will touch fingers with your fancies, in the
measure of a dance.
Every thought will be gowned gaily in some
garb of star or sea
Pink of sbell or snow of blossom, £or a
royal revelry;
Shod with moonshine or with star-gleam,
jewelled on the brow and hand,
With the pearl drops of the ocean or the
gold dust of the land.
When the moon is on the harbour, should
you wield your magic bow
Far away beyond the mountains, I at least
shall wake and know.
And if others pause to listen, surely they
can never guess
How the domino is loosened to reveal the
rainbow dress.
You can make a bridge of music, Pixy feet
must footing find,
Lest they sink beneath the waters, and
leave never trace behind.
You must set tbe silver transoms, low and
tender, smooth and sweet,
So they form a shining stairway as a wel
come to their feet.
It need not be strong and martial—fairy
shoon fall very light;
ailed '
But it must be railed with moonrays, lest
they miss it in the night.
And remember, when they signal, from
the dawn, a last good-bye
That vou must not seek to stay tlieiu, for
the fairy folk are shy!

H. Stockdale: The Australian aboriginal ha
many different forms of canoe, from the prlml
tlve riding of a log at Cambridge Gulf and th
five or aix mangrove sticks, about seven or eigh
feet In length, tied or pegged together, in us
by the natives of Roebuck Bay and other place
on the nor'-west coast in Kimberley, to th
great sea-going outriggers of Cape York an
the eastern side of the Gulf of Carpentaria
These canoes, which are capable of holding an
carrying with perfect safety from twelve to flf
teen people, and even more, with all their fish
lng apparatus, etc., are in all cases made fror
the trunks of the silk-cotton tree (bombax)
When felled they are mostly hollowed out a
once, then dragged to the sea by means o
ropes made from the tough creeping plant
growing profusely around thom. Some of thes'
cottonwood canoes are ns much as from fort;
to fifty feet in length, with good width at th
stern. When brought to the edge of the wa
ter two long tough and light poles of a wooi
growing among the mangroves, about twent;
feet in length, are bound across the gunwale
about midships. The ends are secured b:
pegging and binding to another long canoe
shaped piece of light wood, with turned-u]
pointed ends. At right angles across the tw(
first laid down, long poles there are then se
cured a number of shorter and lighter polei
that form a kind of stage or platform, on whlcl
is carried much of their gear. About the centre
of this platform a large lint stone is fixed, or
which they usually keep a small tire burning
when going any distance from land. This fire
serves the double purpose of warmth and foi
cooking any game or fish that they may cap
ture. They also carry wi til them an anchor-c
large stone very securely attached to a stout
rope of twisted creepers or climbers, which are
so strong as to bo almost beyond breakage,
I have seen the natives in these big outriggers
quite fifty miles away from the nearest land,
riding with safety and apparent Indifference
over rough, high seas. These outrigger canoeis
are fitted with sails, and also are propelled dur
ing calm weather by short paddles. This kind
of canoe, not only the largest but safest of all
In use on our Australian coasts, is said to be
impossible to upset, nnd I really believe such
to be the case, otherwise splendid long distance
swimmers though the natives aro, they would
hardly leave land so far behind them.
Strange that on some of our big Inland wators
canoes are unknown, or at any rate, I never saw
them there. Take, for Instance, Cooper's Crock,
With in places Its successive broad and deep
channels, which in Hood times run milos broad,
and oven in ordinary seasons have magnificent
broad and doop watorholos, many milos in
length. I never saw any form of canoo what
ever. Two of tho finest of those waterholes,
NappamerrI and Coolyamirra, often called Inna
mincka, aro even, during tho driest of seasons,
Still milos. In longth, and broad and doop enough
to hide ñ sunken battleship. On the last
named hole perished tho lllfatod leaders of tho
Burke and Wills expedition. What makes tho
apparent absence of tho canoo tho more re
markable ls that largo trees of a kind suit
able for the making of thom aro anything
but scarco In tho immodlato vicinity.
I have Been tho native worner cross some bread
tidal waters In tho nor'-west by simply casting
therein a big lengthy log of light wo-d-one with
a fork preferred-across which they made a rude
ctage, and placed their piccaninnies, dingo pups,
and the yams and seeds they had been gathering.
Then they pushed off, holding on to the log wllth
ene hand, and swimming with their legs the
while. They set up a great noise of shouting,
laughing and splashing, to keep off ""ol© man
ailllgator"" (all call crocodiles alligators) ""that
one plenty shout'em make 'im big one prlghten
ed."" I have at times during a lengthy bush career
had to make use of aborigllnal canoes more than
once for the saving of sheep during Hood time,
when we used the ordinary bark red-gum canoe
of large size from 12ft to 15ft or lGft in length,
md supported by spreaders and little, piles of
worked clay at each end. These canoes carry
about eight or ten sheep (with their legs se
curely tied), besides the native who acted as fer
. ryman and the white man to assist in unload
ing.

And these fair curls that I clipped to-day,
Are all that are left of my darling Ray.

H. S. : Thero is considerable speculation UL
the present moment OB to the chances of Timor
being purchased from the Portuguese by the
Germans. Should they succeed in purchasing
it I do not think they will huve made a bar
gain that ls at all likely to be a successful ono
from a commercial point of view. Both the
towns and harbours of Koepang and Dolli are
very unhealthy places. Many visitors are
stricken down with intermittent fever within a
day or so of their landing; in fact, tho native
boys themselves have severe attacks. During
a very short visit I saw some pretty doer,
which were kept as pets by many of the Ti
morese; also some small, common-looking sorts
of monkeys; but neither tho ordinary or tree
climbing kangaroo. Thc ponies are vory much
prized, and kept domesticated, very much after
our own fashion, though at times they aro
found to have been indifferently broken, and
some nro rather vicious. There aro many very
handsome animals nmongst them, running in
height from twelve to thirteen hands. I also
saw some long-snouted, half-wild pigs, and ate
some very palatable honey. One of their prin
cipal exports ls beeswax, which is gathered
from the wild bees, which build their nests on
the under side of the top limbs of tho highest
of the low, scrubby trees they can find. The
nativo Timorese climbs up the tree, taking willi
him In his girdle a knife for chopping off
the nest. Ho also takes with him a lighted
torch, which emits a strong stream of smoke,
in climbing the tree he uses a kind of creeper
rope, holding ono end in each hand, and, placing
the soles of his bare feet against Hie trunk,
v. rlgglos his way up very much the same as
our Queensland natives climb tall trees by the
aid of the creeper which they call ""kainin.""
I did not think them as expert as the Austra
lian. Once up, they creep along tho limb to
wards tho nest, mid when nenr enough they so
swing tho torch ns to cause a heavyish smoko
to surround tho nest, which is often close
upon a yard in diameter. As the smoko did
not cover the man, his bare legs and arms were
soon attacked by the bees, of which be ap
peared to talco little notice, merely brushing
them steadily off tho while he was affixing a
long cord around the nest, which completed he
used ids knife or chopper to sever thc nest
from tho limb; and having first taken a turn
of the rope round thc limb, he gradually lowered
lils prizo to his friends on the ground, when
thoy oat their lill, taking home tho remainder
in buckets made from the big leaves of a kind of
fan palm. Then the wax ls extracted for sale.
Thoro is no doubt that both gold and copper
aro to bo found in Timor; but from what I could
gather, and have since learned, oxperts consi
der thore ls very little likelihood of either be
ing got In payable quantities. Travelling ls n
matter of some difficulty In Timor, nt olthor end

mor ls a long, narrow Island, being about six
times as long as lt ls broad. Tho natives are
inclined to be toll, with thin, well-formed noses,
and aro not at all aggressive to Europeans, of
whom there aro a considerable number in Koe
pang, some of whom reside In well-built stone
houses. The Timorese aro a reddish-brown in
colour, and have very little hair on either faco
or breast; a few that had come down from the
Inland mountains were darker, and had thicker
and more frizzled beads or bair, and, if any
thing, lower in stature than the coast natives.
Their dress ia something like a long Scotch
plaid, and is worn twisted around the body,
the fringed ends falling to tile knees. A great

Mr, Dooley on tho anti-fat fad;-""Nowadays
'tis th' fashion to thry to omaclate ye'ersllf. I
ot supper with Carney th' other day. It was

but Carney bas a will Iv bis own, an' fr tin

Ho used to scald hlmsilf lvry mornin' with a

and gave him a thirst that made him take on
four pounds iv boodwelser. Thin ho rented a
horso an' thrled horseback rldln'. Th' horse
liked his weight no moro than Carney did, an'
Carney gained tin pounds in th' hospi

Nature had been kind to Carney in th' matter
Iv appytito. J won't toll yo what ho consumed.
It's too soon nf thor supper an' th' room ls close.
But, annyhow, whin his wlfo had tottered in

bogun to wonder whether lt wud bo safe to stay,
ho hauled a llttlo bottle fr'm his pocket an'
took out a small pill. 'What's that?' says I.
'Tis what 1 take lu place Iv sugar,' says ho.
'Sugar la ftittenfn' an* this rayjoocos th' weight,'
says he. 'An' nr-ru yo goin* to match that poor

""The latest thing that Carney has took up to

We need another cookbook giving
The rules successfully to make
A life as well as mix a cake.
Ah, yes, with living, as with
cooking,
We need a little forward looking.

And with our labor mix a smile.

No wonder indeed, that the robbers of Sydney
Are boiling with rage from the crown to the
kidney--
To see our electors renouncing their charters,
And yielding their rights with the patience of
martyrs ;
Determined to be represented no longer,
In councils where plunder makes robbers still
stronger ;
Where government minions, and government tools,
So oft picked our pockets, then, laughed at their
fools,
And so they can still do, we cannot resist,
Our five puny delegates scarce will be missed
In such a proud conclave of graziers and lawyers ;
Where ours were the pitmen, but theirs the top
sawyers--
Where they found invention, and we supplied
labour,
To pamper our greedy tyrannical neighbour--
To fill the exchequer of Botany Bay
And hear how they voted our money away.
Before we e'er thought of electing Lord Grey,
Methinks, I can now see Sir Charlie in fits,
Commanding D. Thomson to issue new writs.
If so, kind electors despise not advice,
The Grey horse won once, if he start, he'll win
twice.
Don't venture your money on government hacks,
Let the brutes stay at home at their plentiful
racks,
Or, graze in the paddocks, unbridled, unknown,
Until they can run for a prize of our own.
But, if we must send our Hohynyms to run,
Let Perkins, the oysterman, be the first one ;
Tis thought by a number that Peter would win--
Would go up Peter Perkins, come down Peter
Finn,
Or Sir Peter perhaps, if he could once get in.
The next should be Blatherum, famed for his
force;
He could talk for a twelvemonth, and never be
hoarse.
And if it be true, as Demosthenes said,
That his gesture is half of the orators trade--
I'll warrant if once they put Joe in a rage,
He would scatter their wigs and silk gowns on
the stage.

NEW YEAR.
By M. Forrest.
How the Old Year is dragging his feet!
His cloak is frayed and wet at the hem,
And his crown, that once was a diadem,
Has gone to the junk of the centuries
street;
But naked and soft and light, they pass
The feet of the New Year on the grass.
The gay balloons of the tired year
Are crinkled wrecks with all colour
flown,
And the New Year comes with his
brightly blown,
His head is high and his eyes are clear,
There are fresh rose petals for such as he,
For the Old Year—only a pot-pourri!
Yet that pot-pourri has a lingering spice,
And the dead rose petals still smell
sweet;
I shall strew some over the Old Year's
feet
As his breath grows faint and his heart
turns ice.
He shall know that one of us feels regret --
That he once was young, I shall not forget.",The Australasian ,"714,292,262,721,725,725,758,112,725,725,620,724,103,725,273,723,758,669,725,725,110,726,61,759,167,725,761",Sat 1 Jan 1927,"3002,3138,3202,3252,3295,3337,3380,3427,3465,3500,3571,3607,3643,3677,3714,3748,3784,3819,3889,3925,3965,3996,4033,4066,4103,4138,4174","1154,1363,1382,1132,1164,1165,1132,1197,1132,1130,1130,1164,1197,1165,1199,1134,1131,1132,1132,1163,1195,1165,1196,1131,1198,1133,1130",140726224,Page 56

By Maurine Cahill
WHY do poets always write
Of lovely spring or summer bright,
For a change just let us see
What winter brings for you and me.
Winter has its frost and snow,
But we don't care if cold winds blow,
For we can jump and skip and play,
And so keep old Jack Frost away.
Violets, wallflowers, daphne fair,
Shed soft, fragrance on the air;
And at night around the fire
Of weaving dreams we never tire.
Winter days are sunny, too.
Bright and warm for me and you;
So you see though winter's cold,
It brings joys to young and old.

ON THE DEATH OF AN INFANT RELATIVE.
And art thou gone-so early gone ! dear Child ?
But yesterday, and thou amidst us grew
Fresh as a breeze upon the mountains wild,
Bright as a blossom bathed in morning dew :
Another day is past-and thou art found
A mouldering fragment of the common ground.
Over the threshold of thy Father's love,
A voice of gladness hath gone forth for aye !
Nor Earth again, with the wide Heaven above,
May to thy Mother's heart, as day by day
She wakens to its grief, aught seem to be
But one vast Tomb of her sweet joy in Thee.
In vain she listens-through each silent room
Thy little footsteps come not as before!
Even passing things a look of loss assume--
Thy tiny finger points at them no more!
And thus thine Image ever claspeth she
Unto the bosom of her misery.
Ah me! what purpose had thy sojourn here?
Tow'rds what did tend thy transitory bloom ?
Cam'st thou but to exact Affection's tear,
And swell the mournful trophies of the Tomb?
Or like a colour of the closing day,
Only to smile thy little Self away ?
But watchful Heaven, perhaps, looked down, to know
The Spirit of thy destiny was prone
To wreck thee where the waves of Error flow
Round Sin and Shame and Sorrow's triple throne;
And pitying, ere thine innocent blue eyes
Saw evil, snatched thee to the loving Skies.
Or thus, or not,-yet thine's a full repose;
And thine a shelter from each future storm :
The hand that crushes the disclosing rose,
Destroyeth also the engendering worm,
Giving it, so, a victory o'er the might
Of coming Tempest and inbreeding Blight.",The Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser ,"709,60,772,716,599,656,674,613,718,591,669,703,694,785,676,682,589,651,632,596,457,675,677,617,698,530,517,803,531,674,759,617,648,631,663,621,579,562,633",Wed 5 Aug 1846,"1548,1640,1684,1732,1764,1796,1827,1861,1891,1937,1969,2001,2033,2059,2097,2144,2176,2207,2240,2272,2304,2351,2385,2417,2450,2483,2515,2562,2595,2627,2658,2689,2722,2769,2800,2832,2863,2895,2928","2938,3261,2907,2906,2906,2907,2907,2905,2906,2906,2904,2906,2906,2906,2906,2907,2905,2883,2883,2903,2907,2905,2904,2907,2906,2905,2906,2906,2905,2905,2906,2905,2906,2907,2905,2905,2905,2905,2906",683604,Page 1

Of all the Docks upon the blue
There was ho Dock-yard, old or new, , ; .
To touch the Dock at Cockatoo.
Of all the Ministerial clan ?
There was no nicer, worthier man
Than Admiral O'Sullivan.
Of course we mean E. W.
©'Sullivan, the hero who
Controlled the Dock at Cockatoo.
To workmen he explained his views —
'You need not toil unless you choose,
Your only work is drawing screws'.'
And sometimes to their great surprise
When Votes of Censure filled the skies
He used to give them all a rise.
'What odds about a pound or two?'
Exclaimed the great E. W.
O'Sullivan at Cockatoo.
The Dock-yard Superintendent, he
Was not at all what he should be—
He sneered at all this sympathy.
So when he s;ave a man the sack
O'Sullivan got on his track,
And straightway went and fetched him back.
And with a sympathetic tear
He'd say, 'How dare you interfere,
You most misguided engineer?
'Your sordid manners please amend —
No man can cossibly offend
Who has a Member for a friend.
'With euchre, or a friendly rub,
And whisky from the nearest 'pub,'
We'll, make the' Dock-yard like a Club.
'Heave ho, my hearties, play away, j
We'll do no weary work to-day.
What odds — the public has to pay!
'And if the public should complain
I'll go to Broken Hill by train
To watch McCarthy making Tain.'
And there, with nothing else to do
No doubt the great E. W.
Wtti straightway raise M'Carthy's screw.

A forest without end of dark boled trees;
A fern brake, full of crouching mysteries.
Straight lines of chairs a large, slow-moving fan;
A row of footlights, and a small stout man
Drawing the echoes of old tragedies
From the brown 'cello gripped between his knees.

And the calling linns of Clyde ;
Not "" far from Home,"" dear Lady,
Though severing seas are wide.
When misty plantain niches
Lit first with primrose flame
And amid the mossy tree-roots
Spring's frail blue hyacinths came,
The friends of other spring times,
Remembering, named your name.
When shone the summer hedges
Asnow with hawthorn bloom,
And the fragrant air was telling
Of clover and of broom,
The loving of old June-tides
Kept your old place and room.

Over the peaceful earth the early dawn
With tender tints breaks slowly, and the world
Again begins its toil with waking morn;
E'en as a stately ship with sails unfurled
Glides from the harbour to the seas' unrest.
Morning wears on to noontide, and the air
Is calm and still: the Sun God from his breast
Shoots down his scorching shafts on flowers fair
Till they begin to droop; but soon the sky
Is overshadowed and the mighty rain
Falls, and the thunders roar relentlessly,
But early dawn brings peacefulness again.

Polly-Hymnia and Clio.
Likewise dear Miss Callio-
Pe, now let me try, O,
To hymn this famious day.
Begorra I'd give something
For power to sing a rum thing.
And without ye I'm a dumb thin;,
On thi» sillybrated day.
Och ladies, jewel aid me,
To Helioon't fountain lade me,
Than, darlins, jell bare made ate
Quite up to nii( this day.
TU of Brisbane bridge I'm singin*,
Bat it's very hard to bring in
Three line* iv due rhyme ringin'
Notwithstanding this great day.
It require* Borne whisky pouch, sir,
Even aftber the Town Hall lunch, sir,
Whore was lashins of prog to munch, sir,
To narre me for this lay.
Agfa, in George-street what a fiusther,
When the sowlt began to clusther.
And in ranks commenced to musther
In the forenoon of the day.
There were Hawneys wid their bagpipe*,
And some wore smoking "" shag"" pipes ;
Faith we missed the wather drag-pipes
To lay the dort this day.
For the wind it was so gay
That it set the dost to play,
As it* compliments to pay
In honor of the day.
Then the Foresters were seen
With their collars of Lincoln grata,
And their flag of silken sheen,
Marching proudly on this day.
Then came the noble Templars,
To sarve as fine exemplar*,
Faix they formed a famous sample, sin,
Of Brisbane folks this day.
The Fire-brigade, too, starred it,
And their praise you might have "" hard "" H,
With some good jokes interlarded,
Aatong the crowd this day.
But the Vabanteers—och, bother,
Bs me sowl it makes me smother,
To think upon their pother
On this glorious f estial day.
Their jumping and their rnnnin',
Their screeching and their funnin'.
(BtjabanH was ■tannin')
Bound the Uuv'nor's trap thk aw/.
And their qnare parade did crown aIL
Jist afore our spkndid Town Hall,
But their pride recaved a downfall
From the Larrikins this day.
For the great Unwashed keptehanUg,
At our martial harow laughing,
While the mobs iiuide were quaffing,
Well—not wather, by-the-way.
But to oome back to my tale,
"" Uorporations"" stout and hale,
Boldly faced the dusty gal*
On this highly Cavond day.
Bays a aoorner, "" this procession'
Is simply the precession
Of the equine-ox-ial fashion""—
A purty thing to say !
Now, there bad been a dispute,
(By some scoffer set on footX
What sort of dress would suit -
To walk in, this great day ?
Then out the soorner dashes,
Whh "" In sackcloth and ashes.
Or ia emblematic katkts
Ye should open the bridge this day 1""
"" I don't mean to upbraid, Sirs,
Bat aueh hashes ye hare mad*, Sirs,
That it must bar* been your trade. Sirs,
To keep back the opening day.""
Well, the luncheon was a "" One-er,""
And the wine it was a stunner,
While each bombardier and gunner
Kept thundering away.
And when all were full as leeches,
Och! the party "" dinner speeches ""
Were recayred with lovely screeches
Of applause ou this graad day.
But the speechifying sport
Ends abruptly (see report),
For the Guvnor cats it short.
In the middle of the play.
Bays the Marquis of Xoruurwoy,
"" My promise 1 mtut stan' by,
1 hope I shant offend by
Sloping right slick away."" .
Than, rising from his chair,
lie walk'd iutue the air,
While that Tilisml mutf, our Mar*,
With the Marquis cleared sway.
Bad scran to that same Mare,
Was our strong "" inverted prayer.""
Why the (something) leave the chair
Upon this jovial day?
Why the wine is not half drunk,
Yet the erayture off has slunk.
Troth, he's nothin but a skunk.
Is our chairman, this; gnat day.
Amh ! many a fine oration,
Aftertadjous incubation,
Has rvcayved ■— it instiow
Ere its birth, on thk ski a»y.
Thus, the party was shut up,
Afther tasting but a sup
From the tantalising cup,
Oathisdtaippoiatiag day.

readers of the TOWN AND COUNTBY JOUBNAL.
They may have pets she would like to hear about,

escapes from injury, or been nearly lost. They
can tell their own hobbies and amusements, anec-
dotes of animals-anything that they think may

Market-street.
This is the last publication for letters received
in last month's competition. Next week the
space must be given to the new letters, of which
there are piles waiting to see the glory of print.
To get through these present ones in many cases
only a line or two can be given, so the writers
will understand.
""X May Ashmore .(Galathera) writes about her
pets. She has a dear little butcher bird that whistles
and a dear little piebald pony that is not broken yet.
Jessie Jamieson (Macleay Heads) has a
oat named Lucy, a bantam, three little chickens and
a native curlew. Her father, she says, is a pilot and
she has two brothers and two gardens.
A. W. Snipe writes an interesting letter about
Newcastle, the coal pits and coal trains, and about
Belmont, which is a pretty watering place where great
crowds go on holidays camping, shooting and fishing.
Edith Parr (Kenthurst) tells of a Behool pic-
nic they had to Berowra, how they went for a row and
then paddled, how she lost her shoes and stockings
and a search party went to look for them, and how
they were at last discovered under a rook.
Alma Purtell (Germanton) has three poddy
lambs and one of them will born you, and four pretty
little canaries and one of them died the other day ;
and two parrots and one of them can sing, and two
tame magpies and one built a nest in an old box and
laid two eggs and brought out a young one, and one
cold night she left it and it came into the house to
roost and it died.
Lizzie Merrick (Redfern) says it has not
been a very nice day, for it has not stopped raining
very long together. She won a prize at school, which
is called "" Little Fishers and Their Nets.""
Ruby Whittaker writes oï a pleasant day they
all had at their grandma's at Auburn.
Clara Parsons (Singleton) takes up a pen to
write a few lines. She came to Sydney onoe, and
thinks it ÍB a very big place, but very dangerous for a
stranger on account of the many cabs, trams, and
'buses, for if yon don't be careful you. may be
knocked down ana trampled on before you know
where you are.
Mary Arber writes to say she lives at Oakey
Forest, near Bowenfels, and likes reading the TOWN
AND COUNTRY and doing the competitions.
Jane Chant (Wombat) has had .;a trio to
Sydney, and visited the Zoological Gardens and other
places, and had lots of fun, ? ; , : '. ?'
Ada May Jones (lïyngan-road) writes on
both sides of the paper. Perhaps she and others are
shortsighted, and the rules in too small print. She
says they have a nice orchard and vineyard, and a
number of pets-a parrot that follows her wherever
she goes, a little mallee hen, and a Shetland pony.
She and her brother go but rabbit-coursing, and have
six dogs.
George Bourke (Oakhurst Farm, near
Canowindra) writes a nice little letter, but is
afraid Dame Durden will think (since he is ll) it.
I ought to be better; but he has always_ lived far away
from schools, and bèen very delicate. He ""and his
i sister ride four miles now every day to Behool, and
I wish they could attend more regularly.
Arthur Walker (Weldborough, Tas-
mania) says the place where he lives is very Bmall,
consisting of 150 Europeans and 100 Chinamen. - It
has been a good mining district, and stands on the
River Weld.
Laidley Grainger (Singleton) has a very nice
calf at home. He has only been to Sydney once, and
he likes reading. v -
Ada Whittaker (Marrickville) writes of a
pantomime she has been to see. She is going to live
at Auburn presently, and hopes to have more uéws ;
and she is learning music, and thinks it very nice to
be able to play when there is company.
Lilian Winter (Lismore) describes the publio
buildings in her town. .
Elizabeth Woodby (Newbridge) tells of the
occupations of the people at Newbridge, and describes
the fruit in her garden. . "" ..
May Potter (Taralga) says there are -four
hotels, three stores, one post office, and two fruit
shops in that town. Also_ there was a band of hope
last month, and she recited a piece called "" The
Disobedient Mouse.""
Linda Burrows (Penrith) speaks of the show,
just over. She got a special prize for a smoking cap,
and a joint second prize for other needlework.
Frank Stenz (Paradise Valley, Kangaroo
Camp) likes going to school very much, but does not
like the walk there, which is two and a half miles.
Also he has an objection to the cane.
Agnes Lugdon (Cootamundra), Florrie Pot-
ter (Werris Creek), Maudie Luckie (Bundulla), Edith
Cummings (River View) all send nice little letters
about pet3 or tho places where they live. ,

they are milking 37 cows for the factory, and he feeds
the calves night and morning.

bas no dolls, but owns a oat and a dog. She has
never been to Sydney yet, but would like to go.
Mary Oorrin (Sunnyside, Tenterfield) has
a little pet calf, white, with red ears. She goos to
sohool everyday where there is a garden. The pupils
have to keep in order.
Mary Drake (Pocolbin) writes a long letter
too long-but full of interest. She describes her life
from the time she came from England, and tells of
two narrow esoapes from drowning.
Lilly B. (East Kangaloon) also was born in
England. She is very fond of reading and gardening.
Edward Cubis (Coolabah), Septimus Mar
timer (Yarra Mundi), Edith Whitaker (Marrick-
ville), Mary Little (Coolabah), Bernie Owen (Ter-

Dear Dame Durden,-The little town ' in "" which,
I live .is situated on the right ' hand bank of
the Clyde River, about 10 miles from .""Bateman's
Bay. It has a population of about 400 people,
whose chief support is the timber industry..
The new gold find near Brooman has oaused great' ex
ment, and numbers of workmen are daily .passing
through to the rush. I hope that/the report of the
gold find will prove correct, as it will give employ-
ment to numbers of poor people who are at present
wandering about in searoh of work. Our home is
situated on a hill, and commands a finé view? of the'
river, which is about 50 yardß distant. Tho' chief
sport ia boating and fishing, as many fine schnapper
and bream, as well as other fish, may bo caught in- the
proper season. There are many varieties of Btag
hornB and tree ferns growing about Nelligen, as '.well
as the cabbage-tree palm, which is very pretty.-.

I have got three brothers and two sisters, but ! am
the oldest. My eldest brother has a little Timor,
pony, and it has a foal. We live out in the country.
We have no neighbor nearer than two miles away, rso
it is very lonely living here. We had a parrot;.it
had only a few feathers on it. It could not fly much,'
and it would not eat, and then it died. We have got
a boat, and we^ go for a row sometimes.-I remain,

ever been there ? The scrub is very thick, and vineB
growing from one tree.to another. We had a native
bear, but it died, and we.have.a cockatoo! We hada
nice sohool picnic I got a prize called "" Esther Reid
Yet Speaking."" We had racing ; I got a doll. There
was a Christmas tree, and it had a lot of bags tied ou
it; they had togo blind-folded and poke with a big.
stick. I poked a potatob, and then a tin money-box.
A girl there got a green frog. I am in the third class
at sohool. We are having very wet weather just now.

i larga city. There are very pretty hills ' round it ;
I they are called Governor's Hill and the'Rocky. Hill.'
They are"" parts of the Cularin Range. There ""are
several nice narks in Goulburn, but the prettiest one
is Belmore Square. There areJalways'plenty of chil-
dren playing in it. Auburn-street is the business
street in Goulburn. Our show is this week ; it is on
the 15th and 16th; all the schools go in free. It is
raining now, and it looks as if it is going to be wet
for the show. It will disappoint a good few people.
I am 9 years old, and I am in upper third in the big
sohool.-I remain, yours truly,
FLORRIE SALMON.
. Beresford, Cathcart.
Dear Dame Durden,-As this is the first letter I
have written to- you, I hope that you will enjoy
reading it. I will giveyou an account of our harvest-
ing this year. I am sure you would like what tho re-
sult is here. It has been a very wet season ; it has
rained frequently since Christmas, and has therefore
greatly interfered with the crops, to such -an extent
¡ that they have been destroyed. But this is not the ease
everywhere. Some were enabled to get their crops in
betweenrainy days. I believe that those who were BO
fortunate will have a very fair return. I am sorry that
there was so much rain and. BO many crops were
spoiled. The reapers first ont the wheat or oats with
a sickle and make sheaves of it, then make stooks of
the sheaves ; they then cart it in to a shed or make a
stack bf it. The threshing-machine comes round and
threshes the grain ont of the heads ; what is left is
called straw. The grain is next sent to the flour mill
and is gronnd into flour.-I remain, yours truly,

ANOTHER WORD FOR THE OLD FLAG. ;
Exalt the Union Jaok on high,
And from the mainmast let it fly,
. For all our foemen we defy
"" To stay its gallant streaming. ,,
Triumphant did its colors play .
Within Trafalgar's fated hay,
When, joining in the awful fray,
Unnumbered guns wore gleaming.
It bids its brave defenders meet ;
Death, rather than from foes retreat,
And binds thom as a winding sheet
lu their eternal dreaming.
God grant that it may ever wave
An emblem of the true and brave,
And provo unto the serf and slave
A star of freedom beaming.

last. I read your letters every week, and think they
are very interesting, so I hope to eoe my own among

interesting one though, as I have only a magpie to
tell you about. Ho is-very young, and is learning to
speak splendidly, his only fault is, ho is too fond of

Dear Dame Durden,-1 do not suppose you over
thought of visiting the. Clarence River ; if you did, I
do not think you would be disappointed, for it is very
pretty to go up the river in the steamers, and seo all
along the bank nice green corn and sugarcane grow-
ing. The last two weeks it was raining nearly every
day, and to-day it is fine and very hot. I am 15 years
of age, but not very tall. I have three sisters and
four brothers, some are older and some are younger
than myself. I of ten go along the Bonthern beach
and gather shellsj' and also go in bathing in tho sea.
I hope my letter will please yon.-I am, yours
sincerely, ^ FLORENCE PEGUS.

Dear Dame Durden,-I suppose you have novor
been to Bundaberg. ldc not think you would be
disappointed with it. The town is just recovering
'from the effectB of last year's floods. ' They were tho
largest we ever had. They did a great deal of
damage to the town, and the remains of dead trees
and bushes can still be seen on tho banka of the river.
The country is beginning to look very green after the
rain.. It has been raining very hard this week, but I
hope we will not have a flood. The town is surrounded
with sugar - plantations, many of which can bo seen
from the town. We live on the bank of the river,
and we get all the breezes from the river. Tho only
pet I have is a magpie, and he whistles and talks very
well.-I am, yours sincerely,

Dear Dame Durden,-l am going to write a^out
the farms in general about here. They aro very
heavily timbered ; in placee where the undergrowth is
not so thick the ground is covered with coarse gras3.
The principal' product is maize, most peoplo only
growing enough vegetables for their own use. Most
of them have about five br six cows, and rear all the
calves. A dairy factory is in course of construction
at Bowraville., The farmers generally keep.about 20
pigs. There has been a flood again this year on the
Nambucca Eiver, and it did a considerable amount of
damage.-I remain, yours truly, ,. s >,

Dear Dame Durden,-I am going to try for the
prize you offer. I am 10 years of age; I am very
short and stont. I have one brother and three sisters.
I am the youngest, and the baby of the family. I
have some dear little pots which I am going to tell
you about. I have three little kittens ; I have one
little pet chicken. I had two, and the mother of the
kittens^ ate one. She is very fond of carrying off
our neighbors' young chickens and ducks. .""-Mother
vows vengeance on the cat, but I cannot hear ofcher
being hurt. I have a rosella parrot; he is veryvoung
and he talks beautiful ; when he sees anyone coming
with his food he hops round the cage as fast as be
can go. I have a pet canary which sings beautiful.
I have a pet terrier dog ; I am teaching it-to jump.
It can jump as high as my head now. I wondecif
you have ever had a letter from any little girl in
Dungog before. It is a very pretty place, 'the- hills

Gold is now tie only theme,
Of nothing etae the people dream,
Botn young and oil distracted seem
About tie Derby Goldfield.
Excitement everywhere prevails,
Folks anxiously await tie mails,
Or liBt to all the new details
About the Derby Goldfield.
For Gold is now the only cry,
r m selling off my boys, good bye !
I mean to get some gold, or die
Upon tie Derby Goldfield.
Steamboats nailing everyday
Bring crowds of diggers ou their way.
Who mean to try their luck, they say.
Upon tie Derby Goldfield.
Bakers go to sell their bread,
For diggers they know must be fed.
The two-pound loafs a crown 'tis said.
Upon the Derby Goldfield.
The butcher, too, is in his glee,
A fortune's to be made, says be,
For beefs four bob a pound, yon see,
Upon tie Derby Goldfield.
The merchant, too, makes up his mind
That he must not remain behind,
For tea's six bob a pound, we find,
Upon the Derby Galdneld.
The banker takes bis scales and weights,
With his colleagues diBrnmeB rates
At which to buy from Bill and mates,
Their dust at Derby Goldfield.
The lawyer packs up wig and gown
And joins the throng with Doctor Brown,
The parson, too, gives up his gown.
And off to Derby Goldfield.
The snob packs up his tools and last.
And thinks he'll tiere make money fast,
For diggers wear tie leather fast
Upon the Derby Goldfield.
The sailor, too, his goose and shears
Packs up, and on the road now steers,
For pants are in demand, he hears,
Upon the Derby Goldfield.
The tinker sailor, shepherd, cook,
Have tinware, ship, sheep, pots forsook,
Clerks, too. throw coirn their pen and book,
And rush to Derby Goldfield.
Think not the publican's forgot,
He'U make the largest pile, I wot,
Nor care forups-and-downs, one jot,
He meets ou Derby Goldfield.
Policemen have been sent in bands,
To guard the gold from lawless hwds,
And see tiat orders just demands
Axe kept on Derby Goldfield.
Where is this fever going to end ?
Lots will lose yoa may depend,
And wish. Old Nick to Hades may send
The gold from Derby Galdfield.
There some would follow, I believe,
The thirst for gold, one can't conceive.

AN AUSTRALIAN BUSH SONG.
I left my daddy one morning,
And never gave any warning,
But off to the bush went roving;
With my bluey I did go.
By PHIL AGNEW.
Cnoaus.
Singing Ho! Hilly Ho! for off we go
Where the kangaroo bops and the wallaby
flop?,
Singing Hilly Ho 1 Ta-ta, Good-bye—
On the wallaby we will go.
I went to Bungaroo station,
And apked for a situation ;
Said the boss, "" Let's see your riding,
So jump on that moke in the yard.""
Singing Oh ! Hallo! for up I did go,
And didn't he kick, and wasn't I siok—
""Hold tight 1 Look outl my bold squatte*
boy"";
But I oouldn't squat there any more.
80, just to get my hand in,
I thought I'd try some branding;
So I made the iron a bright red hot,
And jabbed an old flow in the side,
And oh! Qreat Soott 1 she did perform,
And didn't I shiver, and didn't we slither
She caught the Black of my pantaloons
And landed me over the fence.
So, full of this botheration,
I cleared out from the station,
And, being a fool at location,
I lost myself in the scrub.
And oh 1 by Jove 1 Buoh brutes came round—
A ecake, by Jingo 1 and a whopping big dingo,
And an awful bird that laughed oat loud,
And leeohes crawled up my pants.
There came a mob of awful blacks
With pipeclay on their fronts and baeka,
And nulla nullas, clubs, and things,
And boomerangs and Bpeara;
Singing "" Yarra go, murra go, mcc a lah.""
They had a eorrobberie, oh I such a bobbarie,
Saying "" Burra go, warra go, yarra go, VghV\
Yes, that was the words of their Bong.
They gave each other awful whask?, •
And yelled And screamed like mantaw;
So I scooted like old Billy Oh,
And I'm going home to ma.
So now I'm off—Tata, Good-bye
To the Bweet pickaninny without any pinny,
And kangaroos, wallabies, 'possums, and
snakes—
So-long, Ta-ta, Good-bye!",The Queenslander ,"464,57,360,832,667,558,553,615,461,387,150,716,888,99,727,503,524,501,720,685,692,757,890,809,701,512,633,687,658,767,787,743,578,517,572,550,489,872,892,781,646,652,772,682,551,805,864,895,719,783,749,572,527,632,850,899,170,498",Sat 13 Dec 1902,"1351,1439,1526,1717,1948,2123,2164,2206,2249,2052,2337,2402,2444,2491,2531,2576,2663,2706,2750,2794,2836,2879,2923,2967,3011,3098,3142,3184,3228,3272,3315,3359,3403,3490,3534,3576,3619,3663,3707,3750,3794,3880,3924,3967,4011,4055,4098,4142,4186,4272,4315,4359,4405,4446,4490,4534,4578,4620","3394,3595,3444,3209,3296,3184,3184,3184,3184,3435,3548,3184,3186,3272,3186,3184,3187,3187,3187,3187,3187,3186,3187,3274,3186,3187,3187,3187,3186,3187,3186,3187,3187,3187,3187,3187,3187,3186,3186,3186,3187,3187,3187,3186,3186,3187,3186,3187,3187,3186,3186,3187,3184,3187,3186,3184,3272,3184",21807386,Page 63

When couples dally in parks ond
gardens
The imp of love will seize a chance,
And down on the foot-marked ocean
beaches
He's always urging for sweet ro
mance.
Hikers revolting out in the sunshine
Fail for his pot shots when they
park,
And lots of stunts he's always ar
ranging
Under a shop verandah dark.
A shop that shuts up soon after
night-fall
Uti'ers 'a home in front for love,
With often a low set 6tep for vest
ing.
And dew proof shelter up above.
There, where there's nought of ro
mantic flavour;
Heedless of every passing nark,
Love kocps warm until ripe for its
mating,
Under a shop verandah dark.
The parking's good whevc & snoP
stands empty.
Bark in a side street after eight;
There love thrives in the humblest of
makeshifts ;
Feet sometimes in a half numb
state.
Even away in the rural township,
Lovers love to giggle and hug-.
Scorning warmth where a cow s been
camping,
Under a shop verandah snug.
Motor-bike shrieks with shcilaa
straddling
'Rear- wheel cushions splutter awa- :
Out where the world cau't quizz their
courting ,
Or hear soft, thrilling things they
say. ,
But in where a small drab patch ot
shadow ,
Hvles from the street lamps
so-arching glare.
Love saves time that it turns to
sweetness —
(It doesn't take long lo slip round
there)
And who will say that the love's
not purer, . ^
Tfravinrr the passer's knowing grin .
Who wouldn't park w'th a good sort
sheila,
Lips to lips and chin t/- chin?
Who dare Ray that the love's not
greater ;
Fanned, perhaps, from a. dance floor
spark:
Strong enough for a cuddle in public.
Under a shop verandah dark?

Lord Kelvin, In distributing the prizes at St.
George's Hospital Medical School, said the
modern medical man must be a scientific man,
and, what was more, he must bo a philosopher.
The fundamental studies of medicino were of a
strictly materialistic kind, ibut they 'bolomred to
a different world from the
world which constituted
thoir main subject, the
world of lifo. Ho should
odd to thc subjects ho
had mentioned another
human nature. It was
with that they had lo
deal, and that carried
(hem far beyond doad
matter. Let them not
imagino (hat any hocus
pocus of electricity
or viscous fluids
would make a liv-
ing cell. Splendid and
Interesting work, of
.vhich some of thom knew,
had been recently dono in
what was formerly called
organic chemistry, a
groat French chemist
(oking tho load. That was
not the occasion for a
lecture on the border-
land between what was
(abed organic and what
v-qs called inorganic; but
I' would bo in forest big to
them to len ow that ma-
terials belonging to the
roneral class of food
p.'uf.'s, such as sugar, and
vVnt might be also called
a foodstuff, alcohol, could
1 o made out of the
chemical elements. But
lot not any of their
youthful minds be dazzled
bv i'm Imaginings of the
daily newspapers that
because Berthelot and
others had thus made
foodstuffs they could
make living things, or
that there was any pro-
spect of a process being
found in any laboratory
for making a living thing,
whether the minutest
germ ot bacteriology or
aro Illing smaller or greater. There was
an absoluto distinction between crystals
and cells. Anything that, crystallised could
bo made by the chemist. Nothing approach-
ing to the cell of a living creature had ever
yet been made. The gênerai result of an
enormous amount of exceedingly intricate and
thoroughgoing investigation by Huxley and
Hooker and others of tho present ago, and by
some of their predecessors In both tho ll)th
and 18th c n'urhs, was that no artificial pro-
cess whatever could make living matter out
of doad.

writes, in ""Pearson's Magazine:""-""In the early
fifties, it was supposed to bo tho height of in-
breeding and vulgarity for a man to bo seen
smoking a cigar in tho street, and tho smoking
room in n country house wns generally some
miserable room, considered too unattractive for

veterate smoker, stnylng at Windsor in tho days

in his bedroom, lying on his back, nnd smoking

[FOR THE SYDNEY GAZETTE.]
""MY LAST DOLLAR,""--A RHAPSODY,
To J. D. L. SYDNEY.
""Truly, he was the last of the rare,"" quoth mine host,
""and I shall never again behold the like of him any more ""
ANONY.
Loquitur Dollar.
Alas! alas! my days are done,
The race appointed I have run,
My weary course must cease;
Laid by in sweltering hose to rot,
Or doomed to grace the smelting pot,
Or banished to some savage spot,
In poverty and peace.
Oft to the poor I've been a friend,
When graceless rogues their pounds would spend,
At fair, or wake, or milling;
The toper swilled and sweetly slept,
For one last dollar still he kept,
Like that famed prototype 'yclept,
Don Philip's splendid shilling.
The miser held me first in fame,
Still on his lips there dwelt my name,
And that of Ferdinando;
He clutched me, as a hawk his prey,
I 'scaped as in his palm I lay,
And flew like lightning fast away,
For keep me, no man can do.
The bard with barley water muse,
With odes arranged in threes and twos,
To flatter, fawn, and cozen;
Hath looked on me his latest store,
And purged the brain with hellebore,
To catch him one idea more,
To round him off five dozen.
The plummet plunged to depth profound,
Still felt no bottom, still no ground,
To help him to Parnassus;
His hair and beard with foul disgrace
He tore,--while snuff begrimed his face,
And lengthened out each yawning space
With, ahs! ohs! and alasses!
In lower life a constant drudge,
I've paid for food without a grudge,
To fill the aching paunches;
I've cured the ragged rogues in gyves,
I've soothed the cares of men and wives,
And saved both hogs' and horses' lives,
By medicated drenches.
To settlers clothed in dungaree,
I've been a settler, they to me,
When in the horny fist,
Lest tipping chiefs should merit blame,
I've tipped the sub to pass the name,
To higher powers, that close the game,
For land, to make them blessed.
The slave with shovel, hoe, and axe,
Unmindful of the income tax,
Forgetful of Recorder;
To prove himself a flashy blade,
A caser knaps, and then arrayed
In metal hose, attends parade
In collar of his order.
One shakes a wary loon of brass,
The 'tother bribes to make him pass,
And shares with him his riches;
For me (excuse the slang I use),
A down I bear from hat to shoes,
And now both life and freedom lose,
From renegado snitches.
I've been assigned to nobler use,
Exchanged for bearing billet doux,
And purchasing prunella;
I've bullets bought and powdered pills,
I've bought the paper ink, and quills,
Red wax, and paid the postman's bills,
For bearing love to Stella.
I served bold Donald Scot a year,
For ne'er a man my price would ""speer,""
And Donald loved me well;
""Hout, tout,"" quoth he, ""its unco sair,
""To tak the trews from him that's bare,
""I'd rather keep ye clean and fair,
""And wear the auld mysell.
""The day ye gang frae me,"" quo he,
""Will be your last, so let me gie
""Ae warning to your noddle;
""I'll wrap thee in my Tartan plaid,
""No sun or wind thy charms shall shade,
""Though Andrew's dinner be na paid,
""I'll pay nae plack, nor bodle.""
""Oh whip the Scot,"" John Bullock cries,
""A Scot and sot are rife of lies,
""And both below a Par,--lo,
""Drive, drive each Celtic hero hence,
""How can a Scot have common sense?
""His pound is only twenty pence,
""And three make but a Carlo.""
""Give me the shining ore,"" quoth Pat,
""As much as fills my crownless hat,
""Pour,--pour the dollars bright;
""On turnpike road who drives along,
""To left is right, to right is wrong,""
And this is Paddy's ceaseless song,
At morning, noon, and night.
But Patrick cries, ""By night and day,
""I'll drive by right and left each way,
""The precious ore to gain;
""Whilst floating on commercial breeze,
""On paper kites let gudgeons seize,
""Give rags to them whom tatters please,
""Give me the flowers of Spain.""
My dollar! when I part from thee,
My deadly dolour thou shalt be,
Shall leave me in the dumps,
No massie draught to grace my board,
No porker in my pantry stored,
But safe in death's dark haven moored,

A CRUISE AMONG THE
ISLANDS.
[By Seajayk]
WHEN last penning this crude sketch
of a three weeks' cruise arnong the
islands I had reached the point where,
after spending one day at South Goul-
burn Island, we ran across the divid-
ing strait on the evening of August
28, and anchored in Mullet Biy, on
the Western end of North Goulburn
Island. It blew very hard during the
night from the S.E.After breakfast
the following morning we landed on
the beach at a spot where a curling
spiral of smoke indicated the presence
of natives. The first unwelcome fea-
ture noticeible as we landed was the
presence of swarms of flies—the first
and last place at which we were trou-
bled with this pest. They were about
the size of the common house fly, and
were the most hungry, persistent, and
troublesome of their species ever en-
countered. Throughout the whole day
they proved a perpetual torment. On
the higher land, a few yards back from
the beach, we found camped four wo-
men and four piccaninnies, and within
a few minutes two very old men came
sneaking out of the bush, whither they
had retreated on seeing us approach.
There was also one miserable and
mangy dog. They were all encrusted
with fifth and dirt, some had open
sores, and all had running, bloodshot
eyes : the surrounding atmosphere was
impregnated with an odour that was
as powerful as it was dis agreeable ;
whilst the filthy flies swarmed around
like bees, paying promiscuous attention
to both blacks and whites of the party,
and inspiring a shiver of disgust as the
thought crossed one's mind that the
little demons now trying to force their
way into one's eyes and nose and mouth
and ears had probably just previously
been exploring one of the before men-
tioned natives' open sores. The two
old men and the children were stark
naked, the four women had scanty and
dirty nagas. They were about the most
pitiful looking specimens of the noble
aboriginal in his native wilds this
writer has ever seen. After vainly
endeavouring to get from therm some
information re the island, they were
presented by Mr. Holtze, on behalf of
the "" Guv-ment,"" with some flour, to-
bacco, matches, pipes, &c. These gifts
they accepted in a calm, matter-of-fact
spirit, and certainly with no exuberant
demonstrations of delight or satisfac-
tion. In fact, the two old men were
so calmly dignified that they gave one
the impression tha they were confer-
ring rather than accepting a favour.
They could speak only a little ""pigeon
English,"" and the only thing which
seemed to arouse in them a flicker of
interest was the mention of some white
man or lugger on the coast they had
happened to meet or know. Appar-
ently they were the only natives on
either of the islands, the great majority
being away helping white men to get
trepang in the Liverpool River or at
some other part of the mainland coast.
Leaving the natives we walked away
Eastward. In the depression behind
the sandhills, near the native camp,
we found some native wells, evidently
the source of supply for the camp just
left. After walking about a mile we
carne upon a big swamp, about a mile
long by about half a mile broad, thickly
covered with green rushes. , Old high
water fiVol marks show that it covers
a far larger surface in the wet season.
Although of such extent the water was
in no place more than about four feet
in depth. There was a remarkable
absence of feathered life on this swamp.
Possibly the birds objected to flies. We
had hoped to get rid of these pests on
leaving the vicinity of the native camp,
but the whole island apparently
swarmed with them—a rather singular
fact, considering we had not noticed a
single fly on the neighbouring island
the previous day. After walking a
mile round the S..W. corner of the
swamp we kept on along its further
edge for the South-east side of the
island, passing over blacksoil flats with
some fairly big timber. We found the
swamp at its opposite extremity merge
into mangroves, and a maze of man-
grove creeks, intersected by one or two
long, sandy, grass-covered flats, ran
interminably to the beach on the S.E.
side of the island. We arrived at this
beach at a point where the ironstone
cliffs were about 30 to 40 feet high.
An old native pad led obliquely down-
wards. At the foot of these cliffs there
was some fresh water in a depression
between the cliff foot and an old sand-
hill intervening between cliff and
beach. Right on the beach we came
on the remains of an old trepanging
station. There were two huts-one
bark-covered, the other a bare skeleton
frame of bush timbers. Near by, old
stone and antbed foundations showed
where the boilers had been set, and
lying on one ot these was a roughly
fashioned dipper made of bamboo.
There was a strong S.E. monsoon,
blowing, and the racing white-capped
waves were thundering on the exposed
beach and breaking in long lines of
spuming froth. We snatched a hasty
lunch here under the shadow of a tree,
dodging the swarming flies as best we
could. Whilst doing so our lugger
came into sight round the long sandy
point to the Westward, beating her
way up to a previously arranged ren-
dezvous on the South side of the island.
As there was no crossing the network
of mangroves and creeks on this end
of the swamp, we retraced our steps
about two miles round its farther ex-
tremity, and then tramped about four
miles in a N.E. direction up the centre
of the island. Stringybark seemed to
be the predominating timber, and al-
though nor of great size, was growing
thickly. The nest of two bald headed
eagles was noticed in the top of a tall
old gum tree—the highest tree about.
The nest as viewed from below, resem-
bled nothing more than a great bundle
of dried sticks, roughly crisscrossed,
and about four feet in diameter. Over-
head the parent birds soared in wide
leisurely circles, watching the intrud-
ers and uttering occasional shrill cries
of warning. Not long after passing
the eyrie we came across several curi-
ous sunken pits resembling graves.
Three of these were ranged side by
side, and there was another about 12
yards away. They were about half
filled with earth, whilst the upper por-
tion wis partially covered in with dead
and withered branches. The natives
with us could not explain them. With
a natural curiosity Mr. Holtze ordered
Buckley (one of the natives) to clear
the sticks, &ci., from one of the pits.
With evident superstitious reluctance
Buckley slowly dragged out the with-
ered branches and then started to bur-
row into the soft surface of earth with
his hands. From a few inches below
the surface he recovered a piece of
corkscrew palm about 18in. long by
4in. in diameter, with a wooden peg
driven fairly through its centre ; also
a native yam digging stick. Owing to
Buckley's evident strong repugnance
to the task the work of disinterment
was not pushed beyond this point, and
the mystery of the pits remained un-
solved. The natives with us volun-
teered the opinion that the blacks had
only been "" play about,"" but the dig-
ging of such pits in the hard soil must
have been a rather arduous form of
amusement. After walking about four
miles we turned South and came out
on the beach on the South side of the
island at the point agreed upon. The
lugger had meantime beat up against
the strong S.E. wind and was anchored
about a mile off shore. Whilst wait-
ing for the boat to come ashore we had
a swim, and whilst in the water en-
joyed a few minutes respite from the
plague of flies. Someone had set fire
to the long grass through which we
had been wading during the last mile
of our tramp, and a sea of flame with
rolling billows of smoke went roaring
across the island under the impetus of
the strong wind. This wanton destruc-
tion of vegetable life vexed the soul or
our enthusiastic botanist, who, as
usual, had collected many interesting
specimens of plant life during the day.
On embarking we pulled for 200 yards
or more over a belt of live coral bor-
dering the beach, presenting beautiful
and variegated forms and colour effects
as viewed through the translucent
water. Myriads of flies followed us
into the boat, and it may be stated
here that the persistent pests accom-
panied us oh board the lugger and
made themselves a nuisance during the
greater part of they evening. As we
neared the anchored lugger we experi-
enced the full force of the wind and
sea, and owing to the carelessness of
those in charge of the boat narrowly
escaped what might have proved a
serious mishap. The deeply-laden
dinghy was pulled right under the
wildly seesawing bowsprit, instead of
being carefully brought alongside, and
would inevitably have been smashed or
capsized if it had not been for the quick-
ness of the one mani on board, who
spring out along the jibboom and
pushed the boat from under with his
feet in the nick of time. With the
strong tide racing through the strait,
the lugger at anchor, and only one man
on board, the capsizing of the boat
might have proved a serious business.
On getting on board the anchor was
at once hove up and the lugger was
run back under the shelter of the long,
low sandy point to leeward, where we
purposed anchoring till 10 or 11 p.m.
preparatory to a night run down to
McCluer Island, about 40 miles away
to the North-west.
Beyond some black and white cock-
atoos, some parrots,, and a few pigeons,
we saw no bird life on North Goulburn
Island ; and beyond signs of the pre-
sence of bush rats or bandicoots, no
animal lile was seen. We saw no in-
dications of minerals. There may be
some patches of fair soil, but it im-
pressed one on the whole as being a
more barren spot than its companion
island and if the fly plague is a chronic
feature it is certainly a place to be
avoided.
PINE CREEK RUMOURS.
[Echoed by J.H.N.]
It is rumoured that the Cosmopolitan
Battery is putting through the mill
stone from the Eleanor Mine, which is
giving a record yield of gold. Several
hundred tons of same are said to have
already yielded about five ounces to
the ton ; that there is more to follow,
equally good ; that many large nuggets
have been picked out of the ore bins ;
that the cyanide plant is being put in
order for the resumption of operations ;
and that extensive developments may
be looked for on this propeity in the
near future.
Rumours have been in the air for a
week or two to the effect that the idea
of paying Asiatics the same wages as
Europeans should be the subject of a
petition, and would be generally sup-
ported. (I commend the subject as a
good debatable one.) The idea is, of
course, that Europeans would then be
always preferred to Asiatics, and that,
the latter would be starved out of the
country without offendlng--as the Chi-
nese Government (or others) could not
object to a law which placed all on the
same level.
The steamer Empire arrived from
Southern ports on Tuesday forenoon,
moving alongside the jetty shortly af-
ter middiy. She brought eight Euro-
pean passengers inwards, and had 48
through Europeans and 208 through
Asiatic passengers. The vessel brought
about 50 tons of general cargo for this
port, and shipped about 11 tons of ex-
ports outwards. She resumed her voy-
age for Hongkong on Tuesday even-
ing
A subscriber points out that the
statement in last issue re shell being
worth £300 per ton is an exaggera-
tion. That is so, as at the last Janu-
ary shell sales we find that only one
class of shell realised that top price,
viz, "" Colonial Sorted "" Torres Straits
""C"" shell drought from £11 17s. 6d.
to £15 per cwt. At the same sale, by
the way, best Nasau Yellow-belly tor-
toiseshell realised as much as 90s. per
pound. Is there any of tb it part-ieu
( lar class of shell on this coast ? If so,

Original Poetry.
A Bush Selection.
[WRITTEN FOR THE ""QUEENSLANDER.""]
An old slab house surrounded by a fence,
That once was post and rail, now mere pretence,
To save the garden; out of line it stands
Or rather hangs together, for the hands
That should have kept it flnn in its old age
Have filled the gaps with saplings. Cattle wage
Unceasing warfare 'gainst each weakened spot,
And play the mischief with the garden plot.
An old Blab house—the slabs are good as new,
Untouohed by storms, although the win-Is blow
through
The inch of space that now exists between
Each slab. The heavy raiu and west winds keen
Find easy entrance, and the folk endure
What, but for laziness, they soon could euro.
(The roof of shingles is all old and rotten —
Shingles don't stand like slabs when long forgotten-
Many are missing, and their place has been
Supplied by tin, that once held kerosene,
Cat Into squares, and easily placed between
The other shingles. Still some gaps are seen
Waiting to let the falling raindrops in;
The fanner waiting till another tin
Is empty, or, perhaps the reason why.
Waiting because the weather now is dry.
There is no stable, though there is a steed,
A long-legged, skinny, half-bred, usoless weed-
Useless for work —each farmer wants a hack
To take him to the township, there and back
In decent time—you'll Hud, in many cases,
'Twill land a fiver at the local races
If it is sent to wiu, and he can square
The butcher who has got a bettor mare.
No milking shed for the half-dozen cows—
The profit no such luxury allows—
Only grass-fed, milked in an open bail,
The half-a-dozen scarce can fill a paiL
About the house a few fruit trees still grow,
Mostly half-dead, but why he docs not Know
Who planted them in land untrenched, undrained.
""Fruit is no good,"" he always had maintained.
Suoh waa Jaok Thomson's home, and suoh his life,
And, M not blest with brains, be had a wife
Who bore him children, and still did contrive,
Though oft hard set, to keep them all olive.
Before effect thero must, of course, come cause,
And bush selections follow Nature's laws.
Jack gave up ploughing, not without good reason,
The land was bad, uo matter what the season.
At best he could but plant and try to raise
On hit poor soil a scanty crop of maize.
When orops were good, then down the market fell;
When crops were bid. Thomson had none to sell,
80 he gave ploughing best, and looked around
For other work, if such could but be found.
He bRd oue bit of luck, the Government,
With ample funds, on rail extension bent,
Invited tenders for a line, surveyed
Not far from Jack's selection;' to bo made
Within two years. The contract Eoon was let,
And Thomson thought "" There's corn in Egypt yet.""
He bad no money, but a good new dray,
On the time-payment system, straight away
He bought, and worked eight honest hours a day,
Carting for sub-contractors; but bis pay
Was not all profit, for horso feed was dear,
And his young family grew with every year.
Bat this was long ago; tho stir and life
Of rail construction, and the frequent strife
Of drunken navvies at the old main camp,
Are talked of only when tho flickering lamp ""
Is lit, and in the uninviting room
Tries hard to chase away the evening gloom.
The horse and dray were sold—a backward move—
Jack takes life easy, and things don't improve.
Bush boys and girls have little of thcrfool
About them, but they must be sent to school
By force of arms. In this, 'tis such a pity,
They're not unlike their cousins of the oity.
But Nellie Thomson, though no model child—'
One likes them best—""well, just a little wild-
Was early taken with a wish to know
Why this was thus, and what was so and to.
Books Nell would read, whenever she could get them,
Till she got one on seeds and when to set them.
Nell rend of plants with names so very strange
That to pronounce them was beyond the range
Of her attainments. Soon she learned to priae
The many flowers that, as by magic, rise
To sun themselves beneath our Southern sky,
Making earth brilliant-blooms that glorify
▲ sixteen-perch allotment, if but taste
Ryflsoues the too oft bare, unsightly waste.
Nell vu the eldest, and her brothers knew
Her as their ruler—feared and loved her, too—
For oft she made them on a holiday
Work at her garden when they wished to play,
Or fish for catfish in the little creek.
The one redeeming feature of the place;
Bummer and whiter, down the waters race,
From some high spring their destiny to seek.
The bright lights thine on beauteous Brisbane belles;
Olad are the eyes that glance at other eyes!
Hark I now the music of the "" anthem"" twells,
The Governor I and all the people rise.
The bush selection and this scene so gay
Are brought together by our fairy's spell;
For many a plant and many a choice bouquet
Come from the home of clever little Nell.
The old slab house still stands, but on the hill
A good new house of weatherboards soon will
Defy the rain and all the winds that blow
From the four corners. Now tweet roset grow
In grand profusion down the gentle slope,
And fill wise Nellie's heart with joyful hope.

Oh! thou art laid in peace, and storms no more,
Shall reek their fury o'er thy fallen head ;
Unheeded now shall the loud tempest roar,
Nor harm thee couched beneath thine earthy bed,
Thou to eternal rest hast wearied fled.
Cold, dark and silent is this last retreat ;
O'er thy green-roof the winter rains shall shed
Their humid chillness ;— midnight blasts shall beat,
But thou in peace shalt sleep beneath the yew tree's
[feet.
In night's lorn noon, in winter's deepest hour,
When stormy skies the waning moon-beams shroud,
She shall usurp a momentary power,
And from behind the low'ring wat'ry cloud,
Tint with melancholy hue thy hillock round ;
Cold shall be her ray — pale shall be her beam,
Her sickly sight shall mark thy hallowed ground,
Then sink in shades of night, and all shall seem
A solitary desert — silent as a dream !
Above shall mournful to the shrilly blast,
The yew tree wave its aged boughs, and break
The awful stillness,— bending as it past:
It's time-worn creeking limbs alone shall wake
A grating sound — and from its silence take.
All shall be cold, and desolate, and drear ;
And on his grave the dripping boughs shall shake
The winter rain — and round the church tow'r near,
The wind shall whistling speak of midnight's bitter
[cheer.
But thou unharm'd, unawaked, in peace shall sleep,
In peace as silent as the steps of time ;
Thy lodging's dark, — thy chamber damp, — and deep
In earth's cold lap thy couch ;— but Oh ! the clime,
The change of season,— or the clayey slime
That stains thy dormitory,— the decease
Of untold ages,— the vile things that climb
And in thy bosom make long biding lease,
In thee excite no feeling.— Thou thalt sleep in peace.

How sweet and pleasant is the crystal stream,
Which murmurs thro' the bosom of the vale;
Just as gray light of morn begins to beam,
How sweet the soft and gentle Zephyr gale;
Which with a grateful odour seems to teem;
How sweet when nature seems to glow and smile:
And all around appears with blooming pride,
And with her charms our deepest griefs subside.
How sweet to watch the calm unruffled sea,
From the retreat of an embowering shade;
Where no human eye can penetrate or see,
(That sweet retreat for sweetest pleasures made,)
Where birds melodious chant their wonted lay,
Where howling storms are all in silence laid;
And the bright sun shines on the briny wave,
And wild temptests round have ceas'd to rave.
But sweeter far the charms of one dear maid,
Whom Angels will for ever guard and love;
Whose sweet lips whisper thro' the deep'ning shade,
Such bliss this world alone can never give;
Bliss which no earthly thing can ever fade,
Nor found in India's wealth, nor balmy grove;
Bliss which soon dissipates each jarring strife,
And gilds sweet friendship thro' the gloom of life.

tfrTH thia issue, the AUSTRALIAN TOWN AK
? COUNTRY JOURNAL enters into its fifteenth ye¡
of existence, and we therefore may he pardoned f<
taking our readers into our confidence by sayir
something of the ""inner life.""
The first issue of the TOWN AND COTJNTB
JOURNAL appeared January 8, 1870, and at one
it leaped into public favour, because it supplie
a publio want. The size of the journal was the
only 32 pages. In January, 1874, it was foun
necessary to enlarge to 40 pages, and the ii
crease of public patronage was BO gres
from all parta of Australia, that advertisers, part
cularly those interested in pastoral pursuit
cattle, sheep, horses, and other live stock, th
agriculturists including those who grow corn an
sugar, who make dairy produce, butter, cheese, &c
and the sportin gcommunity, whether horse-racing
aquatics, Cricket, or football, engaged their ind
vidual tastes-all these, and a host of others wh
had ships to convey our wealthy colonists to th
other cities or the old country ; or people wb
had anything to sell or buy, or missing friends t
find out-all these were quick to Bee the ad var
tage of advertising or proclaiming t
the publio their desire to do busines
through the TOWN AND COUNTRY JOURNA
in preference to any other weekly publicatioi
It became a very serious matter with the pr<
prietors as to the course to pursue, because c
the undue pressure upon the space occupied b
advertisers. There was nothing else for it but t
further enlarge the journal, and in 1877 the siz
was increased to 48 pages, and for th« time it wa
the largest paper in the world. Long before thi
it was stated plainly to other Australian news
paper proprietors that the circulation of th
Journal had already outstripped the old an
slow-going contemporaries, altho-igh some o
them had ten years start, but no response wa
made. With the enormous space of 48 pages a
command, we received gratifying evidences fron
all parts of the earth that the paper was fullj
appreciated. From the interior of America mei
wrote to make inquiries about our flocks an<
herds, and an experienced English - edito
said :
"" 1 must compliment you on your journal. We have ni
newspaper in England like it-so comprehensivo, so in
teresting to all olnsses-and so varied in its contents
Beside tho nows from nil parts of tho world, von supply ii
onopapor what wo have to Mibtoribehere to half a dosen for
1 notice it is a FARMEBB' JOURNAL,a FIELD, a SPORTSMAN, i
QUEEN, a YOUNG LAMES' JOURNAL, an ILLUSTRATE n
ft PCIENTIFIÜ JOURNAL, and a CORNHILL, all combined ii
one Issue.""
This testimony waa extremely encouraging, anc
it has been continued up to the preaent day. Th«
Christmas issue for 1883 was of a character eel
dom witnessed in any part of the world. Thc
picture, presented gratis with that issue to tht
subscribers, cost the large sum of .£1000. Al
though 50,000 copies were issued, yet it is within
the mark to add, as we could prove, that 60,OOC
copies would not have met the demand. For in
stance, the agents at Wagga Wagga, Goulburn
Bathurst, Albury, Armidale, Maitland, und thc
masB of Sydney agents and from Queensland were
almost frantic in their demands for additional
extra copies.
The enormous success has not been achieved
without large expenditure. Machine after
machine of tho newest and most approved design
has been erected, and addition after addition haa
been made to our already larere printing establish
ment. But they were not &xrfficient. We have at
laBt been compelled to look elsewhere for more
space and larger premises, and are now erect
ing an establishment in Market-street, near
George-street, on the aite of the old Waterloo
Stores, of a capacity which, we trust, will meet
our requirements for some years.
The TOWN AND COUNTRY .JOURNAL indeed oc
cupies a proud position, and this success the
conductors are fully aware is' due to -the Austra
lian people who have made thia paper their own,

COMPLAINT OF AN IMMIGRANT COOK.
Oft when at earliest dawn I sleeping lay,
Dreaming of home, and hopes long past away,
I hear in fancy's voice that thrilling sigh
When ""Come for your water!"" is the hideous cry.
How sweet it is, when Sol's meridian ray,
Bids sultry beams upon the water play,
To rest in shade, whilst sleep the eyelids kisses,
And wake to hear one bawling--""Clean your
dishes!""
And oh! at even, what soft, what soothing scene,
To watch so calmly rising--night's majestic queen,
And feel that--lonely sadness,--wond'ring if there be
Inhabitants in that bright orb--""Too late for tea!""
Oh heaven's above! that such romantic natures
Should e'er descend to boiling their own 'taters!
Oh Muses grant! thy sons may never rue it
For ""Cleaning their own boots,"" and chopping suet!

HOW?
If you would help a girl who is a
trier,
Yet let her win her way through
on her own,
To gain a goal you know she does
aspire,
To which you think she cannot go
alone.
A nobby girl who smiles a cheery
greeting,
Each evening when you meet her
after toil.
Although you know the toil is slowly
eating
Away the higher aims, you wouldn't
spoil.
What time you know the struggle she
is making
Is hardening her heart more than
a bit.
And not for worlds you'd let her
know you're staking
On helping her to get away from
it.
How would you go about your grand
intention —
A trait that still persists in human
kind —
And how your admiration in suspen-
sion;
And keep from off you face what's
in your mind?

We met: I was a stranger in the land;
""A little time, and we were closes mates.
How soon a little flame, though gently fanned,
Will grow in strength until it terminates
In blame grand! -
We met again: 'twaa at a festive ball—
I asked her card wherein to write my name;
The space was filled; I well remember all;
We quarrelled—yet I loved her all the same.
And that was all.
We parted; I to go my weary ways;
Bhe did not mind the anguish I was in;
Tossed to and fro on ooearTs giddy mace.
I tried to think me happy, and did grin
lho»e wretched days.
We met again; 'twas on a Bunny beaoh;
A little gonyah offered welcome shade,
And'lnto It we crept; there she did teaon
Me how to love, and fondly I obeyed—
Hands clasped in each.
We often met within that shady nook,

While she did tell her love as from a nage

Of that sweet passion which in us exists;
So we will follow jost what Plato thinks.""

Uprose; the morn was cold;
When on the road I met with one,
A piteous tale who told.
""Oh! traveller, she has left me here,
In this strange, lone countrie;
I've hunted for her far and near;
Aught of her did you see?""
""Say, was she winsome, young, and fair,
With eyes bright, deep, and sad;
And had she tresses of dark hair?""—
He said, ""My word, she had.""
""Say, was she like the fragrant morn,
In lovely, youthful glow;
Swan neck, and head so proudly borne?""—
""You're on—she was, just so.""
""Go, seek her in some lordly hall,
Or high baronial pile;
Where silken sheen and diamond gleam
Are bright as beauty's smile.
""Or, seek her in some cloister gray,
Within whose ancient walls
She may have haply fled away
From festive sports and balls.
""Or, in some garden's peaceful shade,
'Neath linden foliage green;
But errant maid in woodland glade
I really have not seen.
""Still, of my sympathy have share,
For your sad woes and trouble.""

Prodigious dampness, cramm'd with slimy fish,
Th* abode of gods and nymphs who love to swish
Their scaly tails, and lash to billowy wave.
The mass of mobile matter ! Th' unfill'd grave
Of men, and dead sea monsters, dear to science.
The poets' theme when, having placed reliance
On woman's faith, they seek for simile,
And nature points to the ever-varying sea ;
While women say 'tis boundless as their love !
Alas! too true ; for, soaring high above
Man's single love, th' ambitious female soul
Divides itself 'mong dozens,.yet remaining whole!

FAINT NOT!
[By M. Burkinshaw.]
Faint not! The hills of heaven are far away,
But lower ranges show their glimmering grey,
The dawn has gone, but there is still the day --
Faint not!
Faint not! The day draws closer to the night,
The limbs are weary and the cheek is white.
Faint not, but struggle while there yet is light.
Faint not!
Faint not! The castle gate ye sought to gain
Looms ever distant through the falling rain —
Ye yet can couch upon the grassy plain.
Faint not!
Faint not because ye lost a dearer prize.
Ah me! the witchery of those lips and eyes —
Faint not, possession never satisfies —
Faint not!
Faint not! but clench the hands and hush
the cries;
If you must fall, let it be but to rise.

Morning sparkle on sea and shore,
Skies that wait for the rising moon,
Park-lights glowing, and how much more--
All are set to a plaintive tune.
Something whispers ""She is not here;""
Something sighs ""She is still away;""
And I am missing my dearest dear
Night and day.
Sea we gloried in, blue and gold,
Lonely cliffs that we wandered on,
All lie now like a story told--

LOVE AND FAME UNTASTED.
H.A. BIRKBECK.
HOPE is the halo that radiates around
My sable-curtained views of human sound:
Undistinguished from others but by name,
Unknown and undadvised for so long aim
At fruits that Fame in this wide world contains,
And which, when joined to Love, swell out their worth
Into a bliss—an lien on this earth !—
A bliss towards which all extend their hands;
Attained by few, in dazzling height it stands '
To awe the fools, but animate the wise;
To shade the dull: to light the great uprise!
For, though immense the height, the poetic Muse
Sends her soft charms for the aspirant's use;
Aids them to climb the wild—the seeming waste,
Yet sues a tribute bending to her taste ;
And as its merits, so in height 'twill soar.
To dazzle future ages evermore.
Immortal recompense by her bestowed,
Yet she appears to dunces but a void
Statue veiled in mystery—devoid
Of aught attractive to ideal wastes.
Who can descry no portals to foretaste
The poetic sweets, and they perforce abstain
From what they're fated never to obtain.
Yet, as I say, great minds shall break the seal,
So that the gleams of her lustre may deal
Her touching pathos through their natural will;
That the reflective music of their souls
May get variety—what Love extols.
Thus, foot by foot, and step by step ascend
The sacred paths that lead to Love and Fun*
When found to dwell within the genial flame.
As to pure Peri, Eden now extends
Infinite bliss and pleasures without end.
Where she eternal sees the light of all
That in ecstatical joys dissolves the soul!
Can we be blamed for seeking Love and Fame ?
Tbe noblest means by which to build a name;
Assimilate, and more to perpetuate
To glorious bliss that angels above, elate,
And nappy beyond measure, evermore
Enjoy. Immortal spirits beyond compare
An much above all mortals in their bliss:
They live in strictest concord, sweetest peace,
By aught sublunar incorruptible;
To Glory, Joy, and Love susceptible!
But mortals' fame is that on earth which lights
Men through their gloom to the bright sinecure;
Where, wreathed in similes, they think themselves se
cure
From visitations which this world'abound.
Till Fortune's partial trumpet 'gain resound.
And hurl them from their pinnacle of bliss ;
From their bright halo to a dark abyss.
We, like Egyptian locusts, when they're bent
Past hills, and dales, and rivers' wide extent •
One upon the others heaped, till by excess
As countless myriads they attain access
Beyond the roaring floods though myriads drowned.
Victims to form the pontifical mound;
Yet more unscathed cross over to the plains
Of rich luxuriance caused by remote rains,—
So strive we men, enticed by glory's call,
To stem the torrent and attain our goal;
And though unnumbered sink beneath its well,
Hundreds attain of Love and Fame, the vale.
Our risk U great, yet glory's stern command
Is greater still, permitting no remand
By the sweet impetus of ladies' eyes,—
And what were Fame without fair maiden's sighs;
For maidens' sighs are liove, and Fame is Love.
To have one without the other, were to have

Ik thb Stocks.—The sulky, treacherous
temper defies calculation. All at once a cloud
comes over the face. You hare unwittingly
touched some tore, and he Bulks. There is no
honest anger, no blaze, but the coals are alight
in the mine, and generally you must wait till
they are burned out. You can't get at the
hidden heat. It smoulders on; all work is
stopped, though the outside looks much the
same as usual. I remember a horse-dealer who
always cared a fault by indulging it. He had
once a brute sent to him which occasionally
sulked and stood still. Farmer Waistcoat had
flogged him, and he would not more for an hour.
Well, this man took the beast, pat him in his
break, and drove off. In ten minutes he came to
a dead stand. Breaker said nothing, did nothing.
Horse didn't quite know what to reply, tried to
look back with his ears, waited half an hour, and
then began to move on. ""No, my friend,""
said the breaker; "" you stay here all day."" The
farmers passed him, going to market, with un
complimentary greetings. "" What, can't you
make a move!"" Breaker doeßn't look put out,
though. Tck! Farmers drive on, show their
samples, dine at the ordinary, and jog home a
trifle merrier, late in the afternoon. Breaker
still there, master of the 'position. At last he
jogged home, victorious. The horse never
stopped again, except on legitimate orthodox
occasions. So may we sometimes treat human
temper, and give the sulky something to sulk
about.— People's Magazine for August.
Thb Lawd op Boss Trass.—ln May the
soil is twice turned up, divided into squares,
and slips are then planted in holes at a distance
of 2£ feet. The slips are covered with earth,
which is kept constantly humid till the trees
appear above ground, when the irrigation is
lessened and the trees reach their natural
height of about 2} feet. At the end of Decem
ber the shoots are cut at the surface of the
ground, irrigation being recommenced for thirty
to forty days, being the time necessary for the
budding and blowing of the flower. The roses
are gathered every morning before sunrise,
while covered with dew; they are placed in an
alembic ere they dry or heat, and the distilla
tion lasts six hours. The water is white when
drawn from the alembic; that offered for sale
is generally yellowed by a mixture of water
from roses which have been infused. A feddan
gives from six to seven quintals of roses. In
1832,800 quintals were collected. By a reduc
tion of 50 per cent.-from distillation, these 800
quintals give 400, which produced 40,000 rot
toli of rose-water. A feddan planted with rose
trees costs 60 piastres for culture and taxes, and
gives three quintals, which give 300 rottoli,
which, at three piastres, produce 900 piastres
net. But no person is allowed to distil roses
for his own account, and those who cultivate
them are obliged to sell them to the Govern
ment. "" The manufacture of rose-water, for
which the Fayoum was so distinguished, is re
duced to very small results. There are a few
acres of rose garden in the neighborhood of the
capital (Medineh el Fayoum), but their pro*
duoe is trifling. The monoply of rose leaves,
for which so small a sum is allowed to the cul
tivators, has rendered the cultivation by no
means worth the attention of the peasantry or
landholders. It is seldom that any cultivator
has more than a single feddan dedicated to the
production of rose trees. The price paid for
rose leaves is 25 piastres =» ss. per cantar. Of
fine rose-water a small quantity is made for the
use of the Government; bat that produced for
sale is of little value and indifferent character.
There are three qualities of rose-water produced ;
they sell for 3 piastres (7*d.), 5 piastres (Is.
id.), and 7 piastres (Is. sjd.) per bottle. Otto
of roses is not manufactured in the Fayoum,
though the free cultivation of ro.e trees would,
I am assured, enable its inhabitants to oompeto
with any part of the East in ita production.
The consequence of the monopoly is the gradual

HAPPINESS.
TRIO.
OH, happiness, thou phantom shape,
Wilt ever tantalise, escape
Our grasp, cherished, eagerly sought,
Our strivings mock, dreams end in nought,
In life's gay morn, when bright is hope,
Dreams of pleasure visions ope,
To charm too oft with Biren voice,
To taunt and mock us for our choice.
Go seek it in the festive hall-
There mirth and glee 'a on faces all;
Its votaries erewhile confess
Such vain indulgence doubtful bliss.
Let wealth the chief est meed be deem'd,
And high above aught else esteem'd;
Riches create not happiness,
Bat they too oft with cares oppress.
Would you the trump of fame still sound,
Echo your name the world around,
For deeds of glory, high renown,
Valour, genius, may proudly own,
If patriot's fire burn in thy breast,
Then proudly don the warrior's crest;
.Richest of guerdons, crown of bays,
A people's thanks, a country's praise.
But if instead thou seekst a name
To pamper vanity, covet fame,
To live on lips, not in the heart-
Go win a bauble, thy desert.
He's happy who relieves from woe,
The oppressor's iron rule lays low;
High-sounding praise does not regard,
Bat finds in other's joy reward.
Ouonr op thb Tzkk "" Humbug.""—When
Solomon, condescending to take part in the
exetobes of the schools, delivered hinuelf of a
Latin speech in tit. Mary's Church, he was
"" Mfficiently applauded by the scholars by clap
ping of hands and humming, which, though
strange to him at first hearing,"" says Wood,
""yetwhen he understood, upon inquiry, what
that noise meant (which they told him signified
applause), was very well content."" From the
inarticulate-fbrttery of such ""hammers,"" as
those, who hummed James the First into good
contentment with himself, came the familiar
term of ""humbug"" and the signification
put upon "" to hum"" when the expression means
to "" impose upon by insincere praise.""—"" Annals

Ixhobtai. Flowers.—The snow-drop has
long been regarded as a saored flower, as the
first sign of the returning life of nature, piercing
the snow [French, perceneige). It was conse
crated to the Virgin Mary. On her Ascension
day, formerly, her images were removed from
the altars to in icate her ascension, and the spot
where each stood strewn with snow-drops. The
gnaphalium (amaranthon, the helichrysum of
Pliny, aad the chryeantbemon which Dioscorides
describes as used for chaplets), whioh we know
under so many common names—cat's foot, chas
tity, everlasting—has long had a connection with
immortality in Catholic countries, and is
gathered on Asoension-day to be hung over the
door of house and stable as a charm against
various evils, but especially lightning. It was
this flower that Emerson laid on the grave of
Thoreau. "" There is,"" he said, a flower known
to botanists, one of the same genus with our
summer plant called ' life* everlasting,' a gnapha
lium, like that, which grows on the most inac
cessible cliffs of the Trrolese Mountains, where
the chamois dare hardly venture, and which the
hunter, tempted by its beauty and his love (for
it is immensely valued by the Swiss maidens),
climbs the cliffs to gather, and is sometimes
found dead at the foot with the flower in his
hand. It is called by the botanists Onaphalium
leontopodium, bat by the Swiss JEdeltoeisse,
whioh signifies nobic purity. Tuoreau Beamed
to me to be living iv the hope to gather this
plant, which belonged to him of right."" The
superstitious value placed on it by the Swiss is
for wreaths, which are made on Ascension-day,
and said to have power under certain conditions
to render the wearer invisible. It is also an old
Suabian belief that one who on the Friday of
the full moon, or on a fete day before sunset,
pulls it up by the root, and folding it carefully
in a white cloth, wears it against the naked
breast, will thereby be made bullet-proof and
dagger proof.—'• The Sacred Flora"" in Harper's

Casada is moving for a grand and radical re
form in her educational system. A bill is now

history, chemistry and agriculture, and to es

Lines Written by Night.
E. COLWELL.
ABOVE my head from polo to pole
A vast oxpanse of liquid blue,
The starlit heavens meet luy view,
But bring no comfort to my soul.
But bring a sense of lonclinesss;
Ah! would that one wore here to toll
In whispers low, the magic spell
Such evenings work on my distress—
The spell that works with dire effect
Would then not harm, but heal, my woe;
The wind would sing In whispers low
Sons wafted home—not husbands wreokt.
But since I stand on alion land,
Lonely in heart, though not alone,
Tho winds will murmur and make moan
Of corpses washed upon tho strand.
The curlew Bhrioka from out tho night
Liko Bomo poor spirit racked with pain,
Or ghost for ever doomed in vain
To follow still a lying light.
The wild dog, howling in tho waste.
Culls to a ghoulish feast his mate;
Now, night seems black with lust and hate,
Which once I loved as puro and chaste.
I hear no music of the spheres
As I was wont at eventide
When Btanding, friend, by thy dear sido
""In summer months of vanished years.'
The Btare wore orst the beacons clear
That angels lit, to show whero lay
Through pits and snares tho narrow way,
When I was lost in doubt^ind fear.
But now—they seem cold pitiless eyes
That watch mo flounder in the mire,
That mock me as I faint and tire,
Or, falling, strive in vain to rise.
Tho meteors that shot through spaco
I deemed as ministers of light
Sent down to guide us through the night;
Thoy now hiss <TWrath,"" not whisper ""Grace.""
And I, who breathed out to my friend
My soul, boneath the starry wain,
Seem but a speck on some vast plain
That knows no boundary and no end.
And if across the waste I call
To friends ton thousand miles away—
Whose day's my night, whose night my day-
Strange on my ears the weird sounds fall.
My voice goes wandering through the night
Liko some lost soiil that seeks a homo,
Through many a long week it must roam
Before an answer brings delight.
And yet, sometimes I hoar a voico
Such as I heard in earlier youth,
And know it Is a voice of truth,
That Bpoaks from heaven, and crios ""Rejoice!""
That crieß "" Rejoice,""—that ""Courage"" cries;
""Faint not, nor linger by tho way;
If long tho night, the coming day
Shall last through all eternities.
""And in that day that cometh soon
The truth shall stand out clear and bright.
Not scon by glimpses, by the light
Of flickering star or pallid moon.
""Alono, when God is by thy side!

IN NINETEEN THIRTY-FOUR.
I noticed changes here and there in
nineteen thirty-four,
And some I've lined and rfiymed oft
fairly pat, .
While other things, I noted, went just
as they were before; ?
And now I've got a start, well, that
is that.
I. noted mofriets had to park upon tne
? common road,
While people quite as common, every
bit,
Monopolised verandahed space, except
when mot'rists mowed
Them down, and suffered dreadfully.
for it.
I noticed coppers sleek and tat. but
none with faces lined;
Though some, I'm sure, are loaded
well with care
That couldn't very well be stowed else
where but on the mind;
Vet few have any space to spare Jii
there.
Inoticed politicians with some anxious,
worried looks;
Though all their fronts were putfeu
and coming out.
Maybe they found the cushions leathered
' now from moulting chooks,
Who do not rting cast plumage round
about.
I did not notice churchmen on the dole,
or on relief
(I wouldn't knock one back were he
in need) —
But all their faces sported almost every
thing but grief,
And none came in to me to bum a
feed.
I didn't notice any time in nineteen
thirty-four
That truth got any sort of decent
spin;
In fact I often wonder what truth's for,
it is so raw ;
Unless to harden folks thin in the
skin
I noticed through one nine three four
my funds were fairly low,
And friends were prettv often on the
bite,
But I bite them, not nicely, but as
bluntly as 1 know,
And most of them have learned to
come to light.
And that reminds me — 'credit,' that so
very useful thing,
Is now a haloed, economic creed.
Yes, mine has changed from actual fact
to, theory t that's the stirig.
A very strange coincidence, indeed.

Jack Hayes.
BY HENRY KENDALL.
FAR back by a forested gap
Is the bend of a river of rills
That lies like a moon in the lap
Of a land at the feet of the hills—
In » home of the leaf and the blid,
He passes his nights and hii days,
As quiet aa water* unstirred—
Boio low, for I ting of Jack Hayet!
Bow low, and bt reverent now!
This crippled old loan that you im,
As white aa a wintering bough,
ii one of the angels to he.
At the clo»e of a beautiful life
It is meet that his name should be known,
Whose oouscienee is more than a wife—
Who dares to be righteous alone.
Away where the fftoe of the harsh
Wild mountain looks out of the fog,
Beyond n black furlong of marsh,
Is the hut of old Jack and his dog.
Twelrt) winter* of thundor and four
Have beateu tho bark of it thin;
But the blowing of Qod evermore
Remains with the hermit within.
The rafters are rotting away,
And bitter winds travel across
The roof with whose sorrowful gray
Is mingled the green of the moss.
In a wildernesß desolate—deep,
The ruined hut shakes in the blast;
Bnt peace is with Jack in his sleep,
And ho sticks to his home to the last
Lot only a buahman is Hayes,
Unable to read or to write;
But truth ia in all that he says,
And his heart U as pure as tho light.
A knowledge direct from Abovo
Has given him wisdom indeed,
A spirit illumined with love
And the child's irreproachable creed.
Just forty-five summer* ago
He landed in shame and in ohains;
But a soul that is fairer than snow
Is all of the "" lag"" that remains.
There is none of ns here who can oast
A stone of rebuke at his head:
He haa hidden the sin of the past
In the light of the life he has led.
He lias loved like the rest, and has lost
gome darlings he sorrows for now;
But a glory of hair like the frost
Beams over a passionless brow.
A cripple these twenty years past-
One maimed in the arm and the leg-
He works in the woods to the last
For the bread that he never will beg.
Karrare, the beautiful brook,
The daughter of fountains aloof,
Flows evermore down by the nook—
By the grove over Jack and his roof.
Where the psalm of the stream and the reeds
Make holy wild places untrod,
He, crowned by immaculate deeds,
Bits patiently waiting for God.",The Queenslander ,"850,485,320,353,354,454,497,545,553,533,478,543,472,562,493,403,476,674,622,509,532,570,529,540,570,522,532,523,457,477,567,518,488,566,557,587,480,432,499,577,502,484,449,575,448,553,553,509,592,685,530,528,618,547,514,482,560,597,532,580,465,512,575,568,711,477,551,480",Sat 15 Jan 1881,"293,600,724,805,850,877,912,943,978,1013,1046,1079,1137,1172,1202,1238,1271,1304,1339,1372,1428,1460,1496,1526,1564,1597,1633,1665,1723,1756,1787,1822,1855,1888,1923,1956,2013,2047,2082,2112,2148,2181,2216,2247,2306,2337,2372,2405,2439,2472,2506,2539,2594,2630,2663,2698,2734,2764,2798,2831,2888,2921,2956,2989,3020,3057,3090,3124","392,551,646,628,534,491,461,491,458,491,457,490,455,490,457,493,457,493,460,494,457,493,458,494,457,494,457,493,458,493,457,496,460,493,457,493,457,493,457,494,457,491,455,493,455,493,455,494,455,493,458,496,458,494,460,494,458,496,460,494,458,493,458,498,460,493,460,493",20704514,Page 73

And Fritz has laid the hammer down,
And Hans has left the vine:
As foolish babes they turned their feet
And the piper, on before,
Has played them up the village street
From the homes they'll see no more.

That follow the piper loon.
And many a lad must pay the fee

I.
WHEN winds to rest are sinking, love,
And flowers the dew-fall drinking, love,
My thoughts to thee
For ever flee,
Round thy bower a charm'd ring linking, love!
There they speed like the shaft to its mark, my fair,
At the meeting of light and dark, my fair,
At the lover's day-dawn,
When the moon's on the lawn,
And the nightingale sings for the lark, my fair!
II.
When not a wave is foaming, love,
And nought but Passion roaming, love,
Let thy thoughts with mine
In memory twine,
At the soft sweet hour of gloaming, love!
Think of me when the bright stars lave, my fair,
And dance in the stream they pave, my fair,
As if every star
Had shot from afar,
To hold a ball on the wave, my fair!
III.
While all in beauty's shining, love,
And all at rest reclining, love,
Remember him
Whose heart is dim,
In the midst of peace repining, love!
And when in thy bower to heaven, my fair,
Thy spirit at night is given, my fair,
Let thy pure thoughts rise
To their kindred skies,
In a prayer for the heart thou hast riven, my fair!

THE HEALER.
You have sinned against the printed God,
The God prim-fashioned by priestly hands;
You have wept salt tears, have spurned the rod;
But the great Earth Mother understands.
Go to the trees! and the wind-swept places,
Press the green grass to your care-lined faces;
There is balm in breaths of the whisp'ring breeze,
There is healing sure in the songs of trees!
I know, for I too, have walked the city
With pleading eyes and a yearning heart.
Bet never a face grew soft with pity,
They hustled me in the dusty mart,
With curved and clutching finger-tips,
The greed of gold on their tight-drawn lips.
But go to the hills-to the lonely places—
To the cool, dark scrubs and the wind-swept spaces!
You are near to the God of the Untrod Ways,
The God who plans as no nan-God planned,
Who is never hungry far spoken praise,
Nor gold dealt out with a grudging hand.
The hills are here—when the churches crumble —
A silent prayer, be it e'er humble,
Goes straight to God from the lonely places,
From the contrite hearts and tear-wet faces!

To Miss R. M. O. N.;
- IRELAND.
Tue Arab maid her native bowers
Will love where'er she roam,
Her bright Gazettes, her flagrant flowers,
Her Yemen's sunny home.
The perfume from those valleys dear,
Each gentle breeze will bear;
And every lovely object near,
Recall a fairer there.
Well may that orient clime command
Its children's love sincere,
And if less bright - our own green land-
Our Erin's not less dear!
For absent sunshine, native wit
Will gild our winter's gloom-
For costly gems we've Genius bright
Adorning Valour's tomb.
For spciy groves, we've minds all pure,
Hearts - guileless, faithful, fond;
Ah Asia hath no sweets, I'm sure,
Our own "" home-ties"" beyond.
The Exile from Hibernia's shore
Of every thing most fair,
Will form a likeness to restore
All that she worshipped there.

are constantly occurring (says the Deniliquin
Chronicle) showing the inconveniences which are
created to the selector himself through the
operation of selection before surrey. Some two
years since a selector, named G. W. Middlemiss,
took up forty acres on the Tumudgerie run, in
the neighborhood of Deniliquin ; be settled on
"" some"" land, built his house, enclosed a por
tion, cultivated the ground, and brought the
produce into the town and disposed of it; he is
well known, his name has been for years on the
jury list, and in his turn ho has been served
with summonses at his residence on the ground
by the officials of our Courts. At last the sur
veyor arrived to adjust the descriptions the
selector had given by his more correct method,
and found that the former had described a por
tion of land other than that occupied. That, in
fact, the selector had described one piece of land
and lived on and occupied another. In obedienco
to the new light the selector removes his house,
and months paBS on with their improvements,
and then comes a letter from the Lands Depart
ment stating it has reason to believe that he has
not fulfilled the residence clause in respect to
the land he had selected, and inquiring what
reason he can allege for its non-forfeiture ? Wo
are not awaro whethor the case is complicated
by any one asserting a claim to the land which
has actually been occupied; but wo shall not be
surprised that it is so—it would only present a
muddle which is so apt to occur, either from
accident or design. It must, hoirever, be
evident that, maugre the incorrectness of the
description, the- selector has acted in perfect
good fnith and within the meaning of the Act
with regard to residence, and that the land in
tended to be selected, however erroneously de
scribed, is that which has been occupied and
cultivated. No Executive that desired to inter
pret the Act with honesty, either to tho com
munity or to the private citizen would, we
inmgine, seek to oust a selector under such cir
cunntance?.",The Queenslander ,"509,170,655,551,649,408,664,446,659,491,652,368,663,345,771,498,684,556,487,515,690,407,863,914,908,913,910,914,910,915,895,914,910,915,918,912,894,908,914,895,910,914,912,913,913,887,909,908,910,911,909,912,906,906,908,907,907,907,903,888,883,904,885,879,904,885,222",Sat 29 Feb 1868,"5831,6850,5887,5928,5972,6016,6083,6124,6167,6214,6277,6323,6365,6411,6474,6518,6562,6606,6669,6715,6759,6803,6951,7009,7063,7120,7175,7230,7285,7339,7394,7449,7506,7559,7614,7666,7709,7753,7798,7841,7885,7929,7973,8017,8061,8107,8151,8194,8239,8285,8329,8372,8416,8460,8502,8548,8592,8636,8679,8723,8767,8811,8855,8899,8940,8984,9036","6227,6720,6123,6162,6123,6164,6120,6159,6120,6161,6120,6164,6120,6164,6123,6164,6120,6164,6120,6164,6126,6164,6074,6031,6035,6030,6031,6030,6030,6030,6030,6030,6030,6030,6027,6030,6031,6031,6031,6031,6033,6031,6030,6031,6030,6031,6031,6031,6031,6031,6033,6031,6038,6035,6035,6035,6035,6035,6035,6035,6035,6036,6036,6036,6035,6036,6035",20317606,Page 7

England is mine, and I am England's own!
All that is best within me lives for her alone.
That which is base and vile I spurn from me
Lest she with her unsleeping eyes should see,
And me condemn. She bore me in her womb
Where wild winds blew; and through the storm-
lashed gloom
Came ocean's boom.
And I was wove a living thread here strung
In the vast loom.
She was my mother mighty-voiced. I hung
Upon her breasts and greedy-mouthed did drink
Her noble sustenance. And on the brink
Of secret things I stood, when sweet and high
Her slumber songs lulled me to sleep, and I
Heard through their mounting cadence, wild and
free,
The low andante beating of a sea.
England is mine, and I am England's own!
I am a singing harp, and hers the hand alone
That plays the strings. Without, I am a thing,
Dead, dumb, inanimate. So shall I sing!
Here at the door-way of her room I keep
A ceaseless watch, untouched by straying sleep --
Dream shadowed, deep.
A living flame of fire from out its sheath
My sword shall leap,
If I should hear her proud soul moan beneath
A weight of woe. My voice shall beat the stars
And thund'ring shake the might of Heaven's bars
Till earth's dark caverns echo with the cry: --
""Here, mother, mighty-souled, O England, I
Am here to serve! Born of the wind and sea

Among"" the tall white lilies by laugh-
ing waterfalls;
Where the charm and wondrous beauty
of each untroubled day
Seem to leave a mellow languor
within the temple walls,
Is found my sanctuary.
For sometimes I can hear the sound
of Shantung lutes,
Or the song of the Shen-yin tree
grows clear in the moonlit nights;
And mignonette and violets wreathe
the flutes
That sing of Shanghai days and
dreamy Honan sights,
Within my sanctuary.
Within the walls come whispers from
the outside ways of men,
But now they cannot take away my
happiness,
Though memories are thronging swift
-of moor and fen,
Of lake and river, coral isles in love-

To me in sanctuary.
But'here a gentle music playing weaves
a spell
Of magic greater far than Life's wide
wand'ring ways;
I ask but to stay until the weary mind
is well,
And then I'll take the beauty,
through the crowded days,
Of my dear sanctuary.

TO A FRIEND IN THE MOTHER COUNTRY.
MY friend, in hours of thought and care,
In evening hours of holy musing,
When converse sweet we wont to share,
Thy words the balm of peace infusing,
No more I meet thy smile of love,
I gaze around my little room,
And start to hear thy footstep move,
As it was gently wont to come.
In vain--in different paths we tread--
And thou no more mayest soothe or cheer,
Yet have those hours of friendship shed,
A sweetness that still lingers here.
And many a deep and holy thought
And high resolve shall breathe of thee,
And hours of toil and duties fraught,
Shall consecrate thy memory.
And when I breathe the voice of praise,
Or tune the lighter lay of gladness--
Or when the fainting prayer I raise
In the dark hours of pain and sadness.
In joy--in grief thy image still,
Shall beam in brightness on my way,
My soul with holier faith to fill,
And guide me to a happier day.
Then not in vain I've seen those scenes,
Though distance does our love divide;
Though the dark ocean intervenes
And time and change our fates betide.
Yet life in all its varying lot,
Of bliss or suffering, will not view
The hour when thou wilt be forgot,
Or friendship's prayer arise less true.

There are no eyes but sleep.

question tho clergyman replied, "" Perhaps they took
no physic.""
The customers of a cooper in the Highlands caused
him a great deal of vexation by their saving habits
and persistency in getting their tubs and casks re
paired, buying very little now work. ""I stood it long
enough, however,'' said he, "" until ono day old M'Caw
brie brought in an old bung-hole, to which ho said ho
wanted a new barrel made. Then I quitted tho North
in disgust.""
A dog was accidentally present during divino servieo
in a Scotch kirk, where the worthy minister was in tho
habit of speaking very loud in the sermon, and, in fact,
when he got warmed with his subject, of shouting
almost to tho top of his voice. Tho dog, who hi the
early part had been very quiet, became quite excited,
ns is not uncommon with somo dogs when hearing a
noise ; and from whining and whining, as tho speaker's
voice rose loud and strong, at last began to bark and
howl. Tho minister naturally much annoyed at the
interruption, called upon tho beadle to put out tho dog ;
and ho at once expressed his readiness to obey the
order, but could not resist thc temptutation to look up
to tho pulpit, and to say, very significantly ""Ay, ay,
Sir ; but indoed it was yoursel' began it.""
Snooks had occasion to call on the reverend Dominie
Thomas Atrachard while he was at Glasgow. "" Is the
dominie in ?"" ho inquired of a portly dame who opened
the door. "" He's at hame, but ho's no in,"" replied the
lady. "" Ho's in tho yard, sooperintendin' Sauncrs, tho
carpenter. You can sec him the noo if your business
I is vera precise."" Snooks assented, and walked through
I thc door pointed out to him into the yard, where ho
; boheld a carpenter briskly planing a joint, to thc air of
Maggie Lauder, and the worthy dominic standing by.
Unwilling to intrude on their conversation, Snooks
stepped, unseen, behind a water cask, and heard :
""Sauners !"" No answer from the carpenter. ""Sauners !
I say. Can you hear me ?"" "" Yes, miuister, I hear ye.
What's your wull?"" ""Can ye no whistle some muir
solemn and godly tune while ye're at work ?"" ""A-wcel,
minister, if it bc your wull, I'll e'en do it."" Upon which
lie changed the air to Hie Dead March in Saul, greatly
to thc hinderanco of what was now painful planing. Thc
dominie looked on somo minutes in silence, nnd then
said, "" Sauncrs. I hue anithcr word to say till ye. Did
the gudowifc hire ye by tho day's darg or by thc job ?""
""Tho day's darg was our agreeing, maister."" ""Then,
on tho whole, Sauuers, I think yo maun justas wcel gae
back to whistling bonnie Moggie Lauder.""",Australian Town and Country Journal ,"288,134,643,685,592,619,715,646,669,571,529,708,619,655,746,666,706,730,735,540,722,694,666,593,635,607,595,565,599,696,617,638,541,662,549,621,713,814,509,547,593,631,676,604,620,639,955,929,139,923,76,930,103,925,122,927,686,924,965,754,924,967,902,932,969,967,781,919,959,957,968,564,938,973,972,971,974,527,922,973,974,971,960,975,972,192,933,975,962,975,960,975,970,198,934,970,971,972,972,970,971,972,974,974,974,975,973,974,711,931,971,973,975,971,973,994,992,991,973,974,973,971,972,974,971,972,981,971,969,968,970,966,969,729",Sat 8 Jan 1876,"535,633,677,713,749,787,858,895,931,968,1040,1078,1113,1150,1223,1259,1295,1332,1405,1443,1478,1515,1588,1625,1661,1698,1771,1809,1845,1882,1955,1992,2029,2067,2140,2177,2212,2250,2322,2359,2395,2432,2498,2536,2572,2608,2647,2741,2778,2814,2852,2887,2924,2957,2997,3034,3070,3107,3143,3180,3226,3262,3298,3345,3381,3417,3453,3499,3535,3571,3608,3644,3690,3727,3763,3799,3836,3872,3919,3955,3992,4028,4064,4099,4137,4173,4220,4255,4292,4327,4364,4401,4437,4474,4519,4555,4591,4627,4664,4700,4737,4773,4808,4844,4881,4917,4954,4990,5025,5073,5108,5144,5181,5217,5255,5283,5326,5363,5399,5435,5472,5507,5545,5580,5616,5651,5688,5726,5761,5798,5833,5869,5905,5941","3637,3718,3371,3408,3371,3407,3367,3407,3369,3407,3370,3408,3372,3408,3371,3410,3372,3411,3374,3414,3374,3412,3375,3414,3376,3414,3376,3415,3375,3415,3382,3416,3380,3416,3378,3414,3376,3417,3378,3415,3378,3414,3382,3414,3374,3412,3271,3335,3297,3338,3298,3337,3298,3339,3303,3341,3303,3342,3304,3304,3345,3304,3303,3340,3302,3302,3300,3338,3298,3299,3299,3296,3336,3296,3296,3295,3294,3295,3332,3294,3295,3294,3294,3294,3294,3294,3335,3293,3292,3293,3293,3292,3293,3292,3331,3292,3290,3291,3290,3291,3290,3290,3289,3289,3289,3289,3290,3289,3290,3330,3291,3290,3288,3289,3289,3269,3270,3269,3289,3289,3288,3288,3289,3287,3289,3287,3279,3288,3288,3289,3288,3288,3287,3288",70588006,Page 25

The Psalm of Time.
In our childhood's roveroat reading of the ancien
Hook of Book?),
How wo pictured Abraham watching o'er hi
flookH by Syria's brook«,
And our fancy fondly lingered iu that past ou
soul rovoieB,
When man's life was nursed by nature inti
patriarchal years :
Whon the field, the forge, the study, claimed n>
life-exhausting toil,
And the sons of men lived simply-from thi
kindly-natured soil.
Growing hore a grove of dato palms, garnering
theie a litt lo grain,
. Faring frugal, sleeping soundly, living lives thal
laughed at pain.
Strong and active, tough and tireless, opei
hearted kindly souled,
Such as poets love to picture iu the far off ago 01
gold -
When the rainbow-pinioned seraphs fount
another heaven on earth,'
As they lived aud loved enraptured with theil
brides of mortal birch.
Lo ! with earliest dewy morning, see the shep
herd-king arise,
Shaking slumber from his eyelids, gazing on the
brightening skies,
Where the fading stars shine fainter, as the
jewelled robo of night
Glides from off^orcation'a shoulders, blushing
with tho kira of light.
His, the glorious tabernacle, whonce hi3 prayers
could freely risc
All tho mountains for his altar ! -for his templo,
all the skies !
Where the wandering winds of Heaven cadenced
every song of praise,
And, with God's cathedral round him, all his
week was Sabbath days.
Thou, the human heart was reverent I for
mankind believed its creeds :
Now the ancient faiths wail feebly, lest a
younger ono sucoeeds.
But true faith can never altor-born on high
and teaching good
Which behoves in God the Father, and Christ's
human brotherhood.
As the clouds which darken Heaven burst in
storms to clear its skies,
Sci forms change, but Faith survives them-for
- Religion never dies !
Though tho oity's toil-worn worker, shut from
Nature's hnalthior sod.
Feels tho squalid suffering round Mm almost shako bis
faith iu God !
For his presout seems so dreary, with its weary gas-lit
toil,
Whilst his soul and body sicken, shut from earth's free
air aud soil.
Woe the hurry ! woo tho worry ! woo tho selfish, strug
gling strife :
Which this bastard cultivation foroos on our doily life.
Woo the long bard hours of labour, making e'en it«
thought abhorred,
Where the master fears his servant, and tho servani
hates his lord.
Seo tho drunkard ! see tho outoast ! soe the pauper
soe the gaol !
Hoar tho work-worn weakly murmur-does not civiliza
tion fail?
No ! with earnest tongue saya Wisdom-oven on eartl
God's justified
Wore the world to grow no bettor Christ had vainlj
lived and died !
Wiser sense shall mould man's labour to a handmaid
fair of health
Loftier faith and tonderer conscience bid him from his
hoarded wealth
Feed tho school to starve the prison-raze the hovel,
build tho home,'
Lighten labour, lift the lowly, teaoh the fallen hope to
come
Give to each his birthright, knowledge -wisdom follows,
which shall teach
Universal need of virtue, and tho equal rights of each ;
Showing all this truth-that trouble, pain and wrong,
and pestilence, .
Spring alone from vice olid folly-not from God's good
providence !
Tko dawn of brighter days is breaking slowly o'er life's
twilight sea,
Every earnest heart awaking to tho glories yofc to bo.
When its sunburst clnavos tho darkness which divides
man'B brotherhood,
Showing tho enlightened natious-"" to bo wiso ia to bc

Cultured man is man tho Christian ! seeking good and
shunning criino !
And, when Cb.rint.hui teaching triumphs, earth shall seo
its golden primo.
Mightier mimls than ours surround us, moulding all our
puny plans
To the wide world's larger welfare, thwarting oft tho
leanor man's.
Like tho ruin clouds drifting seaward, wasting freshness
o'or the main,
So full many a soul strong-purposod, scorns to livo its
lifo in vain.
But . as evory straggling sunbeam works God's will
through unknown space,
So niAti'o loneliest, scattered efforts, blend nt last to
help his rn co !
? Egypt's pyramids are trophies built by nameless slaves,
whoao lives
Aro. forgotten, yet not vainly died they whilst their
work survives 1
Shall I labour1, saith tho selfish, for a harvest not my
own ?
Saith tho nobler, I will do so : I or time will reap
what's novvn.
Therefore, fellow-workers, faint not, though tho ond wo
may not soo.
Every worthy thought or action helps to mould futu
rity.
For we'ro fathers of tba future, as wo'ro children of tho
past
Let us leavo this generation hotter thnn we found tho
last.
Yes, bo hopeful ! oh my brothers ! for tho storm pro
cedes tho shine,
Through tho clouds of darkness roll we on today-dawns

Seo tho cities of the futuro ! groves and gardens, domes
and towers,
Whore each homo's a freomnn's palace, graced with
pictures, fountains, flowers.
Where tho loftiest art makes lovely all life's lowliest
common needs,
And wiso soieuau, widoly-workinrr, from lifo'a refuse all
lifo feeds,
Theu tho world shall thrill with music, aa each day's ;

And the setting suns shine gladly over universal penoe.
That which has been may again be, and as knowledge
makes all wise,
Love shall change this ravaged Eden to a newer para
dise, i
Where Eve's daughters, truor-hearted, grown to perfect
womanhood,
Prove, that every outward beauty is reflooted inner
good.
I Lovely as are little ohildron in their infancy's first
yoarB,
Yet with childhood's growth thoy alter-beauty fades
or disappears
-For a season ! till, Uko sunrise, blushing through tho
morning skies,
Youth gains freshor charms and fairer-softer looks and
brighter oyes
Gathering graceful strength and figure, till tho soul
perfected form
Is as fairer than the infant's, as the butterfly its worm.
Lo I tho vineyard's purple cluster* burst with juices
cool and sweet
Crush them in the wine-press, soe them foam with
swelling froth and heat.
For a season, till tho earth-born particles are purified,
And the sun-born spirit sparkles-clearer than tho
vine's red tide.
So, tho curront of creation like an eddying river flows,
Though awhile tho stream may falter, yet it wider,
stronger grows.
E'en tho very stars of hoavon somotimes seem to back
ward stray,
Yet through countless ages each ono circles on ita cor

Wiser grows tho world and better, and tho growing
years shall find
That tho sonnons of the Saviour sway tho souls of all
mankind.
For the lowering love of luoro, oaauged shall grow to

And the commonwealth of nations-baptized to abettor

Scorning ' wrong, and selfish struggles, iu a rivalry of
good
Livo through long and golden ages, linked in loving

ARCHIBALD BIRT.
I came to my birth when the beautiful Earth
Awoke on a morning in May,
And I nodded the Moon and the Stars ""Good-night
As the dawn broke over the Bay.
I looked at tbe Sun rising over the sea.
And, as he wont high and moro high,
I wondered if he would look down at me
From his home in the fathomless sky.
And he saw me, and stooped, and pressed a warm kiss
On my heart as it surged with its love;
While I gloried to think that now 1 was hi.
Who ruled all the World from above.
But my petal oheeks blushed at the warmth of hit
touch,
And my sight for a moment went dim
As I thought of tho kiss which to me meant to much—
80 much, yet so little to him.
And I hang my bead as the great king sped
On his way, tflj he went to his rest;
And sadly I watched him descend to his bed
In tbe gold-burnished cloud, of tbe west.
But I saw him again, gleaming over the main.
As he warmed me once moro with tbe touch
Which to him meant so little, the thought cam. with
Sain—
tie 1 to me to much. -
Then there came a koea thrab shooting up to my
heart, . ■ * .
And I knew that asm again h
Would I hang on tbe tree bis beauty to see,
Tossed by th. broeze and bathed by the rain.
But now I am pressed to a fair woman's breast,
I can hear bar heart beating low,
And I feel her soft breath as I wait for my death-
Come qulckl sinoe it most be so,
But I am content, though my life is all spent,
My petal cheeks blush as I die.
My king's touch has blest me, fair hands have oarested
me;
I am dying away from God's sky,

PUNCH STAFF PAPERIS. A collection of tales, sketches,
'&c, in prose and verse, by the members of tho staff
of Sydney Punch. Gordon and Gotch.
Tho authors of this really handsome volume, believe
1 apparently in the motto that "" union is strength."" At
, any rate they have chosen to tempt their literary fate
. 'in company, and upon the whole a very goodly company
; thoy aro. Somo of thom ore men whose names as public
writers aro already familiar ; most of thom, we believe,
looking to their pons and their wit3 for a livelihood,
i Critics themselves, they invite criticism, and in common
courtesy to their professional position as men of letters
must oxpoct to be tried by a somewhat higher standard
1 than if merely so mauy literary neophytes.
PUNCH STAFF PAPERS is tho outcome of a band of
s literary brothers, who with a good deal to say for them
I selves havo hitherto had but small chanco of saying it.
. In their own words the literary man in Australia "" has
1 littlo or no opportunity of associating himself with his
work, und is thus in a great measure debarred from
attaining that notoriety which is the first step on tho
ladder of faino aud fortuno."" Tho complaint is no
doubt quite true, though whether the inability of
the local literary mau to identify himself with
1 his own work has always been to disadvantage
may possibly bo doubted. To bo appreciated of
course, ono mush bo known, but ifc by no means
follows that to bo known must always moan to bo ap
preciated. Begarding, however, this joint production
1 of their several unappreciated pons as au effort to
attain that important "" first stop,"" wo may say at onco
that if fame and fortune are to be reachod by a series of
such steps, the Punch staff may be congratulated on
their prospects. With so much varied ability at com
' maud, abundant ' brains, an accomplished artist, an
accommodating printer, and it is to bo hopod an ap
preciative public, there is no reason why a succossion
of similar handsome volumes should uot follow each
other with tho regularity of an English monthly, nnd
thus tho ladder be mounted and fame's tall templo
gained within, say, tho next twelvemonths. Wo are
ufrnid, though, that most of these plucky aspirants for
literary honour and reward have a longer way before
them. Tho/are clevor, no doubt, but they are also
somewhat crudo-gems, possibly, yet dostmcd to glitter
in tho front of Australia's literary diadem, but just now
decidedly in the rough, requiriug much patient cutting
and polishing befuro the needful lustre is likely to bo
developed. It will not do, however, as ono of the best
papors in tho book reminds us, to "" despise the day of
small things,"" and wo havo certainly no intention of
depreciating tho work of authors who if not a;l or any
of them geniuses, are at least tho nearest approach to
tho genuine article that tho country seems at pre
sent to possoss. The modesty indeed of the
writers - for nothing could well bo milder than
their protonsions, as set forth in tho unas
suming preface--should be itself sufficient protection
against anything like severity of criticism Not only is
their calling, tho production of light reading, defined as
a"" profitless pursuit,"" but tho book itself is described
ns only a fair snmple of tho "" average work"" of "" liter
ary hacke,"" poor and unappreciated because unknown.
Gentlemen who so characterise themselves and their labors
would deserve to be tenderly treated, even were there
far greater ground to treat them otherwise than the
very little there happily is. Thoy have at least done
their best to vindicate their position as local men of
letters, and have given tho public an excellent opportu
nity^ improving their taste, aud in the matter of ap
preciation of local talent, mending their ways, which we
shall bo delighted to hear has been as largely used as it
certainly deserves to be.
Perhaps the first thing to strike a reader of tho new
book as somewhat remarkable will be that, tho produc
tion of professed Punch writers, thero should be in it
so vei-y litttlo Punch. Of humour, indeed, there is abund
ance, but of tho witty play of fan and fancy, the jokes
and the gibes that one is apt to associate with tho laugh
ing philosopher of tho hump, thero is little enough""
Perhaps the authors were anxious to show that though
Punch contributors, they were something more than
mero jokers, in which case their success ? has certainly
been complete. _ Perhaps "" fun and fancy"" are expensivo
items scarcoly included in tho average work of a local
"" literary hack."" We must except, however, in this
case tho charming verses of Mr. M'Crae, of Melbourne
entitled tho Aubergo, whero thero is certainly plenty
of both. Such linea as these are far above tho "" average
work"" of the rhymesters who do duty in our local
literature aa poets :
THE AUBERG-«.
SouvEian OF NORMANDS.-.
I love a tavern old, wherein
To.pass a night or so-no sin,
Altho""tis pleasant
And drink, enjoying well-earned ease.
Before I taste my Switzer cheese.
Macon with pheasant 1
.Por mn the brilliant bougies burn,
To mo the omelette comes in turn
With brandy blazing!
Whilst on the hearth 'twe«n iron dogs,
Roars up the ruddy fire of log«.
With glow amazing !
In snob a cosy nook can I
Tile world and time aud care defy,
And eat my penr;
And quaff my Ohab'lis while I think
Of Austral vintages and drink
My petit verre 1
The softest, blandest, eau dc vie,
Whose warmth soon enters into me
My heart to soften ;
And cafe noir in tiny sips,
As the cigar forsakes my lips
Slow and not often. ,
j Thero is some fun, too, of the practical joke order, in
I Mr. Moser's well told story of the Budgeree School Con
cert, and there ia a good deal of capital fun and fancy
too, in Mr. Grosvenor Bunster's grotesque yarn of
"" Kai Tamaruo and the Devil."" Maigre a few unplea
sant mannerisms, Mr. Bunster is an excellent atory
teller. If hjs humour is occasionally a little rough, it
is always hearty and genuine, and if his style sometimes
moro than verges upon the vulgar it is generally fresh
and vigorous as a breeze at Manly But he should avoid
sentiment and sweet-hearts, whether of ""long ago"" or of
yesterday, and especially aweet-hearts in verse.
Women aro "" kittle-cattle"" nlwaya, but an old flame that
won't go out, bnt on the contrary grows stronger and
stronger still, '""as yearby year doth pass away,"" must be
a nuisance for a gentleman to carry about with him,
especially if involving tho necessity of au occasional tri
buto of verso to the memory of old kisses. Mr. Bunster's
verses to his "" Sweet-heart long ago"" are as good as that
sort of thing usually is when middle-aired gentlemen get
into such a sentimental f ramo of mind as suggests such
profound reflections ns these : -
Por if life's cares and changes mark
Their stern prints on tho fae«, />'
Tho loving heart is armour proof
Against Time's swiftest race.
« And e'en when old, as day by day, *
Weall of us must grow,
Iiotnembrance keeps ns youthful yet
My sweet-heart long ugo.
He is moro at home when the sentimental mood lias
passed away, and ho gets back into thc moro congenial
atmosphere of a "" Roundabout Paper,"" and slashes
roundly the prevailing fashion of the period-cant.
That he doesn't mince matters maybe judged from the
following, which ia also a fair specimen of his literary
style :
The church I spoke of is a most beautiful edifice. It is fur
I nished most comfortably. In hot weather it is as cool as a
cellar, in cold weather it is carefully warmed. I should say
that soma thousands of pounds have been spent on it. Wor
ship in sucha church must be really a luxury But how to
get away from this ? The money spent upon this und other
I ohurehc'3 might have saved many a poor wretch from death or
I crime; reared manya youngster in worldly respectability.
It. strikes me that tho founder of Christianity did not ask for
! such luxurious churches. Ho was content with God's ohurch
-the hill-tops, the woods, tho mountain-side, the plain, were
his cathedrals; thu smile of nature, the green {award, the fra
grant flowers, the Atting furniture. And when at his ieet
thero gathered the rich and poor, tho rugs of the one were as
proper in his sight as the rich robes of the other. Ask an ill
dressed man or woman why they don't go to church nnd the
answer is, in tho trne servility ot cant, "" I'm too shabby.""
And the ministers and their congregations endorse this cant,
so that it coinés to pass if a poor dovil can never raiso a good
coat to worship in lie stands a fair chinee of damnation. All
because of tho c""at ! It ia wonderfuljhow those, small matters
tull on our destinies.
If this sounds to people with good coats a little
like the reasoning of Bohemia-well, wo suppose tho
writer would say, that is cunt agnin. Mr. Harold Ste
phen is, wo believe, a late acquisition to the Sydney press
and ho promises to bo a good one. Nothing bettor inuits
way has been published boro for years than his amusing
burlesque legetid of Prague, Hans Von Schloffonbachs,
and ono is left to wonder why a writer who can bo so
funny in prose should think it worth bia whilo to be so
funereal in verso. His blank verse effort ""My Dream""
is certainly ti powerful productioutjiu one sense, but
it is not .a pleasant sense. Tho nightmare is no doubt
a sutiieiontly disagreeable experience, but if afflicted
with it the last thing a really humano mun would think
of doiucr would bo to try to give it to other people
ThiH one lapse into something very liko bathos is tho
more to be regretted as most of Mr. Stephen's other
poetical productions are airy and graceful enough.
Blank vorse, however, seems to bo rather a favourito
exorcise with the Punch staff, no less than four of tho
contributors having tried their hands at it, ono of them
in two placea. In "" Basil Moss."" Mr. Henry Kendall
recounts with terrible reality, tho struggles of aman of
genius caught iu tho grip.of tho demon Iutemperauce :
A story shining with a woman's love ! .
Ami who that knows that love can ever donbe
How dear, divine, sublime a thing lt Is;
Po'- while the talo of Basil Mass was one
Not oluokfiied with those stark, witauio sins
Which call tor superhuman sacrifiée,

ThTo's nota depth to which a man can fall.
No slough of crime in which such one can lie.
Stoned with the scorn ai.d curses of hie kind,
Hut that Hoiwo tender woman can bo found
To love and shield him still.
Unfortunately for tho poor women, very often, that is toe
true; but Mr. Kendall makes his touching talo of Basil
Moss"" end happily with the reformation of tho drunken
gonius and the assurance : -
That Love, that sweet »uthentio messenger
Prom God, «an never fail while there is lett

I am cold and tired, mother,
And I feel so strange to-night;
Something hurt* me hen, dear mother,
Like a atone upon my brewt;
Oh, I wonder, wonder, mother,
Why it is I cannot rest.

How the kind and bleaaed Jesu*
Lores His lambs to watch and keep ;
And I wished He'd come and take me
In His arms, that I might sleep.
Just before the lamp was lighted,
Just before the children came,
While the room was very quiet,
I heard someone call my name.
And at once the window ojiened :
In a field where lambs and sheep—
Borne from ont a brjok were drinking,
Some were lying fast asleep.
Bnt I could not see the Savionr, •
Though I strained my eyes to see ;
.And I wondered if He saw me,
Would He »]>eak to such as me?

Come up here, my little Bessie
Come up here uinl live with me,
Where the children never suffer.
But are happier than you see!""

The Farewell Business.—An old man up in
Connecticut had a poor cranky bit of a wife,
who regularly once a week got up in the night
and invited the family to see her die. She gave
away her things, spoke her last words, made her
peace with heaven, and then about 8 she got up
in the usual way and disappointed everybody by
going at her household duties as if nothing had
happened. The oK man got sick of it finally, '
and went out and got a coffin, a real nice cash
mere shroud, a wreath of immortelles with
"" Farewell, Mary Ann,"" worked in, and a hand
ful of silver-plated screws. Laying the screw
driver beside the collection, he invited her to
just holler "" die"" once more. ""Do it,"" said he,
"" and in you go, and this farewell business is
over."" Mary Ann is at this moment baking
buckwheat cakes for a large and admiring
family, while they dry apples in the coffin up in
the garret
Theue is a Connecticut widower who declares

GENTLEMEN,-At tho insUcco of an influential
deputation of electois, 1 beg to announce myself a can-
didate for your suffrages at the approaching tkctieo.
Identified with tho colony at large, and having a
personal stake in its prosperity and welfare, 1 feel that
I may with some confidence lay claim to your Bupport,
provided my political views aro in accordance with
those of the constituency.
1 avow myself a warm supporter of the Publie
Schools Act, conceiving that tho Ministry that intro
duced it and the Aesetnlly that | neted it uro enti ltd
to the especial thanks of tho community for thc gt. ut
benefits it has conferred oa the people cf th« colony.
The question of State-aid 1 look up n as finally
settled it; a manner equit-iblo and just to'll parties
ooneerned and my vote ihitll never ba given to re-open
any discussion referring thereto.
KotrenohmeHt I regard an a question nf ergent im-
portance tu the present condition of our rimmers, but
one must bo token that in making reductions we do
not impair th» efficiency of tho public sorvioe.
I shall have suoh frequent opportunities of meeting
you during my canvass, ana of expounding my views
on various other subjeets on which you may desire to
be informed, that I am unsolved from the necessity of
extending my prisent «ddress.

you, I lind that there aro two Candidates for your
suffrages - one onerpotically supported hythe late, and
the other by the present Government; and as I am
not a party man I am unwilling to contest against an
influence so powerful as either. Therefore, and ucoauao
it is tho general belief that a dissolution of Parliament
will soon take pla:o, I have determined to withdraw
from tho content. Thanking you for the many offen
of support which have been kindly tendered.
I am. Gentlemen, your obedient servant,
A. H. M CULLOCH.

HILIP M'CARROLL, PITT-STREET.
M'OABROLL'S not been long in getting in supplies,
To stop both beef and mutton making any further
rise ;
It waa very hard on people for many, weeks non post,
But seo tho prices blown b.-lovr-ho's brought them
down at last.
Tho timos are' bad enough ; men working at a trade
Find labour v.-ty hatd to get, and then but poorly piid.
The rate of -wages ruling now, foed ought at least be
ohesp,
A pair of honda must find it hard a family to keep.
M'OARBOLL always does his best in every way he
can
To smooth the road that lies before tho honest labour
¡ag man;
This week: he's lowered the prices, they'll all be glad to
Lee,
Nor is there one amongst thom that feels more glad
than he.
What is there can be.better, or what caji do more good,
Than keeping down the prices of a leading thing of
food T
It choers tho heart of labonr, makes mind and bod;
?trong,
With plenty beef a man oan work, he finds no day toe
long.
In this M'OABROLL'S done his part through mun;
years-of trade.
Tho' well he knows by doing so the enemies he made.

The Mountain Splitter.
He works in the glen where the waratah grows,
And the gums and the ashes are tall,
'Neath cliffs that re-echo the sound of his blows
When the wedges leap in from the mall.
He comes of a hardy old immigrant race ;
And he feels not the rain or the ""drouth.""
His sinews are tougher than wire ; and his face
Has been tann'd by the sun of the south.
Now doom'd to be shorn of its glory at last
Is the stately old tree he attacks ;
Its moments of life he is numbering fast
With the keen steady strokes of his axe.
Loud cracks at the butt ; and the strong wood is
burst ;
And the splitter steps backward, and turns
His eyes to the boughs that move slowly at first
Ere they rush to their grave in the ferns.
He strips off the bark with slight effort of strength
And stretches it out on the weeds,
And marks off the trunk with a measure the length
Of the rails or the palings he needs.
The teeth of his crosscut so truly are set
That it swings from his elbow at ease ;
And the song of the saw — I am hearing it yet —
Has the music of wind in the trees.
Strong blows on the wedge, and a rip and a tear,
And the log opens up to the butt ;
And, spreading around thro' the pure mountain air,
Is the scent of the wood newly cut.
A lover of comfort and cronies is he ;
And when the day's work is behind,
A fire, and a yarn, and pint of good tea,
At the hut of the splitter you'll find.
His custom is sought in the town by the range ;
For well to the future he looks :
His cheques in an instant the storekeepers change ;
And his name is the best on the books.

O! do not think because I smile,
My bosom's free from sorrow,
The flower that blows to day, awhile,
May wither e'er to morrow.
The brightest joys that life adorn,
May feel misfortune's hour;
And e'en the blushes of the morn,
Be followed with a shower.
The bud of hope may blossom fair,
But blighted droop and languish;
And pleasure's eye grow dim with care
And love be lost in anguish.

Make ye cages and not nets,
Ladies, ladies;
To keep, not win, weave amulets,
Ladies.
For, when youv'e caught the wayward bird
With sweeter look and honey'd word,
Forget not then each playful wile,
Nor careless dress, nor careless smile,
Or you will lose him,
Ladies.
Make ye cages and not nets,
Ladies, ladies;
The fondest heart sometimes forgets
Ladies.
Have ye not varied ways to charm him,
Or loving words and means to calm him,
Soon, soon your bird will wing the air
And find a bosom kind elsewhere
Will try to keep him,
Ladies.
Make ye cages and not nets,
Ladies, ladies,
And save a world of vain regrets.
Ladies.
For let but once the cord decay,
Be ever dull from day to day,
Be all the wife, the mistress none.
Be never as you first begun,
Youv'e cut the fetters,
Ladies.
Make ye cages and not nets,
Ladies, ladies;
Love's sun 'mid clouds too often sets.
Ladies.
Hope's dawn uplifts its joyous head,
And life looks all one flower bed;
There floats one little cloud above.
The heaven of your early love,
Which tells a tempest,
Ladies.
Make ye cages and not nets,
Ladies, ladies;
Affection claims in full its debts
Ladies.
The sweetest Paradise which blooms
Is home enriched by Truth's perfumes :
O ! never let the serpent breath
Of doubting chill its charm to death-—
'Twill no more blossom,
Ladies.
Make ye cages and not nets,
Ladies, ladies;
Too oft your charming ways are jets
Ladies,
Which, like the trees the fountain throws,
Fall earthward while it brighest glows;
Be proud to win a manly heart
Be prouder of that nobler part,
To try and keep it,
Ladies.
Make ye cages and not nets,
Ladies, ladies;
The tether'd bird for ever frets,
Ladies!
Sweets; then be kind, be varied, gay,
Nor smile, nor sigh, nor weep alway;
Put not your wish, to please asleep,
And you the wildest bird will keep,
And never lose him,

A GLIMPSE oi? ENGLAND AMID AUSTRALIAN HILLS.
Amid the range tliat nears the southern coast
Bodalla lies-a smiling valley green
So green that to home-loving eyes it seems
E'en like n quiet dream of England, hid
And nestled in the wild Australian hills.
There gleam tho still blue lake and winding stream.
The golden corn-fields and the sunny slope ;
While here and there are cottage homes and farms,
With browsing herds in clover pastures fed ;
And furrowed land o'er which the plough has passed,
In winter readiness for English seed
That here unconscious of an allen soil,
With old-world freshness still will spring and grow.
The very air of all this peaceful land
Is soft and still, for sheltering mountains rise
And, glooming blue and dark with varying shade,
Shut out the blighting winds, that restless blow
Yet cannot pass the tree-clad ramparts high ;
While all the moisture steaming from the earth
Held in, though rising, turns to dewy mist
And veils th' enclosing hills in sweet revenge.
Thus softly soothing all their rugged lines,
Deep'ning their shadows-adding richer glow.
And through alluvial flats tho Tuross winds.
At first a serpentining silver stream.
But widening with blue waters to the sea,
And overhung by blossoming wattles green ;
Or like a liquid pathway glancing broad
Between a solemn avenue of oaks
Swamp-oaks, with fibrous fir-like leaves that droop
Till dark reflections quiver in the deeps.
And thro' whoso cords the gentlest wind will sigh
With soft /Eolian sounds that lull the soul,
Yet stir its depths with longings vague and sweet.
A happy vale 1 that any man might love
To call his own and cherish to his heart !
See, in the midst, upon a rising slope
Beneath the shelter of the Bumbo Mount,
There gleams the homestead-gabled cottage white
With creeping vines and garden flowers bright ;
Wliile on one side stand gold-brown stacks of hay.
The dairy and surroundings of tho farm.
The clustering village of thc workers' homes,
The quick steam-engine and the blacksmith's forge.
Then in tile front, o'er mignonetted beds.
The eye looks on a meadow rich and broad.
Its glistening tints in double greenness shown
And thrown out by tho fringing ranges dark ;
While round tho holds the bending river flows
And almost makes an island of tho spot
Whicn seems so English-like, that wc could look
And half believe ourselves again at home.
Or think this were a memory taking form,
A reminiscence sweet, or waking dream !
Ah Comerang 1 shall I picturo thee at morn ?
While still the valley sleeps in robe of mist.
And lowing cows of varied hue and form
Thro' frosty fields are driven to the sheds
Where childish milkmaids, rosy-faced und bright,
""With skillful hands press out tile creamy milk.
Or shall I paint thee in the golden hues
Of evening light?- which e'er the sun has set,
Hoods all the fields with tinted radiance soft
And glances bright through lengthening shadows deep;
While in tho west the purpling mountains glow,
Or faintly redden with a parting blush
As day's king, ling'rlng o er his last good night,
Illumes tho heights o'er which his glory sinks.
Nay, there is still a sweeter, holier time 1
The sacred stillness of the Sunday morn,
When all the sounds of industry have ceased.
And labour's garments for a while put off,
The people answer to the echoing bell
That calls them to the work of prayer and praise.
Now, like a family gathered in tile hull
The homestead hall with church-like hangings deokt,
They listen to the words, and pray the prayers
That thousand brethren e'en aro lifting up
In distant churches, at the selfsame hour ;
And music sweet, and joyous hymns resound
In men's deep bass, and children's voices high
Rising, thro' country air so pure and shrill,,
To the Great Father of the fruitful earth, '

A CONSTANT READER.
AMSTERDAM.*
Written at Sea, January 31, 1830,
LONELY isle in solitude,
'Mid the ocean dark and rude;
Far from scenes of care and strife,
Busy world and earthly life;
Reft in some far ancient age,
By volcanic's fiery rage,
From the dark recess of waves,
(?) the hapless seamen's graves,
(?) then been rolling on
(?) when time begun.
Now with crag and lava graced,
Mantling o'er a barren waste,
Still a sterile spot appears,
Lonely as in former years;
Rudely decked with stony rock,
Proudly daring ocean's shock,
Should its fiercest tempests dare
All the strength of ocean war:
Now secure it safely stands
Far away from other lands,
(?) by its clayey red
(?) in wat'ry bed,
Where the sounding wild waves foam,
There was erst its olden home.
(?) on the crater's edge,
Now the sea-dash'd precipice,
Tells of former fiery days,
When the ocean-land in blaze
Was a bright and burning pile,
Not a sea, and scarce an isle;
Now the sea bird builds its nest,
Safe in solitude and rest,
In the rugged cliffs afar
From human reach in lofty scaur;
There its young secure are bred,
There its offspring safely fed,
Screaming their wild notes to the air,
They dwell in lone security there.
When the soul is ill at ease,
When delights all fail to please,
When the strength and power of art
Fail a solace to impart
To the wretched bleeding heart;
Then this lone and stilly place,
Destitute of every grace,
Would be hail'd as welcome spot
For the solitary's lot;
Where, secure from ill of man,
He could measure out his span,
Worshipping his Maker, far
From the din of worldly jar;
Still improving in the ways,
Thus his mighty Master please,
Then from earth to pass away,
Stilly, to the realms of day,
Bidding life a glad farewell,
Calm'd by high Religion's spell.
Lonely isle! I ne'er again
Shall view thee from the foaming main;
Ne'er climb thy rocks, or sea-fowl chase
Back to their rocky nestling place;
A stranger thro' the world I roam,
Without a resting place or home.
Far from thy cliffy sides the last
Remains of life will soon be past;
Yet the firm hopes of future bliss,
In bright abodes of happiness,
Do well atone for every strife,
And toil and care that darken life.

MY HARP.
In Imitation of the 1st Ode of Anacreon.
I SEIZED my harp, and changed each chord,
And vowed no more to sing of love;
I swept me o'er the strings and board,
And sounded Nature, War, and Jove;
But all I did, the truth to tell,
Was bound by some romantic spell.
I sung how Nature clothes the year
With flowers, and fruits, and swelling grain;
How burdened fields the peasants cheer,
And load the master's purse with gain;
How bursting cobs salute the eye,
And tell that harvest home's are nigh.
I sung how o'er each verdant field
The stately stalks their fruits supply;
How vallies richest pastures yield,
And deep in clover oxen lie:--
'Tis vain--no pleasing ditty flows;
I sound my theme in rounded prose.
I sung how peaches, pears, and vines,
Their fruits present most sweet to see;
Loquets, and limes, and nectarines,
And quinces load each bending tree:--
'Tis ail all in vain, for high or low ,
Or long or short, no numbers flow.
I changed my theme, and called to mind
The scenes of home, to wake my strain;
The falling stream, the scented wind,
The gurgling rill, the jocund plain,
The snowy cliffs, and misty isle,
Where groves, and towers, and turrets smile.
I swept the chords with wond'rous might,
And sounded floods, and rains, and hail,
When milkmaids crowd the fire by night,
And frozen milk bring home in pail:--
Of such, alas! 'tis vain to sing,
For love still sounds from every string.
I changed my strings, and trimmed my harp,
Resolved to sing of deeds of blood,
And words most sounding, fierce, and sharp,
Rolled from my tongue like rolling flood:
Of gun, drum, trumpet, pistol, pike,
I sung,--as none e'er heard the like:
But when I saw the crimson tide
Had dyed my hands with purple gore,
I said, ""Such scenes I can't abide,
And will not--for a year,--or more.""
""No, no!"" said I, ""if you do please,
""I'll bid good bye to scenes like these.""
Once more I changed each sounding string,
And all my craft and skill applied,
And strove Minerva's praise to sing,
Her wisdom, and heroic pride;
Of Juno, too, I sung the praise,
And lived,--on Ceres,--many days.
Of Mars in awe I always stood,
His nodding plumes were not for me:
I knew he dealt in deeds of blood,
To friend and foe--or bond or free;
I always kept beyond his spear,
And thus my heart felt kindred fear.
Of Mercury, I fairly own,
I never touched my sounding lyre;
The rogues, with hearts as hard as stone,
That follow him, I don't admire;
For every sober man believes
That he, and they are--rogues and thieves.
Of him who wears the lion's skin,
Whose strength no mortal man can slay,
Whose club might serve as rolling pin
For Brobdignagian lads to play,
But who--oh shame to hearts of steel!--
Sat down,--and turned a spinning wheel!
--Of him who fiends and monsters smote,
And travelled earth's remotest bounds;
Now clothed in cap and petticoat,
Now covered o'er with scars and wounds:
--Of him, I say, I strove to sing,
But not a sound flew from the string.
At higher game my numbers flew;
I tried to sing of Father Jove,
But when his acts came in review,
I found them only acts of--love .
Alas! Alas! I'll snap the chord--
And break the keys--and burn the board,
""But first,"" says I, ""let's sing awhile
""Of Venus, and her rosy son;
""One may at least an hour beguile,
""And, when 'tis past, then I am done:
""I feel my heart as mute and chill
""As marble bust or icy hill.""
I swept the chords,--my fingers flew
O'er every string with force and fire;
""Why this,"" says I, ""to me is new,
""But this is just what I desire.
""Let Nature, War, and Father Jove,
""Succumb to Venus, Grace, and Love.""
But sure if these in one unite,
As they in Y------- do,
It must give more than pure delight
To sing of her and Venus too:
For shape, and youth, and form, and air,
And soul, denote perfection there.
Well; since the kindred fates decree
A destiny so far above
The one that Nature formed for me,
I'll teach my harp the songs of love:
If others blame my voice, why then--

STANZAS.
Dear Henry, forbear to complain
That my Muse so much singeth of Love,
Since ever employed in like strain
Are the fire-winged Seraphs above.
In Freedom's high praises, aloft
I will soar-I will thunder at Wrong !
But still let me sweeten more oft
With the manna of Beauty my song.
And what is there under the skies
So complete for the voice of the Muse,
When gracious, as beautiful eyes,
And young cheeks with their rosiate hues ?
And lips that as twin cherries smile,
Breathing balm like an Indian Spring ;
And all these expressive the while
Of the exquisite Spirit I sing?
And though these should fade, being crost,
Then the more our remembrance should claim,
The love-dreaming Girl that was lost
In the measureless strength of her flame.
Then never again disapprove
Of the passionate Lay ! Were it wrong,
Would the Stars sing together of love,
And the Angels rejoice in their song?
XXXVII.
THE TERRORS OF BEAUTY.
Thy fairy feet, thy sylphic waist,
And those twin innocents, as they
Fill up like doves whose nestward haste
Had flurried them ; those lips that play
Apart so clovenly and rich;
Those pinky cheeks, and, thou sweet Witch,
Those eyes the loveliest in the world,
And that fair forehead overcurled
With tresses in their darkness bright,
Like darkness of a starry night;
All fill me with such sweet dismay,
That still, for looking though the more
In love,-for Love I've less to say

Resignation.
Kb ; I care not for gladness-I have Been my god of
day,
Which-a fool and in my folly-I had thought would
shine for aye,
On a fool and on his folly I had thought for aye would

T have seen its downward passage, leaving me and
leaving mino;
And I've known the awful terror at the fading of the
light,
Known the utter, utter blackness at the coming of
the night.
Nay ! mine eyes are used to darkness ; they would
illy bear the day ;
Leave me in my realm of shadows, where at length
I've used to stay.
Long and dreary was the pathway leading to this

Notes for town and Country
pur ON POLE BY TANTALUS. ^
IT is very irritating to the rußhlights oE our
Assembly that thosV newspaper fellows should
distinctly make statements of political impor
tance before they (tht rushlights) become awaro
of the facts. There ii that visit of our versatile
Premier to Amerioa anl the old country, for in
stance. It was pretty well known last week that
Sir Henry was going-that the doctors who keep
a run of his physical system told him he must go, or
risk the consequences, that he has become
literally used up with the nagging and worry of
political life; and that, to make the most of the
stamina still in him, a long trip by sea, new
scenes, and complete severance from tho grind to
which he has been subjected, were recommended.
The Premier took tho advice offered. Be saw its
force, and determined to go. That there might be
less chance of drawing back, a passage was taken
in the Californian mail steamer sailing on
tho 29th. Sir Henry, "" therefore, will
just, .hare tluoo to spend Christmas at
horne hore in the colony, see tho Christmas issue
of the TOWN AND COTJNTRT (which, I am told, will
he something unusual), and then off for his holi
day. Peace be with him. T expect we will get
along very well in his absence, for it is surprising
how men glide into holding the helm of the State,
and hold it very well too. I hope he'll have a good
time, and if ho don't come back, that he may be
able to get that seat in tho greater House
at Westminster whioh it is rumoured he is
hankering after. It was said in last week's Notes
he was going, and if hon. members desire to
verify the situation, instead of wasting time in
Parliament, a «all in at the office of the Pacific
Mail Co. will enlighten them (if that's what they
want). Tnere's a list there of the passengers
booked for the outgoing boat, and the name of
Sir Henry Parkes is amongst the lot.
"" Tips"" are not much in my way, but tho most
beautiful thing of the kind I ever got has been
spoiled. Here have I been labouring away at a
Note concerning tho visit of the Premier to Eng
land (after doing America). That same Note is
before me, and it winds up with the startling dis
closure that the main object of that visit was to
select Bix of the perfect order of god-like mortals
described during the dobates on tho Sydney
Magistrates' Bill as being of tho ealibre suit
able to sit and dispense justice in the
Sydney police courts. But it's all off
now, as the Bportfl say. I hadn't an
idea, you see, that there sat around, or lay
spread out on the Assembly honchos during
Monday night, the full number of incipient can
didates who considered themselves fit and cap
able persons to fill tho billets in question. And
that sticking out of tho coat pockets, or depos
ited in the drawers of other hon. members were
letters and testimonials from three times as
many aspirants lor those police magistrateships
as there are chairs to fill. When to that con
tingent is added two or three aspiring members
of the Upper House, who believe they could
still do their country service-for ¿800 a
yoar-and quito a crowd of outsiders whoBO
ambition has boen fired l y the eloquent descrip
tions of model police magistrates, there is no
occasion whatever for tho Premier to beat up tho
elite of England for right and proper persons.
That's where tho point of my Noto is blunted. It
is almost startling to find we have such numbers
of high-toned mortals amongst us who are flowing
over with tho sorb of wisdom whioh henceforth is
(that is, soon as provision for paying tho screw
is made) to decorate the magisterial honchos of
Sydney. I thought every one of thoso wonderful
beings described by tho Government would have
to bo imported, and all my lamentation that we
had no such mon amongst ourselvos is labour lost.
Tho mon aro hero, and eager to commonco opera
tions, and draw tho paltry salary immortalised in
tho pages of "" Hansard "" by tho eloquent mem
ber for Shoalhaven.

Not a succeBB. Mr. Cameron's efforts'bf that kind

Thero\eing something in the form of a cruelty
to animaiKorganisation in this colony of ours, for
goodness slte j.et them overhaul the cattle carried
in our railwy* trucks. Until I saw those dena of
cruel torture\the belief was on me that it was
more humanoNp aend cattle by rail than travel
them from, sayWellington. But a trip over the
Sahara, with d&th by the way, would bo luxury
for bullooks in comparison with a voyage in those
truckB. They're frightful, and very much in keep
ing with our railwayÑrrangements generally. The
said tracks are not wio^enough for grown bullocks,
to start with, and af tex a journey of 100 miles or
less the tortured occupants ore found to be
barked all . round the ruup and tail j the head
and knees als > present masses and patches oE raw
.kin. So muoh for cattle who are able to hold
out upon their legs during a journey.' If they go
down, and many do, the other occupants of the
car crowd upon or trample them. It is horribly
cruel, and I should like to see some of those who
are responsible arrested and made to pay the
penalty of cruelty to animals. Constitu
tional government enables. a majority to do
as they can manag9 with minorities. But
deliberate torture and injury to the carcasses of
cattle are not covered by the constitution. There's
aohance for the eruelty to animals society to go
in and do a genuine service, and improve the
cattle cars.
As explained nicely by the following letter,
"" BaokBlock"" thinks that there are bank clerks
who do manage to koop honest on JB200 a year.
Being of precisely the same belief, space for his
letter is mado with pleasure :
Tbat was a rory fair ont Ly you at tho twaddle indulgod
ia regarding1 tho stinginess ol bank directors in paying
low salaries to tboir dorks. The faofc is they would
bavo twioo as many as tboy can próvido stools for at
nothing at all per annum, Tho honour and (flory of
having Augustus, or Harry, or ÏTred, or some other of tho

tho poor lads iu tho way of temptation in order to be

faoo the manly but roughor occupations opon to

thousands of honost bank dorks who do not got mora,
and many of thom loss, than £200 a year. But wbnt do

Bendigo, Victoria, May, 1896.
I saw of late ono running hero and ihorc
About the wor d, who beat his breast and cried,
""O God,.art Thou dethroned, and dost Thou hide,
All impotent, in his infernal lair, . - ';
Who now, meseenifl, Thy Godhood seeks to wear
And Thy jnst laws in scorn to override,
Bestowing pain where joy should moat abide,
And cursing Innocence with Hell's despair?""
Then saw I later one of ordered mien,
With meekest dignity he passed along,
And said (as to a friend at bis right hand),
""Foolish my cries, who ne'er of p»in had seen. .
The heart divine,—o Lord, forgive the wrong!
Now have I suffered, and now understand.""",The Queenslander ,"1013,395,479,160,820,682,795,837,757,817,661,754,758,636,646,705,879,776,730",Sat 25 Jul 1896,"452,894,769,1461,1485,975,1011,1046,1077,1110,1143,1175,1208,1241,1274,1307,1342,1375,1408","293,661,622,1112,452,414,449,452,416,416,450,449,414,416,450,416,417,450,417",20450439,Page 161

A LOVING VOICE.
L.N.
ACROSS the seething and forging sea
Comes a loving voice from a distant land;
Sounding as clear and as sweet to me
As heavenly hymn of the seraph band.
It stirs my soul to its inmost depth,
With its gentle, tender, and pleading tone;
Breathing fond wishes from those I left
In the dear old land and the olden home.
It calms the wild spirit with soft words,
Fraught with the memories of long ago ;
like sweetest warbUngs of happy birds,
la leafy wood, or 'neath the green hedgerow.
Bids the lone heart be patient and true.
Looking to the future with hope and faith:
To bear the burden aa right to do,
Cheerfolr/, bravely, not -dnUof beneath.
O loving voice from that distant shore,
I hail thy advent with joyous delight;
Brighten my path, and I fear no more
The clouds and shadows that darken my sight.
Oome still to comfort me, welcome voioe;
Speed o'er the wide sea on thy swiftest wing;
Gladden my ear, bid my heart rejoice

A New Song to an Old Tune.
""O what a day !""— Tom Thumb.
Old travellers, folks say, who from here to there are dancing,
On foreign sights and novelties to satisfy their eyes,
When on their travels gain a passion, for romancing,
And gull their simple readers with a volumn full of lies.
But I, who never look'd upon the wonderfuls. of Italy,
Like roving lords cannot descant upon them all so wittily ;
So, 'stead of writing books about old Vulcan's naked daughter O,
I'll sing ot something wonderful, in stanza's that are shorter O.
Then, my neighbours then, with good humour in your faces, ,
Attend unto my rhyming, and don't treat it with a frown ;
I sing of no unworthy deeds, but of Sydney Races,
That late inspir'd, and boldly fir'd, our great equestrian town.
The morn scarce dawn'd 'fore each horse was buckled to the traces,
As glowing fancy bodied forth the glories of the day ;
The ladies drest, in all their best—in muslins and in laces,
And sweeter than Diana look'd when riding forth in may.
Now mounted high, in Stanhope gig, in Buggy, or in Dennet, O,
With elbows squared, each thriving lord low bows to neighbour
Bennett, O ;
And, as he looks behind, in pride to see what gables follow, O,
Thinks, himself, in driving skill, Phaeton or Apollo, O.
Master Catch'em led the van—in company with Simkins,
The antipodes of all that's just, mannerly, and good ;
Next mister Quiver trembling rides, while his neighbour Jenkins,
Kept the "" tenor of his way,"" just as steady as he could.
Now Captain Speedwell in his gig, with reins and whipcord la-
bours O,
"" I travel post,"" he laughing cries, and. dashes past his neigh-
bours, O ;
And sure enough he "" posted it,'' for 'midst his dashing paces O,
He runs against a gate and snaps his new-imported traces O.
Simon Trueheart ambling rides and amorously given,
Gallantly tries his ladylove with burning vows to please;
"" Constancy alone,"" he sighs, '' 'tis makes this earth a heaven,
And madam I'm devoutly yours, I'll swear upon my knees.""
Just then his Rosinante tripp'd, and 'midst the ladies squalling O
Beside-her frighted steed, he drops upon his trotters sprawling O
When she look'd down and leering cries, "" I'll meet you at the
steeple O.
But pray don't swear my doating swain before so many people O.?
The Race ground gained, that place of fun, the knavish world's
epitome,
Where jockeys jostle, honest men, who jostle too in scorn ;
Where men lay bare their secret thoughts, and skilful in anatomy.
Just try to bleed their trusting frie'nds, who try to bleed in turn.
Great Epsom Downs with all their show, their bon ton, their
horses O,
Newmarket too with all her dukes, her buckels and her crosses O ;
Could ne'er display so bright a day—that day light, full was
dawning O,
Upon the Course of Botany on a fine September morning O.
But to mention every one who rode with magnanimity,
Would take more, time and doggrel rhyme than I can now
afford ;
Knights there were that pois'd the lance, and Baronets of dignity,
And Lords that cut up Holland like old Iervis by the yard.
Some would quiet friends and foes by lecturing it and proctering ;
Others took a shorter cut, nnd so cut them off by doctoring ;
But just to make amends for this, they'd kindly the next mi-
nute O,
Repair the loss the world sustain'd by bringing others in it O.
Merchants gay with hawking men familiarly imbrangled ;
Sad plaintiffs and defendants too—the wise man and the fool ;
Tailors, tinkers, justice's together were entangled,
As if distinction now no more—equality's the rule.
Fun and mirth kept jubilee, with laughter and drollery ;
Every scene was leeling drunk with humour, wit, and drollery ;
As up and down the course, they drove, cantering and parading it,
You'd swore the court of momus was at Belle Vue—masquerad-
ing it.
Each heart agog for sporting fun with challenges vociferous ;
Five to four on this, and then with offers round they, go—
The mania spreads for sportsmen know that betting is petiforous,
And like a fever is not cured till patients are brought low.
Now dashing from the starting post they gallop and they sidle O
And quick as fancy jockeys spur and whip, and chafe the bridle O
In daring skill each rider seems precisely of a kidney O !
For neck or nothing—is nothing new to sporting blades of
Sydney O.
Now the races all gone through, each kindred horse of Dante's
Prancing turns his snorting nose towards the distant town—
But each tit that's cousin to, the the steed of old Cervante's,
Contented with his feather bed, in quiet lays him down,
midst the din of sporting noise, Inmcntingsnnd of praises O—
Rattling dash on the carts, the coaches, and the chaises O—
For every one drives home so fast, you'd think they had no
leisure O.
To stop and take another sup of quick receding pleasure O.
Now fill high the foaming glass and quickly as it passes,
Toast off success to racing joy's, those antidotes of woe ;
For what is man with all his cares, and what are pray the lasses,
If pleasure's sunshine never beams upon this life of snow ?
Shut out from sports the mind contracts woe seizes on the spirits O
And gloom profound, and hopeless care, man feels he but in-
herits O ;
But wearied hearts, whose blood is spent in sorrow's own em-
ployments O,
Will blithly meet the iron toil that follows on enjoyments O.

GEORGE VOWLES.
Ipswich.
A SOUND of music so stirs my soul
That it wakens the thoughts that had flown,
Till around me in visions the beautiful roll—<*>
My childhood's (air days and what fancy has known—
▲ breath of the rammer—m ray of the sun—
AH these from the put are most certainly won;
The spring-day of 700 th, when the dark eye was glisten-
The bright daw of courtship and love;
When affection tat near me and llatening.
Brought Heaven to earth from above.
Ah. Muic! thon bindert with fetten
_ The bosom to what is most tender;
Karth's dsniums are thy fond debtors.
To tbee precious time tbey rarrender.
when sorrow droops pensively on the warm breast,
And care and deceit hover ronnd with unrest; '
A* toe sun burning fiercely dispels the dense shades,
So contest thon, sweet, with such seal,
The heart, till then mournful, a rapture pervades,
And nothing but pleasure we feat
The tyrant may bind with his chains,
In a dungeon the strong may confine;
If a note of soft music his sorrow attains,
He thinks of his freedom and ceases to pine.
Thou art the repressor, oh Music! of wrongs;
The bosom exuftingly fires at thy songs.
Where misery lingers, where man is deplorin*,
Shouldst thou in thy richness oome there ■—
As the sky after storms when thunders ceased roaring,
All things that we see are most fair.
Thy tones have aroused in my bosom
A joy free descended from heaven;
£ess brilliant is dew on the blossom
Than eyes which sparkle for what thou hast given.
Oh, Music! if Eden be yet on the earth,
It delights and it gladdens when thou hast thy birth;
It scatters around me its trees and its flowers,
And leads me where Adam has trod;
I soar like the angels and ride on the hours,
To the home of Lord andGod.
Cuinrinoir to the mind is as necessary as
food is to the body.
Lbt this be thy brazen wall of defence—to
be conscious of no guilt, and not to turn pale
on any charge.— Horace.
It is a base temper in mankind that they will
not take the smallest slight at theshands of those
who have done them the greatest kindness.
Thx time we live ought not to be computed
by the number of years, but by the use that has
been made of that time beneficiently given us. \
Take heed of jesting; many have been ruined
by it. It is hard to jest and not sometimes jeer,
too; which oftentimes sinks deeper than was
intended, or expected.
Enjoy the blessings of this day if Godsends
them; and the evils bear patiently and serenely.
For this day only is ours; we are dead to yester
day, and we are not born to to-morrow.
When you see an old man amiable, mild, equ
able, content, and good-humoured, be sure that
in his youth he was iust, generous, and forbear
ing. Inbisend he does not lament the past nor
dread the future. He is like the evening of a
fine day.
Thx Ant.—The celebrated conqueror, Timour
the Tartar, was once forced to take shelter from
his enemies in a ruined building. There he sat
alone for ae/eraf hours. After tome time,
desirous of diverting his mind from bis hope
less condition, he fixed his attention on an ant,
which was attempting to carry a grain of corn
larger than itaelf up a high wall; its effort,
• however, were unsuccessful. Again and again
it strove to accomplish its object and failed,
still undaunted, it returned to its task, and
sixty-nine times did Timour see the grain fall to
the ground: but the seventieth time the ant
reached the top of the wall with the prise, and
"" the sight,"" said the conqueror, who had just
before been despairing, ""gave me courage at
the moment, and I have never forgotten the
lesson it conveyed."" Application. —Nor should
we forget it. We should first see if the tiling
it worth doing, and if it be, and we fail, we
should try again and again, and persevere until
it is accomplished.' If an ant was not dis
couraged by sixty-nine failures, why should
mankind be disheartened ?
Temptations.—'Scarcely anyone in the
Christian world at this day knows whence
temptations are. He who undergoes them be
lieves not otherwise than that they are torments
arising from the' evils which are inwardly with
man, and which first render him unquiet, next
anxious, and finally torment him; but he is al
together ignorant that they are effected by the
evU spirits which are with him; that he is
ignorant of this is because he does not believe
that he is in fellowship with spirits while he
live* in the world, and scaroely that there is any
spirit with him, when yet man, as to the in
teriors, is continually in the society of spirits and
angels. As to what concerns temptations, they
tab place when man is in the act of regenera
tion, for no one can be regenerated unless he
also undergoes temptations; and then they
exist by evil spirits who are about him; for
man is then let into the state of evil in which
he is, that is, in which is that which constitutes
his proprium, and when he comes into this
state, evil or infernal spirits encompass him, and
when they perceive that he is interiorly pro
tected by angels, the evil spirits excite the ideas
which he had thought, and the evils which he
had done, but the angels from the interior de
fend him. It is this combat which is perceived
by man as temptation, but so obscurely that he
scaroely knows otherwise than that it is merely
an anxiety; for man, especially he who believes
nothing concerning influx, is in a. state alto
gether obscure, and scaroely perceives a
thousaadeth part of those things concerning
which evil spirits and angels combat; never
theless, man and his eternal salvation
are then at stake, and the determination
of the stake is for man (ci agUmr ex
hominej for the combat is carried on from
those things which are with man and con
cerning them. Temptations also give the
quality of the perception of good and truth,
by the opposite* which evil spirits then infuse;
for no one knows what good is, unless he also'
knows what is not good; nor what truth is
unless he knows what is not true. Temptations
also confirm goods and truths, for man then
fights against evils and false*, and by conquer
ing he comes into a stronger affirmative. More
over, also, by temptations evils and falses are
subdued, that tbey may no longer attempt to
rise up; thus evils and wises are rejected to the
sides, whereas goods and truths are in the
midst, and according to the seal of affection are
elevated upwards, thus to heaven towards the
Lord, from whom is the elevation. Whosoever is
engaged in the combats of temptation, and con
quers in them, acquires to himself more and
more power over evil spirits, till at length they
dare not assault him. The Lord Himself im
mediately, and mediately by bis angels, is pre
sent with those who are in temptation, and re
sists, by refuting the falses of the infernal
spirits, and by dissipating their evil, whence
comes refreshment, hope, and victory; thus the
brother of faith and the goods of charity are
more inwardly implanted and more strongly
oonfirmed. This is the means whereby spiritual
life is bestowed.— Old Author.
To Cubs a Felon.—A correspondent says:
When indications of a felon appear, take a piece
of rennet and soak it in warm milk until it be
comes soft, then apply it to the part affected,
renewing it occasionally, and keeping on until a
cure is produced.
To Kill Wartb. —The following is said never
to fail, if properly applied : Make a strong steep,
from red oak bark, in hot water; when cold,
apply as convenient, the oftener the better. In
a few days the wart will disappear.
Use of Gebanium Leaves.—lt is not gene*
rally known that the leaves of a geranium are
an excellent application for cuts, where the skin
is rubbed off, and other wounds of that kind.
One or two leaves must be bruised and applied
to the part, and the wound will be cicatrised in
a short time.
To Clean Black Lace.—Take the lace, and
wipe off the dust carefully with a cambric hand
kerchief, then pin it out on a bed, inserting a
pin in each projecting point of the lace. Sponge
it all over with table beer, and do not remove
tiie pins till it is perfectly dry. It will look
quite fresh and new.
Baspbebbx Vixxgab-—Carefully pick 6
pounds of fine ripe raspberries, and pour on
them four pints of the very finest vinegar.
Leave them thus for four days, frequently stir-1
ring, but not nothing the fruit so as to bruise
the seeds : then place a piece of clean washed
linen or flannel in a sieve, and filter through it
the vinegar, to each pint of juice adding two
pounds of loaf sugar; put it into a glazed jar
or pan, which place in hot water, and keep
there till tbe juice boils thick and sirupy. Let
it become cold, then bottle it. The whole pro
cess should be carried on in glazed earthen

At Morn, At Noon, At Eve.
F.C. URQUHART.
Cloncurry, 3rd January, 1888.
I said to my love at the dawning:
""Arise, love, and come with me
To gather the flowers of morning
That are fresh and fair like thee.""
And the lark was carolling far above
His song of happiness, joy, and love ;
And the music fell from the vault on high
As a welcome to her from the morning sky.
I said to my love at the noonday:
"" O stay, love, and rest thee here
In this fair green glade by Nature made
For the child she holds most dear.""
And the sunlight glinted beneath the shade
As she rested with head on her nosegays laid,
And the bright beams played with her golden hair
As if they had found their sisters there.
I cried to my love at evening:
"" O, love, leave me not alone!
O plead for me to be joined with thee
In bliss near the Great White Throne!""
And the cypress is waving to and fro
O'er the grave where my hopes are lying low,
And an angel is echoing far away

The night grows dark, and weird and cold; and thick drops
patter on the pane;
There comes a w ailing from the sea-the wind is weary of the rain!
The red cecils click beneath the flame ; and sec ! with Blow and
silent feet,
The hooded shadows cross the woods, to where the twilight waters
heat !
Now, funwise from the ruddy flic, a brilliance sweeps athwart the
floor ;
As, streaming down the lattices, the lain conies sobbing to the
dooi !
As, sti earning down the lattices,
The ram comes sobbing to the door !
Dull echoes round the casement fall, and thro' the empty cham-
bers go,
Like forms unseen whom we can hear, on tiptoe stealing? to and
fro!
Hut fill your glasses to the brim, and, through a mist of smile»
and tears.
Our ejes shall tell how much we love to toxst the shades of other
years !
And hither they will flock again, the ghosts of things that aro n»
more ;
While, streaming down the lattices, the rain comes sobbing to the
door !
While, streaming down the lattices,
The rain comes sobbing to the door !
The tempest-trodden wastelands moan-the trees arc threshing at.
the blast ;
And now they come the pallid shapes of dreams that perish'd i» '
the past ! < ?
And, when we lift the windows up, a smothei-'d whisper round us
strays,
Like some lone wandering voice from graves that hold the wreck» ,
of bygone days !
I tell ye that I love the storm, for think we not of thoughts of yore,
When, streaming down the lattices, the rain comes sobbing to the .

When, stroming down the lattices,
The rain comes sobbing to the door !
We'll drink to those we sadly miss, and sing some mournful
song we know,
Since they may chance to hear it all, and muse on friends they've
left below !
Who know6-if soul? in bliss can leave the borders of their Eden
