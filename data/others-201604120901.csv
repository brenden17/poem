COOK V. 11Y11NEÍ, AND ANOTHEK.
Tho trial of this case, which had already lasted two
days, was resumed and concluded.
It was on action bj- Simon Cook, a farmer of Illawarra,
against James Bj-mcs and William Byrnes, proprietors of
tho Mount Pleasant Colliery, to recover damages for the
pollution of a creek or small stream of fresh water which
ran through tho plaintiff's land, by coal from tho defend-
ants' worts. Tho plaintiff'B declaration put tho case in
two ways, first, that the creek had been wilfully polluted
by tho casting of coal therein ; secondly, that tho damiegti
had been the result of ncgltgenco. Tho defendants had
pleaded-first, a general doninl that thej- had dono any
injury to tho plaintiff ; secondly, that whatever injury had
been inflicted lind been the unavoid.iblo result of what thoy
had done in the lawful conduct of their businoss as coal
lumera.
Sir William Manning, Q.C., Mr. Darloy, and Mr. Salo-
mons, instructed by Mr. Maguire, appeared for the plaintiff;
and Mr.,Butlor, instructed by Messrs. Allen, Bowden, and
Allen, for the defendants.
Tho plaintiff was the lessee of Spring G rovo, a farm of
fifty acres, at Fairy Meadow, Wollongong district,
in the vicinity pf the Mount Pleasant Colliery. His
case was that a small stream of water which ran through
his and other lands in that neighbourhood had been ren-
dered unfit for uso bj- tho deposit of n largo quantity of
slocOc coal from the collierj' in question, ana that his farm
had boen otherwise injured from the samo cause. Tho
defendants' caso was that there had been no such injury,
and that although the creek might have boon partially fillod
up by slack coal, this had not been the result of any care
lossnoss on tho part of tho emploj-ccs at the colliery, but of
n land slip, the result of a flood, for which tho defendants
were not responsible. The evidenco was very voluminous,
and in'many respects very conflicting. Tho amount really
in question was a small one, but tho object of tho contest
was rather, it would appear, to determine tho genorol ques-
tion whether or not tho proprietors of cool mines in that
district were to be held responsible for damages of this cha-
racter. According to the plaintiff and his witnesses the
creek had clearly been damaged by the presence of a
quantity of slack coal which hod como down from an
immense henp noar the mouth of the mine-a result bl ought
about by the carelessness of the minors in allowing bo vast
an accumulation at such a place. Tho supply of water from
this creek had previously been regular ana abundant. Tho
water, although a littlo hard for washing purposes, hail
been excellent for every other kind of domestic use, but
since the conl had come down it had been quito useloss.
Tho waterholes had boen completely filled up, so that the
constancy of tho supplj- of water was to it great extent put
an end to, and such as was still to bo had was very bad.
The flood, too, bad carried tho slack coal over some of tho
cultivated land, and hod destroj-cd or damaged tho crops.
Cook had about forty head of cattle which had boen accus-
tomed to drink at this stream, but which could
now scarcely use ii. He had boon compelled
therefore to sink a well. Ho had offered to toke £20
in full compensation for these injuries, and for this sum to
clear out the bed of tho creek himself, but tho defendants
had refused lo give him that amount and had offered only
£10. According to tho defendant«' wltnosses the water of
this creek, which had always been a littlo brackish,.had
been in no way injured by tie influx of slack coal, which
was far less than had been represented, and was occasioned
solely by a landslip during a flood which hod brought down
at the samo time a largo quantity of soil. The spread of
slack coal over tho land to a small extent had rather a
tendency to increaso its productiveness than otherwise, and
tho catUo had in no way suffered. The^offer of £10 had
been tendered, it was sworn, without prejudico-that is to
say without admitting any liability-and only in tho hope
by dealing liberally with tho plaintiff to save all trouble and
expense. Samples of tho water from . this
creek were exhibited in Court, whioh sample«
presented a very uninviting appearance. It was contended
tint they had not been fairly token, but that the water must
havo been btorcd up, but this was denied. Some of this water
was analysed by Mr. Watt, from whose evidence it would
appear that its"" foulness aid not in all probability result
from tho presence of coal, but from that of organic matter.
It further appeared that watcrcrcsscs wore growing plen-
tifully in the creek, and that decomposed vegetable matter
might in dry weather help to make the water bad. Tho
water of the creek, according to Mr. Watt, was naturally
brackish, and tho slack coal from this'mino when settled
(as it. would, settle) ,at. tho bottom of theiBtreain when
' 'net flowing rapidly- would'« not pollute it as alleged.
There was nirtfccr evidence that a stream of water coming
.ut of the same seam of coal was quite pure, and was con-
stantly used for domestic purposes. Seme of the coal was
broken up in Court and placed in tumblers ef water, upon
which it left a slight scum, although without otherwiso
rendering the water apparently impure. The impurity, J
however, va« most positively «vom to by the plaintiff'« *
**""?""-~-i _.
.witnosBcs. Somo evidence was gone into on the part of tho
I ?'_.nti(T lo show that tho lond-slip, if it did canso tho dam-
age (which was denied), lind been the result of some mis-
management of tho excavation. This was mot by direct
contradiction on tho(pnrt of tho defendants. Tho ovidenco
was directly contradictory na to the quantity of slack coal
in tbo heap nenr the colliery, and in nearly ovcry other im-
portant particular, even ¡is to tho local features of tho
gi omul.
His IIokoh directed the jury that the plain ques-
tion for their deteniiiuation was whothor or not tho
plaintiff hnd mndo ont any claim to damages for
injurj"" sustained by him through any want oi duo core on
tho p'nrt of tho defendants' employes. Evory man had a
right to work n coal mine, but ho was bound so to monago
it as that his neighbours should not bo injured. Against
lend slips nud floods no amount of caro could guarel ; but
tho miners wero bound to exctciso duo caro and forethought
so ns when buch accidents took placo their neighbours
might bo «s little injured as possiblo by any escapo from tho

To the Editor of the Herald.
Sir,- The circumstances attending the doings of this gang
of murderous villains at Binda, on the 21st ultimo, as re-
ported in the Goulburn Herald of the 28th and re-published
in your journal of the 30th, have increased the wonder (if,
indeed that were possible), which has been expressed
throughout the colony, at the utter incapability of the
mounted and foot police force to cope with and capture, or
shoot down a few audaious, but cowardly ruffians, who
have, for a considerable time past, been engaged in murder-
ing residents or passengers in the districts, and then
miscreants are harboured; and in plundering, and then
destroying the stores and homesteads of the industrious
settlers, besides robbing the mails, drays &c.
This last outrage almost surpasses any that has yet been
recorded. Binda is a thriving post town ans police station,
in the Goulburn district.Early in the evening of the day
in question, Hall and his gang went to the store of a very
respectable man, named Morriss, and ordered himself and
his wife to dress and accompany them to the Flag Hotel,
where a ball was to take place,to which the landlord had
invited upwards of a hundred of the townspeople. This
order they were obliged to obey, and whilst so engaged the
gang secured about £ 1oo, which was in the store. Arriv-
ing at the hotel, they ordered the terrified household and
guests to go on with the dancing, in which they themselves
joined with the most reckless audacity. Morriss, who was
formerly a very active officer of police, saw that could he
but obtain the assistance of a few resolute men amoung
the visitors, the three villains could be successfully rushed
upon and captured, notwithstanding their being heavily
armed. About three o'clock in the morning, the required
assistance having been solemnly promised, the rush was to
be made. But vile treachery was at work; Hall and Gil-
bert were warned of the plan to seize them, and they imme-
diately advanced towards Morriss, each presenting a revolver
at him. By a sudden movement he leapt out of the window,
being fired at without effect. He, with the greatest speed,
made for the spot wher the horses of the gang were tied
up, and mounting one, galloped off pursued by the bush-
rangers, who fired several shots at him, which he
fortunatley escaped. Baffled in their pursuit,they
returned to the hotel and having declared to
those present their intention to burn Morriss's
store and stock-in-trade, they left the house
in order to carry out their threat, although Mrs.
Morriss clang to them in desperation and implored them
not to burn down her home. They went to the store, and
having again searched for money, they set fire to the pre-
mises, and in the course of a very short time the stores, the
valuable stock, a number of promissory notes, and the ac-
count books were entirely consumed.
Mr Morriss having concealed himself until he saw the
villains leave the spot,returned to the store, where he found
his wife lying in the agonies of grief on the ground before
the ruins of their building. Again mounting a horse, Mr
Morriss pushed on to Goulburn to report this outrage to the
police.On his arrival at the barracks he was informed that
the Superintendent was absent, and two hours were
lost by the mounted troopers in searching for
him, before pursuit was begun! This assuredly in a case
of scandalous neglect of duty, which demands immediate
investigation by the authorities.
We are informed that Mr Morriss applied to be imme-
diately readmitted into the police force, and sent in search
of the gang, but that the superintendent coldly said he
had no power to appoint him, but would accept his services
as a volunteer.
Having thus in as brief a space as possible, recapitulated
the incidents attending the outrage, the neglect of the
police, and the spirited offer of Mr Morriss, I will, with
your permission, offer a few words in regard to these start-
ling matters.
In his admirable speech at the Camdon Banquet, on the
28th ultimo, Mr James Macarthur asked "" Why should
not there be volunteers to put down bushrangers' He
would wage war with these desperadoes; he should consider
it a disgrace to live in a district that was infested by them.
Years ago he had gone out after the bushrangers himself in
company with the then clergymen of Campbelltown, and
other persons. He hoped this bushranging would be put
down, because it was doing the colony an infinitude of mis-
chief at home; it was turning immigration away from our
shores.
It is to be hoped that these remarks, from one of the most
influential of our colonists, will not be overlooked by the
Government, but that so brave a man as Morriss should be
at once invited to form a resolute volunteer party, to be
properly mounted, and furnished with the best arms, and
abundanee of ammunition, and further provided with orders
forrations on the settlers, to be paid for by the Treasurer.
By this means, there is little doubt that the hangman
would not much longer be robbed of his due , and that the
murderous ruffians,who have so long resigned with im-
punity,in districts where they have been harboured or
concealed by confederates, would be very quickly traced to
their haunts and handed over to the administers of those
laws which they have so long defied.
With regard to the heavy loss sustained by Mr.
Morriss-upwards of £1000-I can only express an earnest
hope that public subscription lists will be opened in every
town of the colony, not only to reimburse lhim for his
losses but also to present him with an honourable testi-
monial, as a tribute to his bravery.
I beg to remain, Sir,your obedient servant,

CORONER AT WAGGA WAGGA.
, Mr. BUCHANAN asked the Colonial Socretary,
"" 1. Did the Coroner of Wagga Wagga write the Colonial
Secretary a letter in dofenco of his conduct in reference to
ihc inquest on the death of Mrs. Rush ? 2. In that letter,
<.r in any communication from the Coroner of Wagga
Wnggo, did ho state that the sistcrB and brother-in-law of
Rush informed him that Rush hnd been addicted to drink-
ing for mnny yenrs past up to the present time ? 3. Is tho
Colonial Secretary aware that the two sisters of Rush, also
his brother-in-law, havo made affidavits, which affidavits
have appeared in the public papers, to tho effect that thoy
never communicated to tho Coroner of Wagga Wagga any
such information OB the Coroner asserts they did, in his
letter to tho Colonial Secretary; and that thoy also,
in theeo affidavits, allege that Rush is now, nnd
nlvvnys han been, a temperate and sober man ? 4. Is tho
Colonial Secretary aware that Rush himself, aB well as
his sisters and brother-in-law, in tho affidavits referred to,
nllrge that, in consequence of tho cruelty and neglect of
duty on the part of the Coronor of Waorga Wagga, in oom
iptjKing Rush to bring the dead body of his wife a distance
of over thirty miles, BO that an inquest might be hold, in-
stead of himself going to whero tho woman died, and there
¡holding tho inquest, so pained and distressed Rush, tho
¡husband, that his mind gavo wny under it, and ho remained
¡for nome timo in a state of temporary insanity ? fi. Has
'the Colonial Secretary removed the Coroner of Wagga
j Wogga from his position, or ia it his intention to do so,
¡without further delay Í ""
Mr. COWPER, in reply, stated that a lotter from tho
'Coioner nt Wagga Wagga had been recoived at his office,
and was rend by him to the Houso some time ago. He
, hardly thought it necessary to repeat the information whioh
, was eoniained in that letter. Yesterday certain affidavits
. wero received nt his office, but he had not yet had time to
, read thom. They would bo laid on the tablo on Tuesday
next. In the moantimo no docision had been arrived at by
' tLe Government.
ROAD l'ROM GOULBURN TO BRAIDWOOD.
Mr. GARRETT, for Mr. Butler, asked the Secretary for
Lauds,-""When will tho Government proclaim the road
iioui Goulburn to Braidwood, and tho deviation therefrom
frctn Taralga to Queanbeyan?""
Mr. COWPER enid tho road from Goulburn to Braid
w ood hnd boen proclaimed, and would bbortly bo proceeded
with. Tho deviation fiom Turnlga had been proclaimed,
but time would bnve to bo allowed for claims for compou
sntiou to be bent in.

Mr bAMUEL thought that, after tto discussion whioh
took place on tho previous night, it was unnooossary for

ttndcd to Yass, and whether m coming to Buoh a conclu-
sion thoy had been guided by the advicoof thoso sciontulc
' (lieera whom tho Government wiro bound to consult m
such a case
Mr SUTHERLAND eaid the estimate Aad baon nub
muted in accordance with tho roport of the officers
Sir JAMES MARTIN enid ho could not imagino for a
moment thnt the Government had tho loast oxpeclntion of
carrving this vote It so happouod thnt on tho previous
evining tho Houso was not afiordod an opportunity of ex-
pressing its opinion on tho proposal originally submitted to
it, Tho roport of tho committeo waB brought up, and a
motion was made that tho recommendations contninod in
thnt rinorl Bhould bo ndopted. J ho Houso had not pro-
nounced its opinion on the matter. Ho gathered from
what wns taid in tho courso of tho dobato by mimbors of
the Government, thal tbey at this moment woro not in a
l>osition to snj whit hmd of n rnilnav it w s most expe-
dient to construct, provided further extonaions wera uutlio

unable to determine a ma ter of that kind His lion mond
at iho head of the Government read nn interesting ixtnct
iiom n recent numbir of tho Itmes m which it
wns stated that the Russian Government, who v^oro

inn resting and vnlunble chnrnetor Ho tboreforo
contended that befoio tho Government proccodod with

lead IIB to believe, tho country hadmado a miBtako in oon
s/ructing lines of railwaj» with n broud gaugo, with heavy
locomotives and trucks, when nil the ndvintigcs of railwvy
communication could bo secured bj narrow lines with light
echini B and other miling stock, it waa timo tho Government
paused lo deliberately consider tho question. Tho fact was
before them that tho Russiun Government somo joara ago
cunmcnccd a railway from TeBtiniog to Portmadoo, a
distanco of \¿\ miles, at a cost of something like £2000 por
mile This lino, ho obsorvod, had originally been com-
ún need at great cost, but upon the recoinmeudation of nn
English engineer-Mr. Fairlie-tho Russian Goiernment
stoiped the works morder to mnkcinquiries into tho ex-
penditure necessary for tho construction of nnrrow gaugo
railwnjB. Iho result was that the roBt of ihn line was not
onlv constructed with a nnrrow gnuge, but twolvo miles
which bad nlrondy been laid down wis taken up The
Russian Government also sent BODIO of its most ominent
engineers to inquire into tho matter, who j unod with
D nmiirk, Trance, Germany, and England in experiments
to test the value of the narrow guage sjstom If wo
could construct railways at a cost of £2000 per milo with
ly.Lt engines, carriages, and trucks, the country would bo
much moro inclined to sanotion nn expenditure to carry su""h
a svsttm into tho interior than to sanction a further expen-
diture of £10,000 or £15,000 per mile to go »n with the
prisent extensions If tho result of tho experiments which
had been rondo in Europo was before the Government
thi j would boin a much botter position to say what system
thej intended to ndopt, nnd thoj would bo acting wisely in
withdrawing the cstimnto until such information had
rinched them, He hoped, therefore, that tho Government
Honld net upon such advice, and not ask tho Houso to givo
a decision upon the voto, for ho did not wish tho Houeo to
tolo any step which would reflect upon their policy. Tho
lino of roilwny to whioh he hnd referred was 1 i', miles ia
length, nnd had been in operation for ooiuo years, and had
cost no moro than £5000 por milo including the oxpendi
turo on a tunnel which extended to n distance of 700
ynrdp, a work much moro cxponsivo than the tunnols on
the Bnthui st line
(An hon member "" What is tho state of labour in the
country r ')
Sir JAMES MARTIN said that labour was cheapor
than it wns here, but the cost of land made up for that,
whilo in the colony land WOB much cheaper It was proved
that the cost of tho wenr and tear of our linos aroso froa
tbo enormous weight of the rolling stock. Wo took an
ongino weighing 35 tonB with a vory heavy rolling stock,
while in eomo instances the trafilo was confined to a fow
flooring boards or a few louds of hay, amounting to one or
two tone Iho materials which wero convojed woro, thero
fore, out of all proportion to the truaks, and would not pay
the coat of working The light system of railway of which
be had been spenking would, however, only have n gua^o
of H feet, nnd in the casa of the Uno to which ho hid
particularly called attention, tho lino hud not
on)j been found to answer all requirements, but
hud paid dividends of 29J per cent The
gradients were also something remirkablo, nnd tho curveB
could be travelled over at tolerable speed, and with tho
greatest safety. There woro somo railways in England in
which the narrow gauges wero used, nnd tue same
system hnd been adopted m Trance and other parts of tho
world lhere could be no doubt that m Russia the
Government wero fully alive io tho importance of tho
question because of the groat extent of territory to be
cevered, and therefore tho inv ostigationa which had beon
mudo would bo of very great benefit Wo were now in a
position to take advantage of theBo great experiments, and
tbo Government ehou'd pause until the results wero boforo
them Ho submitted that the Govomment would do well
to hold back the Estimates for a few weeks, so that all tho
available information which could bo obtained was
received
Mr. COWPER admitted that there was a great deal of
truth in the remarks whioh hnd fallen from the hon
member, 1 ut tho proposition of the hon member carno rather
unexpectedly, and had taken the Government by surprise.
Ho was, therefore, not prepared atonce to state what courso
tho Government would pursue, although after a fow
minutes' conference they might amvo at a decision. Ho
would, however, point out that considerable difficulties
would ensue upon the withdrawal of tho estimate, seeing
that thero wero a largo number of workmen and contractors
on the lineB who would havo to be disbanded. Tho Go-
vernment ought to have a reasonable timo to conBidor the
proposition. At the present time his hon colleague, the
Colonial Treasurer, waa collecting soma information as to
tbo works now proceeding, to ascertain how far the worka
had progressed up to the present timo, but at tho present
moment he did not seo any difficulty m the Government
withdrawing tho item, unless bia hon colloAguo suggested
ftomo difficulty of a moro formidable ohnracter He thought
the Gov ernment had committed itsolf to works of a vory ex-
pensive character, which could have been constructed at
one-half tho cost, and tho information ho had gamed of
the working of tho Queensland and other linoB convinced
him of this fact, but he was not propared, without consi-
deration, to accept tho proposition of tho bon mombei for
EaBt Sydney
Mr. BUCHANAN said there wero other objections te
the estimate besides those advanced by the bon. and learned
member for East Sydney. He (Mr Buchanan) objected

policy, and he could seo nothing which vi ould prevent the
bankruptcy of the colony if tho présent expenditure of
mt ncv for tho construction of railways wero s inctioned
Ho tfiought, taking the population of Bathurstnnd Orange,
that thero would bo a ruinous Ins» on the outlay , and tho
same might bo said of other districta to whioh it
was proposed to give railwav extension. But ho
thought the objoct in view was tho concilia
tn n of the reprcBontntive8 of thoso districts.
We had also a proposition to construct a railway from
Goulburn to Yass, out of borrowed nionoy, which could
onlv havo the effect of gratifying the cupidity of different
Governments, and result in rum to the colony With tho
financée of the countrj vorging on bankruptcy, it was
monstrous to bring forward such propositions as this Lot
the Government introduco population into this wide
country to develop its expansive resouiccs, and then we
shtuld require railways and be able to pay for them
£241,000 for a railwaj from Bathurst to Orango would bo
nriecoof prepobterous folly, and if any private company
proposed it with their own resources tbey would bo pro«
iiounccd menee Tho receipts would be infinitesimal
Wo had nlrcndy constructed moro railways than the
country required, und having done that we might now
tit on the stool of repentance and look at our empty cir
ruiges running to absoluto seed. Ho would not be a party
to borrowing any moro money. We found tho Govern-
ment remitting taxation for purty purposes, constructing
railways for party purpose», and doing everything to pleaso
everybody and keep themselves m office, and it was high
timo to put a drag upon this sort of thing Our finances
wero in n hornblo state of confusicn, and if tno truth were
known, our expenditure was exceeding our income, and,
metí ad of imposing now taxation, wo woro adopting tho
Îrnctico of borrowing money for every conccivablo purposo.
f these p-oposnls to construct railways between placos
which had ne population wero known in England, they
would lauth the Government to seam, and look upon us as
a parcel of lunatics
bir JAMES MARTIN said, that if we had decided as to
the kind of railways wo should construct, Btill ho could not
givo his support to the construction of theso throe lines.
Ho still retained the opinion that tho propor course to con-
struct a railway m a national point of view was, to take it
to the south, and the Government of whioh ho waa a
member did proposo to take tho lino to Nnrandorn. Rail
w ays wero constructed m the United States, not onlv from
one inhabited place to another, but, in thousands of in-
stances, thoy had been taken to places where thero
was no population, nnd thej wero invariably found

men btr who urged that they should oarry tho line to the»

suppco that such a courso could secure the trade to Syd

Victorian line (hear, hoar) becauso by so doing thoy would
tako tho trado to Victoria If tho Viotonans had a
lino to tho froottor, and they took ono to some other point,
would that carry the whole of the trado of the colony t
They could no moro provent tho traffic boing divortedto
Victoria, if the Victorian terminus wore tho noarost point,
than they could stop a foaming torrent It was impossible.
They ought to connect the two lines (Hear, hear ) It
would bo desirable for many purposes-tor tho purposo of
union and federation, which bo believed would ultimately
como about. It would be statesmanlike policy to connect
tho two linos Produce would then como to the nearest
and bcBt market, whether that market wero Sydney
or Melbourno, and it waa a narrow policy
which said they should not connect them.
It was altogothor a narrow and unmistakable polioy to
imoç,iuo that the traffic could bo diverged from the boat
nunket Iho hon and learned member would tako tho
Uno to tho Southern territory becauso ho desired to settle
population m a countrj which could bo cultivated only by
irrigation Surely Bathurst and Orango presented greater
facilities, where there was plenty of rich land which coald
bo cultivated without irrigation In tho neighbourhood of
Orango whoat could be produced varying from twonty to
íorty bushels per aoro, ana thoro wero also rich coppor and
gold mines. Ho maintained that if the polioy wero
adopted of extending the line to tho south, they ought to
om and connect tho two capitals Whenevor thoy
did determine upon a vote for the extension
of railways, ho thought thoy ought to go to
Orango (Laughter and oheers ) But having epokon
to tho Engineer in-Chief in rogurd to tho matter ho did
not think that any grout injury could occruo if this esti-
mule were withdrawn for a timo (Cries of "" Oh, oh."")
If ho thought any injury would ncoruo irom such an
arrangement ho would bo no party to it, and ho would bo
no patty to an extension to tho south, unless thora was an
extension also to the west and to tho north [An hon.
me mber And the east Laughter ] If thero was likely
to bo uny evidence produced to show that sorviceablo linos
could be constructed at loes cost ho thought it would bo
weil to pause, but ho confessed that ho hud some misgiv-
ings in regard to tho courso ho was ab»ut to take This
was a favourable timo for raising monoy in the English
market, and ho would rather that the House gava the
Government tho money, and left it to thom to make all
neccBBary inquirios in regard to the railways to which
roferenco had been made, before making the expenditure.
It was only becauso he thought tho feeling of the House
wus in favour of gaining further inform ic_on that ho gava

Mr ONSLOW Baid ho agreed with tho hon and learned
member (Sir James Murtiu) that tho railway to the south
ehould bo extended, but ho was of opinion that it ought to
join tho Melbourno lino If Melbourno took away some e£
our trade we should get something from Viotocia Ha
could not help thinking that this question was nut con-
sidered on national grounds, and that there was a mean
feeling in connection with the matter. If it could be dono
ho ehould like very much to test the sense of the House tut
to what lmo ehould bo constructed first If he wore in
'order ho would like to movo that tho Southern lino bo ex-
tended to Wogga Wugga
Mr LACKEY said such a motton could not now be put
Mr ONSLOW said thero wero a good many members
who had got "" a bndgo agin Ihoir place "" and did not cara
about tho railway going any farther Ho did not think wo
wero rioh enough to oxtend tho thrco linos simultaneously,
but was convinced that if any railway would pay it would
bo the Southern when connected with Melbourne.
Mr WILSON said that a more extraordinary speeoh than
/ that of the Treasurer liBd never been dohvorod by any Min-
ster in that HOUBB. The bon. gentleman seemed to havo
forgotten the hifeh position ho held, and had allowed hu
feeling as member for Orango to overcome the higher duty
which dovolvod upon him of looking after the com-
mercial prosperity of tho colony He (Mr. Wilson) did not
soo why we ehould spend millions of money for the purposo
of benefiting Victoria Viotona made its railway towards
our colony for the purposo of taking away our traffic
Wo had twice the number of sheop thoy had in Victoria,
and jet Victoria exported twice the quantity of Wiol ox
ported fioni this colony He thought it was our duty ta
top the Murrumbidgco with tho view of restoring that
tnielo Tho fact of tho matter was thiB, tho pafls°ngor
traffic for manj years to como, witn our sparse population,
would not malo our roilwaja pay Wo muBtlook to tho
carnago of wool and other produce to make them pay.
Another argument usad by tho bon Treasurer waschet
the two cities of Melbourno and Sydnoy should bo umtoi
for the purposes of defence That was morely a fanciful
idea If any of tho largo Powers wera to land in this
colcnj, tho assistance which wo Bhould got frota
Melbourne would avail us very little indeod.
Ho waa nslonishod at tho mgumont used by tho
hen Treasurer with respect to tho ad valorem
duties The hon Treasurer stated that if wo earned a raü
wav to the Murrumbidgee, persons in that district would
overlook then own interests, and still continue to trado with
Melbourne Our ad valorem duties wero 6 per cont , tim
ad valorem duties of Victoria wore 10 per cent And wo
were told bj tho Ircasurcr that ho intended to tako off th»
ad valorem duties hero altogether Ho did not beliovo that
persons in the bouthcrn parts of tho colony would bo so
dead to their own interests IIB to continuo to trado with Mel-
bourno under such circumstancas Ho believed that if a
railway was constructed to tho Murrumbidgee the trado of
that district would bo entirely restored to Sydney There
was another point m favour of Sydney, and that was the
superior facilities Bflbrded in our harbour for shipping
ge ods to the facilities afforded at Melbourno The superior
fuulities that Sjdney possessed for shipping was, ho be-
lieved, equal to 100 or 150 miles of railway Ho know that
if a railway was to be constructed to the Murrumbidgee,
nany of tho Melbourno merchante would shift their
quaitcrs to Sydnoy, in order to take advantago of
tho facilities offered m this port for shipping

struction of the Southern line only, he believed that by

STATE OF THE CHINESE EMPIRE.
(By the Special Correspondent of the Overland China
Mail.)
HANKOW, 5th August, 1862.
THERE is nothing in the present aspect of affairs
which promises the dawning of a more peaceful day
upon this distracted land. Ten long years have
elapsed since the beginning of these commotions;
and, for aught we can see just now, ten or twenty
more are likely to follow ere they subside. Here
dynastic changes, like all other changes, move
on very slowly ; they generally take from twenty to
forty years for their consummation. There are
no reasonable grounds for hoping that this
will be accomplished within a shorter period. China
is what she has ever been—slow, stolid, stagnant;
and it is hardly fair to expect from her, in her dotage,
signs of greater life and vigour than she was wont to
display in the days of her much-vaunted strength. A
well-instructed Chinaman, reviewing the events of
ages gone by, sees nothing strange in all that is
going on around him. He looks upon the decade of
turmoil which has just passed, and anticipates the
coming, too, as inevitable in the history of his nation.
""These things needs be."" Such is his reply to any
remark you may please to make on the judgments
that are now shaking the very foundations of the
empire. In this he is doubtless right. Were it not
for these frequent visitations, China would have sunk
long ere this under the pressure of her accumu-
lated vices. This apparently destructive element
has been the means of preserving the political
and social life of the people from entire extinction.
A Chinaman reasons more philosophically on the sub-
ject than we seem capable of doing. We point to the
present strife, and say, ""That is hell-born."" ""No-
thing of the kind,"" remarks the Chinaman, ""it is only
an expression of the mind of Heaven."" We pro-
nounce it poison ; the Chinaman calls it medicine.
""It will convert your rich and fair country into a
barren heath,"" observes the foreigner. ""No danger,""
rejoins the Chinaman, "" it will only destroy the
weeds ; and when it is all over, we shall ring harvest
home more loudly and heartily than we have done for
the last fifty years.""
Let anyone take Hankow (called by the natives the
"" Centre of the Empire "") for his stand-point, and
calmly survey the surrounding provinces, and he will
have some idea of the extensive disorder which pre-
vails, and of the utter impotence of the central
government to cope with the evil.
Si-Chwan is to the west of us. This, the largest
and one of the finest provinces in the empire, is in a
complete state of anarchy. Shih-tah-kai, one of the
old followers of the "" Celestial King,"" is there with
400,000 men. Li-ta-ta is there at the head of a mil-
lion of men. The capital is reported to have been
taken by him. Li-ta-ta is not connected with either
the Tai-pings or Shih-tah-kai. He is setting up for
himself, and hopes in due time to drive all parties
from the field. Though the number of his men is
doubtless greatly exaggerated, still, to justify the ex-
aggeration, it must be enormous.
Kwei Chow and Yun Nan are also more or less
convulsed.
The news has just arrived at Hankow, that Shih-
tah-kai has passed over into Shen-si with a large
body of men. This is regarded by the natives as a
splendid move on his part. The province is famous for
its great merchants and wealth. The Imperialists
will find it difficult to dislodge him from his mountain
fastnesses, if he is determined to hold them. He has
also taken some places in the north-western parts of
the province of Hupeh.
Honan is to the north of us. This province has
been the prey of the Honan Filchers for many years.
In vain have the Imperialists tried to cope with them.
They aim at nothing but plunder. They take a place,
remain in it as long as it affords them the means of
subsistence, and, when thoroughly exhausted, they
bid it a temporary farewell. The mandarins have
learned this, and act accordingly. Very seldom, or
ever they come into collision. The ""Fathers of the
People"" go out at one gate, and the filchers enter at
another. When the latter retire, the former return, and
resume their places as the loving fathers of the people.
These filchers are the men that defeated the famous
Sun-kuh-ning-sin in several successive engagements
last year, and ravaged the whole of the province of
Shan-tung; they are the men that murdered Messrs.
Holmes and Parker. They are now threatening to
pay a visit to Tien-tsin, and to do with the province
of Chih-li as they have done with those of Shan-tung
and Honan. The natives say that the Tai-pings are
very angels compared with these incarnate demons.
The province of Kiang-su and Che-kiang, and parts
of Ngan-hwei, are in the hands of the Tai-pings.
They have evacuated several places of importance
within the last twelve months. To say that the Im-
perialists have recovered them, would be untrue.
Most of the cities on the banks of the Yang-tse had
become useless, or nearly so, to them. This will
probably account for their giving them up so easily.
Since the foreign powers in China have thrown their
influence on the side of the Imperialists, these cities
have become a source of weakness rather than of
strength to their cause. Thousands of braves have
been passing under their guns in foreign ships, and
they have not dared to put match to powder. All
they could do was to gnash their teeth, shake their
heads, and swear vengeance. Nanking is being closely
besieged again, and there is a rumour that the ""Celes-
tial King "" is thinking seriously of removing his
Capital. Should he do so, he will probably fix on
Hangchow. That the Imperialists, single-handed,
will be able to take Nanking, is out of the question ;
that the chief may think it prudent to leave, from fear
of a visit from the English and French, is possible
enough. It is quite credible that within six months
this noble city will cease to be the capital of the
""Great Peace"" dynasty. What then? Will the re-
bels scatter ? ""Will their power be broken. Will
Taipingdom come to naught ? This is not probable.
Their very existence and future prosperity depend
upon their adopting such a measure. In the interior
they will be at a safe distance from our shot and shell,
and will be able to carry on their aggressive measures
without fear of interference on the part of the outside
nations. The probable result of such a retirement
would be the extension of their operations into the
provinces of Kiang-si, Fuh-kien, and Canton.
""There is a vague rumour that the Yingwang (gen-
erally called the "" Four-eyed Dog "") has been cap-
tured by the Imperialists, or by Miau-pei lin, who
threatens to hand him over to the Imperialists. If
true, the Tai-pings have lost their bravest general.
Like most rumours of the kind, however, it is likely
to turn out false.
At Shanghae and Ningpo, the Tai-pings have
proved themselves to be a foe not quite so despicable
as we had supposed them to have been. In more than
one engagement they have shown considerable pluck ;
and the recapture of Ningpo has cost us more than we
had bargained for. The French have lost an excellent
Admiral, and our noble Admiral has had a very
narrow escape in these engagements. The Tai-pings
seem to hold Ward in great contempt ; and when
alone, they generally show him that, out of Imperialist
soldiers, he can make nothing but Imperialists soldiers.
These fellows are likely enough to hand him over
some fair day. Probably, he would have been in the
safekeeping of his foes long ere this, were it not for
the timely and generous aid of an arm stronger than
his, which has been stretched forth more than once
for his rescue.
Having been sadly beaten whenever they have had
the boldness to dispute the ground with the English
and French openly, the Tai-pings have very wisely
for themselves changed their tactics. They will no
longer meet us face to face; they will exchange no
more powder and shot with us if they can help it ;
but they will hover about us, cut off all supplies,
seize our boats, kidnap our men, and vanish into air
like so many spectres, the moment the attempt is
made to grasp them. Pursue them into the interior,
and they sniff the air, and laugh at your madness ;
return, and you will find them at your heels. This is
a sort of fighting which we shall find desperately hard
to deal with ; and this is on enemy that bids fair to
wear out our patience before the work is half done.
We recovered several cities and towns around Shang-
hae. Not being numerically strong enough to hold them
ourselves, and the Chinese being too craven-hearted
to, do so, they have all been abandoned, and subse-
quently re-occupied by the Taipings. Would that as
much wisdom as courage had been displayed in the
recent measures which had been adopted at Shanghae.
The latter is conspicuous enough—the former is sadly
wanting. In forsaking these captured cities, by
reason of rebel pressure, and thus confessing our in-
ability to accomplish what we had undertaken, we
have lost prestige and much moral power. The rebels
will regard each case as a signal victory ; and the Im-
perialists are beginning to whisper that foreign
generals and admirals are good for nothing, and their
own little better. Then, what an amount of misery
and wretchedness do we heap up for the people by
such measures. Mere compassion for the people who
are the victims of both rebel and imperialist cruelty and
rapacity, ought to deter us from adopting rash,
ill-advised, counsels in the present crisis.
Moreover, we have converted the Taipings into
bitter enemies to all foreigners, without gaining
the slightest personal advantage, or in the slightest
degree ameliorating the condition of others. Before
adopting such measures, the following questions ought
to have been seriously considered, ""Is it right? If
so, is it practicable ? If practicable, would it be
prudent ? Is England prepared seriously to entertain
the thought of the annexation of China ? If so, how
is the difficulty with France and Russia to be over-
come? What provinces shall we take to ourselves,
and what provinces shall be handed over to the other
parties in the field ? These are all fair questions.
But there seems to be a very strong anti-rebel mania
prevailing just now, and a determination to put it
down, come what there may. For this purpose our own
glorious admiral and ward are seen walking abreast to
the battle-field; Chinamen are taught the foreign
mode of warfare ; and our steamers are allowed to
convey Imperialist troops from Hankow to Shanghae.
We believe that the upshot will prove, that blind pas-
sion has been wielding the sceptre of late, and not
calm judgment. If Shanghae is to be defended, why
not do so from the only place where it can be done
effectually. The movements of the rebels can be con-
trolled only from Nanking ; and it is there the
Admiral ought to make his power felt—not by driving
the rebels out, which would be a suicidal course, but
by making the chief feel that his tenure of it depends
upon his faithfulness to his promises. This would cost
us but little, and the thing would be done effectually.
If we wish to see peace restored to the land, then
let us observe the strictest neutrality between the con-
tending parties. It will never be restored by
attempts to put down these movements for a
defunct government. Any interference on our part in
behalf of the Imperialists, will only protract a struggle
which must go on till a dynastic change is effected. It
is absurd to expect the Chinese to bring this about in
any fashion except their own. They will do it in
their own time and way.
And why should we render to the Imperialists the
slightest aid ? We have nothing to hope from them,
but everything to fear. They are not friendly to us,
and for aught we can see now, never will be. They
would drive us into the sea to-morrow if they had the
power. Look at their conduct towards foreigners at
Hankow or Kiukiang. Were it not for foreign
interference, Hankow would have fallen into the
hands of the rebels a year ago. The people
are now returning in large numbers, the native
hongs are springing up with amazing rapidity, and
the place promises to be as flourishing as ever within
two or three years. All this is to be traced to the
presence of foreigners. But, in spite of the good we
have done them, the mandarins seem bent
upon annoying, despising, and cheating us
to the utmost of their power. They in-
duced our representatives to fix upon the most
worthless ground in the place for a British settlement,
and have kept us waiting for it for more than a
twelvemonth. When fixed upon, the value of a lot
in that part of the town would be about three or four
hundred taels ; now they want five thousand
taels. Our boats are stopped here and
there and everywhere along the river, by
petty mandarins, because we won't pay them squeezes.
We are insulted, and not unfrequently molested by
the braves ; and the mandarins declare that they can't
manage them. When asked if they could manage
them were they themselves the victims of such indig-
nities, they reply that the two cases are different.
Not long since, a gentleman was sadly bruised by
these braves, and then taken on board their boat,
where he was made to go through the three prostra-
tions and the nine knocks. The boat was seized, in
consequence, by our authorities, and sent down the
Yangtse in a blaze. A severe argument this! but,
unfortunately, it seems to be the only kind of argu-
ment they are capable of appreciating. Ever since,
the mandarins have been more careful, and the braves
more civil.
We are told, however, that Prince Kung is our
friend. Well, it is the opinion of some, who are not
very bad judges in such matters, that Prince Kung is
playing a double game. One thing is certain, Prince
Kung is either insincere, or a mere cipher in the
Empire. The Mandarins in these parts act in direct
opposition to the letter of his treaty, and his subse-
quent instructions. The case of the Roman Catholic
priests and converts is a conclusive proof of this.
According to the treaty, persons teaching or profess-
ing the Christian religion shall alike be entitled to the
protection of the Chinese authorities ; nor shall any
such, peaceably pursuing their calling, and not offend-
ing against the laws, be persecuted or interfered with.
Prince Kung in the Peking Gazette has been reiterating
these sentiments calling upon the mandarins to treat
the Roman Catholic converts justly and lovingly, and
promising that the clause in which the Roman Catho-
lic religion is proscribed shall be omitted in all future
editions of the Sacred Edict. All this is very good ;
but in these provinces, any petty mandarin seems to
regard the whole as bosh. This must be because they
have a deeper insight into the secret counsels
of Prince Kung than our Minister seems to have, or
because he is powerless in the administration of
affairs.
Not long since, an examination was held at Nan
Chang, the provincial capital of Kiangsi. The Eng-
lish, French, and Russians were the theme. The ex-
amination was concluded by a combined assault on
the Roman Catholic establishment. The life of the
foreign priest was sought, but he managed to escape,
and afterwards to reach Kiu Kiang in safety. This
was done under the immediate notice of the great
officers of government, and, doubtless, with their
tacit consent. Placards have been posted up in
different parts of the province, denouncing our ag-
gressive policy, exposing our excessive barbarism,
and explaining our recent proceedings against the
rebels as an atonement to the government for our past
offences.
In the province of Kwei Chow, a foreign priest, has
just been executed by orders of the local mandarin.
He produced his passport ; but was told that it was a
foreign affair, with which his Excellency had nothing
to do.
In Hunan, a regular system of persecution has been
going on for some time. Chapels have been pulled
down, houses of the converts have been broken into,
and their property confiscated. The mandarins are
either unable or unwilling to do anything in the
matter.
In Peking, the Protestant religion is prohibited. A
medical missionary of large experience and high
standing is there, but he is not allowed to appear in
his compound character. He may heal the sick, but
he must not save souls. A chaplain is there, who
possesses an extensive acquaintance with the Manda-
rin dialect. Whilst requested to preach every Sun-
day to the handful of his fellow-countrymen who re-
side in the capital, he dare not mention these things to
the myriads of heathen who perish for the lack of know-
ledge. It is reported that he is allowed to teach a
dozen or more Tartar youths the English language, on
the condition that they hear nothing from him of
Christ and him crucified. One of our best missionaries,
who by his learning and piety, would do more to raise
the English character in the estimation of the magnets
of Peking than any dozen of common men, has found
it impossible to enter that city as a missionary.
During his fortnight's visit, he might talk to the
people about everything and everybody, except Christ
and his religion.
Whose fault is this? Are these Prince Kung's
doings ? We doubt it, and that for the good reason
that Roman Catholic priests are there, carrying on
their work boldly and openly, without any one dar-
ing to make them afraid. It is difficult to see why
the Chinese government should regard the Roman
Catholic priests with greater favour than the Protes-
tant missionary. There is not the slightest danger of
disturbance being excited by the preaching of the
Gospel in the city. Missionaries have visited
the surrounding towns and cities, and have
found the people remarkably well disposed;
It is not probable that they are different within the
walls of the capital. The odium of this must fall, we
fear, on one nearer to us than Prince Kung. Such a
policy is unjust and ill-advised. It must be given up
sooner or later. Why not at once ? It is high time
this matter should be minutely sifted, and its injustice
thoroughly exposed.
Such is the present aspect of affairs. It is rather
gloomy and discouraging. Let us hope that better
times are coming, and that all these commotions, and
apparently adverse circumstances, will be succeeded
by a brighter day than has ever yet dawned on this
land._
A NEW CONFEDERATE IRON-CLAD. — A corres-
pondent of the Dublin Evening Mail writes as follows:
— ""She can steam from 16 to 18 knots an hour, is
perfectly seaworthy, for all practical purposes in-
vulnerable, and will prove to any vessel she may
encounter as formidable an antagonist as our own
Warrior, the boast of the British navy. This is the
'No. 290,' as to whose whereabouts Federal cruisers
have with reason betrayed such anxiety. It had been
known for some time that a large and powerful iron
vessel was being constructed at the dockyard of
Messrs. Laird, Birkenhead ; but monsters of the deep
are so much the order of the day at that establish-
ment that no one troubled his head much about this
new production, or cared to remark the extra thick-
ness of the plates which were being used. At the
very last moment the Federal authorities seem to have
had their suspicion aroused, for the Tuscarora was
dispatched to keep watch in the neighbourhood of
the dock where she lay, and the southern
coast of Ireland was also strictly guarded
'No. 290,' meanwhile, apprised of all that was going
on, dropped down the river quietly one day, and
steamed out into the bay, nominally for her trial trip,
with a party of ladies and musicians on board. In-
stead, however, of returning to her moorings at Bir-
kenhead, where she would have been kept in durance
vile by the Tuscarora, she quietly landed her pas-
sengers at Holyhead, and proceeded on her voyage,
avoiding the harbours of Cork, Waterford, &c , in the
neighbourhood of which she might have heard of
something not all to her advantage. 'No. 290'
steamed round by Londonderry and Donegal, and was
joined off the west coast of Ireland by the steamer,
which had previously started, having on board the
armament intended for the gigantic Ironsides. Had
she even met the Tuscarora while still unarmed it
was the intention of her captain to try the fortune of
war by running stem on at full speed into her anta-
gonist. It needs no extraordinary powers of discern-
ment to discover what excitement must be caused at
the other side of the Atlantic by the arrival of the

lho work m physics liad bceu through
out of a Ratisfacton character, and tho
futuro of tho school in that branch was pKomiBing
and hkoly to show further development
Tho Chairnmu called upon tho head master to
address tho audience
Mr Er-VEST T HOBSON, B A , tho head master,
gavo a rcsumt of tho past year Ho Haul it had
been for all of thom a rather trying yeai lot, from
tho way in which tho school had hoon sup
nortoj, nothing wrcicua bid happened« Turu
ing from the darker to what ho termed
the brighter side, there had beon a good deal of evi-
dence that the old, if he might so term thom, mstitu
tiona of the school had been successfully car-
ried on, and ono or two now ones in-
augurated Ihey would And at the bottom
of the prize list, ""RcwardB for good work
and conduct "" Ihey thought it would be a good
featuie to let parents know that their boys were
working well, and he was certain that the institution
had done good In this way tho masters got a good
deal of support from the home, and he especially
asked motho-s not to forgot what a groat influence
thoy could exert, not only on the boys' In es morally,
bnt intollectuallv as well Ho would like to be able
to put into every parent's hands the Hon A Little
ton's book entitled "" Mothers and bo»s "" After
speaking of the success of the school us indicated in
the ropoits of the eiammations, ho referred to tho
dosirability of supplementing tho school work by
courses of carpentry and physical sciences, for in a
country lil o this they wanted men who could uBe
their 'hands rs well ns their heads
JIa did not say that *hev should throw
ovor intellectual studies thoy should rather go
into thom with groator keenness but what ho did
sty was that, whilst teaching the languages and his-
tory of the past they should ondcavoui to do as littlo
useless work as possible Ho was convinced that
thoj could fe ni for moro reading of classical authors
-Latin nnd Greek-ami less composition That was
if the University would bo content w ith less compost
tion Thoy would then not lind pooplo standing up and
saying that tho classics w ero ofteto and no good He
thought it was the duty of the school to undertake
the manual as well as mental training and to turn
out tho boys entrusted to their caro as perfect meu as
it was possible to do He concluded hy paying a
high tributo to tho assistant masters for their loyal
co-oporation during the year (Applause )
Admiral BOWDEN-bMiTii then distributed the
prizes, tho recipients not only receiving commonda.
tion lrom lum, but wero heaitily choerod as thoy
went forward Tho Admiral thou said that, whilst
feeling the honour tho council had done lum
in asking lum to proscnt the prizes, he wished
that the person invited had hid more knowledgo of
school lifo than he had had Ho joined the navy in
IS.JJ, and at that time the boys who joined went
straight to sea, and he had a very lively recollection
of his fathor taking him down to Portsmouth aid
leaving him ou boord the Vwtory, JSTel»on's own
ship, and soon after he was sent off to the Ei3t
Indies However, on the Britannia, latot on, ho
picked up something of scheol ways and Behool
customs, and the proceedings of that day re-
minded bun voiy much of what used to
tako place at Dartmouth at the distribution of
prizis to tho cadets Ho was very pleased to .lotice
tho great progress that school hud mado since its
opening only a fon years ago, and ho was glad te see
that manly oiercieos woro well kept up, for he
believed they were highly necessary for de
veloping the muscles a»d occupying spare
timo, eo long as thev did not take the place of more
useful things Ho had mentioned the word ""homo,""
and he might say that nothing had surprised lum
moro than te hear people who were born out here
speaking abtut England as home It was vory
pleasing to him to hear the old country spokeu of ¡u
that n ay (Cheers ) Ho hoped that tho feeling
would exist, not only in Australia, but
m overy other English community After
all, this was the country of their adoption,
and therefore it should be their happiness
and pleasure to do all they could to dovelop its re
sources (Applause ) Ho concluded by expressing
the wish that thoy would have a \ory pleasant
Christmas and enjoyablo holidays, and that
thev would all do their best to try to
inako it, if it nore not now, tho very best school
m Australia, for their future depended very much
ou their own exertions (Applause )
Tho CHAIRMAN said thev thanked the Admiral for
being there and distributing the prizes, and re-
turned him all tho good wishes ho bad ex
pressed towards them Ho was sorry t»
sa} that Ins (tho Primate's) fnond, the Rev II L
Jackson, M A , had boon obliged to leavo ¡sydney for
a timo on account of his health, and therefore to

The Crosshill, from Liverpool, with general
merchandise, valued at £G400, and the Cold-
stream, from Melbourne, with a portion of
original cargo from New York, arrived to-
day.
This was what is known in business circles
as one of the slack days. The demand for
flour was active, and unless immediata
supplies come from Adelaide, it ia
expected that a further advance will
have to be reported in a few days.
Slates have increased in value, and there ia
also an upward movement in cement, owing
to tho short shipments ad vie ed by mail. The
non-arrival of several shipments of new brew
ale expected per St. Osyth, leaves the market
still bare of that article, and enhances the
value of the small quantity in second
hands. At auction, this morning, Messrs.
Bradley, Newton, and Lamb disposed of a
quantity of Honolulu and colonial ration
sugars at from £24 10s. to £29 03.
Tho Stock and Share marlcet was quiet but
firm. Joint Stock Bank advanced to 13|-;
National of Queensland sold at 5 J ; ""Wallsend
Coal were in request and brought from 21^ to
21 jj. Tho late improvement in Peak Downs
was supported by sales at 93. t)d., 10s., and
9s. lOid. Star of Peace Gold wero done at
3s. Gd., and wanted, Lion Reef brought 5d.
to S£d. ; Hustler's Tribute, 9a.
Mr. Threlkeld will hold a large sale of oil
men's stores, &c, to-morrow,
Messrs. Griffiths and ""Weaver report the sale
of 7000 store wedders on account of Mr. J. B.
Bettington, Merriwa, at 7s. per head.
The report of the sale of the Great Britain
Tin Company's products yesterday should
have been 100 tons of metal at £74, and 60
tons ore at £40 per ton,
The abstracts of Revenue Receipts and
Expenditure for the quarter and year ending
31st December, published this evening as a
Supplement to the Government Gazette, are a»
satisfactory documents as any colonial Go-
vernment has had the good fortune to submit
to the public. They more than bear out
the anticipations of the Treasurer, and the
more recent calculations of his locum tenons.
Taking the paet quarter's statement, we find
that it yielded £1,280,412 on account of
Revenue Proper, being an increase of £142,920
on the corresponding portion of 1874. Tha
land revenue alone contributed within a frac-
tion of £140,000 of that amount, and
Customs £5002, which Avas entirely
due to an improvement of £7833
in Murray River duties compensating
for a falling off in the receipts at this port.
The only other important decrease was £3315
in gold and mint receipts, for we can hardly
class the sum of £24,974 stated as a decrease)
in stamps as coming under that designation,
there being no Stamp Act. Railways show an
increase of £13^652 ; the Post Office and
Telegraph departments adding a further
sum of £9108 to the credit side. Turning
li' the year's account the aggregate receipts for
consoli«lnt<wl vovennp axe found to amount to
£4,126,300, against £3,514,314 for 187i, or a

.-O""
By a Stoaxobr.
Tho week in the Acsembly has not been a pleasant
one for tho Government. Two counts-out, not much
progress with business, and the summary rejection by a
largo majority of tho sohomo for coltibt-ating tho cen-
tenary of the colony, aie matters which can scarcely
bo regarded by Ministers with satisfaction, and it ia
doubtful if even the return from the Council
of the Customs Duties Bill -without omondmont has
been sufficient consolation. To the Opposition tho dif-
ficulties which have beset the occupants of the Treasury
benches have boon matters for congratulation, but
among themselves only. In the House thero have
been visiblo on the Opposition side of the Chamber a
discreetness and self-control which have discountenanced
any open demonstration of satisfaction, and havo indi-
cated bettor organisation and groater strength among
the opponents, of the Government than havo been ap-
parent at any previous time during tho session.. Even
tho victory over the Government on the centenary reso-
lutions was unaccompanied by a single cheer, and
yet there woro among the victors men who at other
times of far loss importance havo cheorod the result to
tho echo. Appearances certainly indicate that tho
Opposition aro somowhat stronger than thoy have been,
and the Government correspondingly weaker.
It may bo, however, that thoso appearances aro to a
certain extent deceitful, and that the empty benches
which during the last foTV days have boen very con-
spicuous on the Ministerini side of tho Houso have
boon duo, not to n withdrawal of support from
tho Government, but to tho absonce of members from
feelings of weariness at the length of tho session.
Undoubtedly, Ministerial supporters, in common with
most other persons, aro tired of tho manner in which
the session bns boon prolonged, and for soveial days
past it has boon very difficult for the Government to
keep n quorum of members oither inside the Chamber
or about' tho building. It is a significant fact, also,
that since the passing of the railway lesolulions many
members have disappeared.
Monday's sitting, which tho Premier had declared
to be absolutely necoesary for the rapid despatch of
business, produced very littlo moro than what must
havo beon to Sir Patrick Jennings an inconvenient dis-
cussion upon the Neyv Hobrides quo3tiou and his
rocont speech at the French Club, and thoh an early
count-out. There was just timo for tho Opposition,
when tho Estimates weio brought forward, lo raiso
the cry of rotienehment, and for Sir Henry Paikes to
movo tho reduction of tho Speaker's slaary i rom £1500
to £1200, and then 'attention being called to the
absence of a quorum, the proceedings carno suddenly to
an end.
Tuosday yvas somowhat bettor so far as the atten-
dance of mombors yvas concerned, but almost as barren
of good results. The attempt to reduce tho salary of
the Speaker, and another to nogative altogether an itom
representing the wages of a stableman, wero topics of
discussion for hours. No consideration was shown
by some members for either tho Spoaker or the
stableman. The high qualifications necessary for the
position of Speaker, and the closo attention to the dutios
of his offico whioh ho must uncoasingly shoyv, yvero in
tho eyes of those hon. gentlomon matters of no moro
significance than tho fact that tho stableman had boen
omployod for years, and that tho sudden withdrawal of
his ivagea would probably reduce him and his wife and
family, if ho havo thom, to the vergo of starvation.
Mr. O'Connor was interesting on tho subject
of tho Speaker, and tho Speaker was very sovore
on thoso tvIio dosiiod to get rid of tho stableman.
"" Wo must,"" said Mr. O'Connor, "" havo a man
of high attainments in tho chair. Wo can
do with nn ignorant member of Pailiament, and wo
can do yvith a mediocre Minister of tho Oroivn-wo
have, unfortunately, many of both-but wo cannot do
for five minutes with an indifferent Spoaker. no must
bo a man of great mind, a man of great power, a man
of great qualities,"" ""And,"" said tho Spoaker later on,
when tho question of tho stabloman's wages Avas being
considered, and ho had pointed out that tho item had
been on tho Estimates for tho last 20 years, ""if
numbors aie not entitled to have a mau to look af ter their
horses, thoy aro not ontitled to have a man to pump
up water for their baths, and thoy had better go and
pump up water for themselves."" The possibility of
boing reduced to this necessity decided the matter, and
tho stablomun was saved by a majority of 2S to 0,
ono of thoso who voted for him consoling himself tvith
the audibly-oxpressed lolloction-""I might havo a
buggy myself some day.""
Now and then during tho sitting there Avas somo
contention bolweon members, which, though to a
certain extent amusing, was not very odifying.
Sir Henry Parkes seamed to bo vory fond
that night of contrasting tho oxtravaganco
of tho present Government Avith tho economy
of his Ministry of four yunrs ago, and of courso Mr.
Dibbs lost no opportunity for answoring him. "" Tho
lion, member,"" said the Colonial Socrotary, "" is never
tired of tolling us of his gi oat Administration, never
tired of boating his own drum. Every I bing has gone
to tho devil sinoo tho lion, gentleman loft office.""
"" Hear, hear,"" said Sir Henry Parkos, emphatically ;
""It has gono to Dibb3 and tho devil,"" ""Tho lion,
mombor."" continued Mr. Dibbs, tvithout noticing this
rejoinder, ""says all this has boen done sinco ho was in
offico four years ago."" ""It is moro than four yeirs
ago,"" said Sir Henry Parkes. .' And it tvill
ha moro than four yoars,"" returned Mr. Dibbs,
""beforo you como baok."" ""I am not so suro
of that,"" said Sir Henry Parkes ; "" at all
events I don't want to go hack,"" "" At all events,"" in-
terjected Mr. G. A. Lloyd, for tho bonofit of Mr. Dibbs,
"" you are leaving n nice legacy for him,""
Mr. Abigail said a smtvit thing during tho Avook,
somewhat to the disconifituro of Mr. Molvillo, but
greatly to the amusement of everybody elso. Whilo
tho mombor for Northumberland was in tho midst of a
speech attacking tho loader of tho Opposition, ho was
interrupted by somo laughter at his using tho
woid ""horotoforo"" tvhen it tvas obvious that
ho monnt ""horoaftor."" Ile stepped to inquire
of a momber silling near him what tho Houso
was laughing at, and Mr. Lovion endeavoured toholp
lum out of his difficulty hy suggesting that ho pro-
bably meant "" tho sweet by-and-byo."" "" No,"" said Mr.
Molvillo, ""what Unshod into my mind just then was
one of tho hon. mombor for West Sydnoy's quotations
from Hamlet"" "" Mi,'.' remarked Mr. Abigail, in-
stantly, from whoro ho was sitting on tho back Opposi-
tion bondi, "" That must havo boon tho gravoyard
scene.''
Colonol Holboww appoarod lo bo o*]unlly smart,
though in anothor way, Avith Iho Coloniul Socrotary on
Wednesday. Tho iiou. member, who is very seldom
seon in tho Assombly, movoii the adjournmont of tho
Houso, to call attention to the manner in whioh pro-
motions aro mado in tho Volunteer Force ; and speak-
ing of Mr. F. A. Wright, who, bo said, bad beon
promoted Bovoral times without examination, ho
declared that Mr. Wright tvns lying quiotly by on tho
unattached list until ho could ho mado a colonel
commanding a rogimcut. "" I havo no doubt,""
the lion. member for Argyle nroooodod.
"" judging from what ' has ' taken place lately,
that if it had been po^siblo he would have been placed
in command Of the Third, for that position his been
made rathor hot for tho officer commanding the regi-
ment."" "" Who is in command of the Third? "" askod
Mr. Dibbs, apparently in tho moBt natural manner con-
ceivable, though in reality it was difficult to judge'whe-
ther the question waa put innocoiitly or by design. "" Tho
officer,"" replied Colonel Holborow, "" to whom you gavo
a position in tho Soudan Contingent, and then insulted
by saying ho was not tit to command theie."" "" What
is his name ? "" asked Mr. Dibbs ; again, as it scorned,
quite naturally. "" OolonoliIIolborow,"" yvas the reply,
instantly folloyvod by Opposition cheers. But Mr.
Dibba, after all, soomod to have the best of it, for
ho quiotly remarked, ""You are airing your own
grievance.""
Tho delay in the progress of business, which has
beon a promincut feature throughout the presont session,
has boen due to sovoral causes, but among theso the
unusual mannor in which the Govornmcnt sometimes
lead the Assembly is not the loast noticeable. On two
nights during tho prosent week Sir Patrick Jennings
has been absent from tho House almost from tho timo
it has mot, but whenever the Premier is not in attoud
nnco Government business is understood to be in charge
of tho Colonial Secretary, Mr. Dibb3. It was in this
position apparently on Wednesday night, for tho Premier
had gone away, and Mr. Dibbs proceeded with his
Civil Servico Bill. ""Whon that matter had boon dis-
posed of, it bocamo necessary to postpono tho Premier's
Centenary resolutions. Mr. Abigail, of courso, wanted
some explanation of the postponement, and it yvas the
duty of Mr. Dibbs lo give it. Instead, howovor, of tho
Colonial Secretary rising to explain, Dr. Itemvick
approached the tablo, and said it had been tho
intention of the Premier to go on with tho motion,
but certain information had not been furnished
to bim, and the postponement was therefore
necessary, "" But,"" said Sir Henry Parkes, "" ive ought
to know that from tho Premier himself."" "" Tho
Premier,"" said Dr. Fumwick, *' is not present, and ho
has authorised me to mako tho statemont"" "" What
aro we going to do then ?"" a=kod the Opposition.
""Wo are going on with tho Estimates,"" said Dr.
It. nwick; and aflor making that announcement ho
gave place to Mr. Dibbs.
The business of tho weok closod last night yvith tho
lesumed debate upon the Divorce Extension Bill. This
measure is not ono that should be treated yvith lovity ;
but Mr. O'Connor could not refrain fiom malting the
House laugh, though ho had »o intention of dealing
with tho bill in any way than vory seriously. Mr.
Garland interrupted him, and Mr. O'Connor, turning
upon him, obborvod, ""Tho lion, member should road
Tvhat the greatest philosopher and poet that ever livod
has said,
"" ' How oft the sight of means to do ill-deods
Makes ill-deqds doua !' ""
"" That,"" said ho, "" is Shakespeare ; I'll guarantee it's
authentic ; I'm perfectly aure there's nothing Abigailian
about it."" Then yvnxing warm, and in his warmth
becoming, as ho occasionally docs, somoivhat unintelli-
gible, ho went on to say that "" the men who yvould
voto for this bill would put into operation a measure
which yvould make this colony not o great colony of
England or of tho British Empire, but would convort
it into a colony of Utah."" Probably ho meant a com-
munity of Mormons instead of "" a colony of Utah,""
and it is not surprising that somo member, noticing
the slip, laughed a dorisivo ""Ha, ha, ha! "" ""Ha, ha,
hal "" ropoited Mr. O'Connor, indignantly, "" tho largest
barrel sounds tho loudest""",The Sydney Morning Herald ,"432,161,263,811,846,848,849,847,847,846,845,843,846,844,843,843,843,844,845,841,841,843,844,844,842,843,842,685,809,846,847,844,845,845,841,844,845,843,843,845,842,845,405,809,847,846,846,847,849,846,850,848,848,847,848,107,812,847,849,848,849,848,848,848,848,848,848,848,848,847,786,813,848,845,846,849,846,848,846,848,846,844,846,846,847,847,845,845,847,845,843,845,846,394,811,846,846,847,847,847,844,845,848,847,847,844,842,842,847,846,846,847,844,844,846,845,843,622,807,845,845,845,845,843,846,845,844,842,844,842,844,843,843,844,843,104,802,843,841,841,844,844,840,842,843,843,843,843,856,863,860,862,861,862,860,860,860,859,861,862,857,858,860,862,167,821,859,861,860,860,861,860,848,858,857,859,858,854,858,854,856,855,856,855,856,857,859,857,857,858,861,856,853,858,382,821,860,859,862,860,860,861,864,863,126,657,364,862,862,860,863,865,863,862,865,865,864,863,864,869,415",Sat 25 Sep 1886,"1677,1730,1763,1830,1868,1905,1944,1980,2018,2054,2093,2130,2168,2206,2243,2280,2318,2356,2395,2430,2468,2507,2543,2581,2618,2656,2693,2731,2769,2806,2843,2881,2918,2955,2993,3031,3068,3106,3143,3180,3217,3255,3294,3330,3367,3406,3443,3480,3517,3555,3593,3630,3668,3704,3740,3781,3816,3854,3892,3928,3966,4003,4041,4079,4116,4154,4191,4228,4265,4303,4341,4378,4416,4453,4490,4528,4566,4603,4640,4679,4715,4753,4791,4828,4865,4902,4940,4977,5014,5052,5090,5127,5164,5202,5239,5276,5314,5351,5389,5426,5464,5501,5538,5576,5614,5651,5689,5726,5764,5800,5839,5875,5913,5950,5988,6025,6062,6100,6143,6181,6218,6255,6293,6330,6368,6406,6443,6480,6516,6554,6591,6628,6665,6703,6739,6777,6815,6852,6889,6921,6963,7002,7038,7075,7112,7150,7187,7224,405,444,482,519,556,598,628,669,711,745,780,820,856,894,932,974,1015,1044,1082,1121,1159,1196,1234,1270,1308,1347,1382,1421,1456,1494,1532,1571,1609,1646,1682,1720,1757,1795,1833,1871,1907,1945,1982,2020,2057,2096,2137,2171,2207,2247,2284,2321,2358,2396,2435,2472,2515,2547,2581,2615,2653,2693,2728,2768,2807,2843,2882,2919,2955,2992,3029,3069,3109","2343,2414,2429,2173,2137,2135,2136,2138,2136,2137,2138,2139,2136,2138,2138,2137,2138,2138,2136,2138,2136,2136,2134,2135,2136,2135,2134,2134,2170,2133,2132,2134,2133,2132,2133,2133,2132,2133,2133,2133,2133,2132,2132,2169,2131,2132,2132,2131,2130,2131,2129,2130,2130,2132,2130,2130,2166,2131,2129,2130,2130,2129,2129,2129,2129,2129,2128,2128,2129,2128,2127,2163,2127,2126,2127,2125,2126,2124,2125,2124,2124,2123,2123,2123,2121,2121,2121,2121,2120,2120,2121,2119,2119,2118,2154,2119,2118,2119,2118,2118,2118,2119,2118,2118,2118,2118,2120,2119,2118,2118,2118,2118,2118,2120,2119,2120,2120,2122,2156,2121,2120,2120,2121,2121,2120,2120,2121,2120,2121,2120,2120,2120,2120,2120,2119,2118,2154,2118,2119,2118,2117,2116,2120,2116,2116,2115,2114,2113,3017,3014,3015,3014,3016,3016,3016,3016,3017,3017,3016,3016,3018,3017,3018,3017,3019,3057,3018,3019,3019,3019,3019,3020,3021,3021,3023,3022,3022,3026,3023,3026,3024,3025,3026,3024,3022,3023,3022,3022,3022,3022,3020,3021,3023,3021,3019,3058,3019,3019,3017,3019,3017,3018,3015,3016,3017,3114,3160,3018,3017,3017,3016,3015,3015,3016,3016,3014,3015,3016,3015,3013,3014",13634999,Page 11

Íiofcd In January, 1864, I saw Miss Dickson at Mait
iind, and lent hci some money , she had requested mo on
several occasions to advance her monoy on her horses, which
, she I lion had m Maitland, I think there worofivo, tho horses
1 paw were Zenobia, Kildare, lind Rockingham,, I did not
sec Stratford and Snrsfiold then , I refused sovonil times to
ndvauco monoy lo hoi, but having at lost consented 1
advanced her £230 in Mr Mullen's oflico thoro was pre-
viously drawn a bill of sale on the horsos , the document
pioduccd is that signed in my presence
By Mr Isaacs 1 ho names of tho horses had been filled
in when MIES Dickson signed the document, Mr Mullen,
MIKS Dickson, and my seit were present, Miss Dickson at
tho tuno said sho was in haste te got back to Sydnoy, and
we met bv appointment ut Mr Mullen's office, between 1
and 2 o clock of the day on which it was oxocutod
I had a portion of the monoy on mo and drew a chequo for
the balance , I w ent out of the oflico to tho bank boforo thobill
was executed, but it was not signed by Miss Dickson whilst
I was away at this timo I believed tho horses were at
Grancv s, Hunter R v cr Hotel, East Maitland , and I
believe she afterwards took them to Sydnoy, on tho third
psgo of the bill of salo thoro is a receipt, the signature to
thal and to tho bill wore signed at tho samo timo in tho pre-
sence of Mr Mullon and rnysolf, I boheve Mr Mullen
rend over tho document to Miss Dickson before sho signed
it
Bv Mr Bu 1er She mentioned fo mo the horsos , thoy
woio thoso then at Maitland , she luid the nnmeson a slip of
paper I know Rockingham, Zenobia, and Kildare, and
saw thrm at Maitland moro than once when negotiating
with her, sho was racing thom there, the money
was lepavablo m four months, when tho bill
of snlo fell due, she brought the (ho horses
to Maitland (Rookiugham, Zenobia, Kildare, Sara
field, and Stratford) to deliver over to me, she told mo
she was not ablo to meet tho bill of salo, and had brojght
the horses up to dohverover, and to roihse upon them,
how over, sho begged of mo not to sell them then, as races
wero coming off in Queensland, and if I would allow hw tj
take them there and make hor another adv ance, she thought
they would havoagood chance of winning, and probabh
put hci in a position to pay the amount of tho bill, I at
first refused, hut ovontnailj consented , tho further advtuico
made the sum up to £300, tho balanco wa3 £40 odd she
ÇTv c Mr Mullen and my solf a promissory note, dated ¿6th

Bv Mi Bullei I received this letter before miking tho
further advance, and when she got tho advance she took the
hoifes to Queensland , I saw herat Maitland on hci retutti
fie ni Queensland, about the 19th or 20th Septembor, 1804 , sho
a ked mc if the horses wore brought up norn Sydney, and
?wlelbci 1 waa going to sell them, as I bad possession of

mid Ivockinglmni I told her 1 should »eil them next dav
nt noon unless sho lound the money to releiso them sho
siid she would endcov oui to get tho money by 10 o clock
next morning but failed and when the timo of salo c uno
sho askea me as a fin our lo put up tho horses in ono lol, as
if separated she would have no chanco of getting them ,
wlitn they weresoldthey woio bought in for me (through
Mi YVndo) at her request, she stutiug that sho would find
the money to pay for them in a week, they wero bought in
at £405, and nt this time there was due to mo nearly
£500, I believe sho soon,after went to Svdnoy, I
received two letters (produced) from Mess Dickson, and
?wrote an answer to the first, Ihiivo received no portion
of tho money up to tho present ümo, whon the bill
of salo wns drawn I askod her if tho horses wero her own
bona fide property , sho said "" Thoy are, Mr Y'oomans, so
help mo-"" , I asked her if any person hnd a prior claim,
lion, ormortgago over thom, and she said no, sho gavo
the samo answer to Mr Mullen , I saw a slip or memo
randuni with the names of the horses on it boforo the bill of
sale was oxecutcd, it was given to Mr Mullen for the
purpose of inserting tho names in tho hill of salo, I do not
know « hat becamo of it after Mr Mullon took it down
stairs to his clerk, it was m Miss Dickson's hnndwrttinjr,
and I believe sho gave it to Mr Mullen
By Mr Isaacs Mr Mullen said he had no (uno
to moko search for any prior hen upon tho horse»,
Miss Dickson being in a hurry to got to
Sydnov , it might havo been between 12 and
1, or 1 and 2 o clock, I cannot recollect exactly,
I bolievo the bill of sale was signed on tho 8th January , I
do not recollect Miss Dickson sa ing she was in a hurry to
catch tho steamer at Morpeth , I saw Mr Mullen put his
signature to tho hill of salo ns a witness , Miss Dickson did
not then, that I am aware, sign any other document thau
the bill of sale and receipt, tho note produced (dated 26th
October) is in reference to the accommodation given mo by
Mr Mullen, tho othcrnotonow produced (dated28th August)
is in my handwriting on the day tho bill of salo was
signed I saw Miss Jhckson at Granoy e, East Maitland ,
I had some con\els,ntion with Dr Dickson then, ho
thanked mo for lending the money to his dauehtei , ho had
previously said I could take security over his daughters
horses , ho did not paitieularly montion tho names of any
horses , the simo day, or tho day following tho
execution ol the bill if sole, I saw Zenoni i Rockingham,
and Kildare as thev w oro being taken to Morpeth, thev
?were at Graney s door, the first tm e I saw the horses was
at Maitland races, I think I saw the smill slip of papor
containing tho names of the horses before Miss Dickson
gave it to Mr Mullen I saw the horses at Randwick, but
never asked Miss Diekson to sell thom, I did not ni tho
saddling vnrd olfei £1000 for Zenobia and Kildare, she did
not on that ocuiMon tell me the horses wero not hera, Mrs
Dickson never churned tho horses until two or throe months
after they were put up to auction and tho first claim I
heard her make was sometime in November, sho did not to
mo claim them on tho night of the sale (Advertisement
handed to witness) Ihe horses were advortised to
be sold on the 22»d September, and this advertisement
might have appeared a day or two before, Mrs Dickson did
sot, the night boforo thoy w ero adv ertised for salo, chum
the horses as her own, the horses were bought in at the
solicitation of Miss Diekson, I havo sworn previously,
that ""tho horses woio bought in expressly foi Miss Dick
eon,"" and I gavo an explanation of that statement, in my
account I charged Miss Dickson a commission for the pur-
chase of the horses I considered I put thom up under tho
bill of sale, and that, therefore, I was entitled to a commis-
sion , I do not ehargo a commission to persons for whom I
do not buy , I did not nttempt to dony that I used thoso
words, 1 might have sworn at tho Insolvent Court that,
along with tho bill of sale, Miss Dickson gavo mo
a promissory note tor £243, which I discounted
at the bank, and which I had to take up,
Miss Dickson having failed to meet it, I did discount a bill
given mo by Mr. Mullen it was pay able at Maitland , I
do not think I ever discounted a bill given mo by Miss Dick-
son for £243 , I do not remember Miss Dickson giving mo
a bill for that amount, or a noto of hand , I wrote a note
requesting Miss Dickson lo lako up tho promissory noto
for £243 that Mr Mullon had given I might havo
charged 20 or 2o pel cent for the money I lent Miss Dick
eon , I havo a promissory noto from Mr Mullen, signed on
fho date of tho bill of sale , I havo no objection to produce
it, it was a matter of accommodation betweon Mr Mullen
and myself, Miss Dickson had nothing to do with it, the
first tune the horses carno into my stables was
m Septembor, and that was tho first timo I had
what I call possession, unless it waa whon they
were seized under the bill of sale at Queensland, I had
Rockingham, Zenobia, and Kildare, and received them from
Wilson, who brought thom from Queensland, Miss Dick-
son was not present then, when tho further advance was
made, in the fatter part of May, Miss Dickson said to mo,
as the horses were coming round the corner of Granoy's
house, ""There is Zenobia-there are your horsos,""
excepting In that way. Miss Dickson never dehvored the
horses to me, sho did toll mo whon the further advance
«as made that aho had brought tho horses for the purpose
of delivering them over to me, when they returned from

between Kildare and Volunteer.] It ia signed by Miss
Dickson ; tho body of it is my linndwriiing ; Mr. Clift
who is a party to the document, requested me to become
the stakeholder for a certain sum of monoy ; I have fre-
quently heard Miss Dickson «peak of this horso, and
never heard herFpeakof it as belonging to anyone olso.

Kildare washer property; I heard her say it was her horse.
This was the case for the Crown.
The counsel for the defenco having put in certain docu
u entoty evidence, colled the following witnesses :
Mnrv Louisa Wentworth Dickson deposed, I am the wife
of Dr. Dickson of Rockbrook, Coogee, and mother of the
drfendont ; thero is a settlement by which I havo a separoto
«.lota ; I first know Zenobia in 1801 ; aho was choson'from
a lot ot horses at Mr. Myland'«, on the Clarence River ;
«ho was bought for mo, and, I believe, paid for hy Dr.
Dickson ; my daughter had nothing to do with that ; it
was on the 12lh Augu&t, 1801 ; I nover gava or sold tho
horse to my daughter between that time and May, 1861 ;
my daughter acted as trainer of the horse ; I receivod two
thirds or the winnings of the horso during that period, and
gave bcr one-tbird ; the document produced (doted 10th
September, 1803) was executed on the day of tho
date ! ty my daughter. [This was an acknowledgment
that j Zenobia then entered to rim in a race
was tbo properly of defendant's mothor; and
that 'défendant had no right, tille, or interest in the
horfcj or authority to make solo.] I novor heard from Mr.
Y'eon.nns that Zenobia was included in tho bill of salo
before September, 18(54; I had no knowledge of it from
any cuo up to that time; I purchased Kildare on the 2nd
Febtuaiy, 1863, from my daughter. (Documont produced
purporting to bo receipt for purchase money, £110.) I did
not know from any ono previous to 22nd, Suptcmbor, 18(31,
that Kildare wos included in tho bill of sale to Mr. Yeo-
man*; my daughter told nie in September that Mr.
Yeomans bad entered the horses in the bill of solo, but that
she had given him no directions to do so ; I purchased
Rockingham from my daughter. (Documont put in pur-
porting to bo receipt for tho purohosc monoy,
dated 9th December, 1801.) It ¡B attestod by Dr.
Dickson; the money was paid; between Deconlbor,
1861, and January, 1864, I did not dispose
of cither Kildare or Rockingham to anyone ; for the pur-
poses of training tho horsos wero in my daughter s manual
possession ; my daughter had farms near Liverpool, and
had a good many horses there ; I had nothing to do with
Sarsfield. Stratford, and Areola, or tho other horses oxcept
those I have mentioned; thoy wero my daughter's; in
September, 1864, I went to Maitland and saw Mr. Yeoman«
at Campbell'« Hill where I claimed tho horse» ; Mr.
Mullen must have heard me j ho was within hearing eba
attcndod at tho salo of the horses ; I went to Mr. Mullen's
lieuse tho evening before the sale : Mr. Mullen, myself, and
Dr Dickson were present when I told Mr. Mullen that
the horses Zenobia, Kildare, and Rockingham were mino ;
1 insorted in tho Maitland Jircrctir}/ the advertisement pro-
duced, November 9th, 1861 (a caution not to purchase tlio
thrco racehorses in question) ; tho initials of mynamoaro
wroug : I was in Maitland again on tho Ulk
November, 1861 ; I nevor signed a promissory note
to Mr. Mullen for £260 for the costs of an action by my
daughter against O'Mcaghor ; I signed a promissory noto
for that amount to Mr. Mullen, but not for costs of an
action which I never hoard of, and Mr. Mullen nover men-
tioned thom t» mo ; it was given in connection with tho
salo of the horses Sarsfield, Stratford, and othors ; Mr.
Mullen said ho would draw mo a bill of salo over tho horses
if I would fgivo a promissory noto for tho amount; the
horses were bought in for mo ; I did not got any of tho
horses, and tho noto was not paid ; Mr. Yeomans took mo
up from tho Courthouse to Campbell's Hill, tho boy Norton
being with us ; Mr. Mullen said ho was going to delivor tho
horses (Zonobia, Rockingham, and Kildare) ; on tho llth
Nov i ml or Mr. Yeomans said ho would drag us in tho miro,
that my daughter was a-villain, and that if I olaimed
tlio horses ho -would put a bullet through tho mare's hoad ;
about tho 30th, I remember that Zenobia, Rockingham, and
Kildare were taken to Queensland ; thoywero ontercd six
weeks before any raco ; I remember thom returning ; tlioy
were recoiled by ino. [Document tendered purporting to
bo n notico by Mr. Pennington to Mr. Yeomans, that llio
horses, then about being ottered for sale, wore tho property
of Mrs. or John Dickson.] That notice was authorised by
mo ;' I saw it on tho 26th September.
By Mr. Butler ; One of these documents was signed by
Jumes Robinson (receipt for £100 on account of Miss
Dickson) ; ho was confidential servant to my daughter, and
was onco in my employment ; I saw him last about twelve
months ago in Sydney ; I bought Zonobia when a filly
from Mr. Mylnn of tbo Clarence River ; I heard that ho had
geno' to Queensland ; I had a caso at the Polico Court
ogoinstMr. Gibb for horso-stealing, Zonobiu being ono of
the homes, and I did not then endeavour to bring Mr.
Mylan down as a witness in that prosecution ; Hib
bei d (who also put his uamo to one of tho documents)
bus gone to Braidwood ; I havo tried to got him as a wit-
ness ; ho was a servant of mine for a long timo and became
s jockey ; he was called na a witness at tho Polico Court
«hen 1 was prosecuting Gibb ; I havo only theso threo
raco htrses ; my daughter had Stratford, Sarsfield, and
ninny other horses; I should say about twenty ; I never
bought any but theso three, and nover raced any other
horses ; 1 raced theso threo horses through my daughter,
ns their trainer; they were raced in my daughter's namo ;
I think my daughter had a racchorso in 1860 ; 1 did not,
Lcforc that, enter a horse for a race, nor did I keep a racc
hoiso before tbnt ; I did not tnko putt in theso races at all ;
1 paid the expenses; my daughter como into my employ-
ment, as trainer, in 18G3; sho had read a groat doal on i
horses, and took to training them; I bought the horses
fiorn her, and then employed her totraiuthem; in 1863,
for tho first tinto in my life, T speculated with horsos on tbo
turf; I informed Mr. Billyard that the monoy ho was pay-
ing mo was tho price of a racchorso ; ho had nothing to do
but to hand over tho monoy to my daughter ; Mr. Billyord
wos my solicitor; I think that is tho only monoy he ever
paid on my account ; ho was holding manoy on my trust
estate, and I gave my daughter an order upon him ; in my
converfiilicns with Mr. Yeomans and Mr. Mullen
I never produced ono of tho documents referred
to, but I told them the horses were mine; tho
Mr. Terka who is montioned in one of the
documents, is a warehouseman in Sydney, and is my
trustee ; ho was not consulted about this documont ; ha
krew nothing about if,"" I informed him in November, 1861,
of the- agreement to purchase tho horso ; about tho timo, or
before 1 clnimcd tho horses ; I told him then, because I
wanted on assignment to bo made to sond up to Maitland ;
the horses wero brought back from Queensland in Soptoin
ler, and in that month my daughter told mo tho horsos had
been jmt into a bill of salo by Mr. Yeomans without her
consent; 1 heard that Mr. Gibb had tnkon them to Mait-
land ; 1 did not nrosccutc him thon because I wantod a
witness to prove that he took them ; Miss Dickson and Dr.
Dickson went up in the steamer with the horses ; 1 did not
>ce Mr. Gibb until I saw hin? at Newcastle; I saw tbo
horses on board, and saw AVilson and some of our servants in
elim gc of them ; I did not seo the horsos removed from tho
steamer, nor did I inquire what tho horses woro
coing to Maitland for ; no ono told mo that
Wilfcn was in charge of tho horses ; AVilson
did not tell me that Mr. Gibb was on board ;
our own two servants (Norton and Kerr) wero with tho
boites ; I did not see any person in charge ; the two boys
were with Hiern on deck ; I did not ask the boya where they
were taking them; I knew they wero on board before I
vi mt on boord ; that was the reason I went on board ; I
krew they were at Martyu's ; 1 v-.nt down to soo them on
:be Sunday ; when 1 got to Maitland I v. ;nt to Mr. Yeo
nirns to claim tho noises; I left thom on board the
-tramer ; not finding Mr. Yeomans at home I went to Mr.
Mullen's- 1 had heard they wero brought up to Eckford'«
Mollies ; I went to Maitland on tho 19th September, and on
ibu 20th or21sl went to Eckford'a Hotel and claimed tho
boires there ; I met Mr, Yeomnns on tho road nnd claimed
the horses from him ; I was up at Maitland attending a
nisi in which O'Mengher was concerned ; the document
(l reduced) is a promissory noto I gave to Mr.
Mullen to purchaso tho bill of enid for mo
In m 'Mr. YcomanR, and not to pay for costs ;
I pavo it after the bill of sale was purchased ; it was sold
ivn i he 22nd, and I gave that on the 23rd ; I think tho bill
»i tnlo-wns sold to fir. AVado ; tho horses wero knocked
down to him ; I understood from Mr. Mullen that he had
pi.i chased the bill sf solo forme, and that I would got the
hc/uos at 4 o'clock that day; on tho evening of the 21st
I íirked him to purchafo the bill of salo for mo, and to give
n.c up my horses ; I had then heard that the three horses
w err-included in the MU tf sale; I told bim thoywero
n ino that they were wronirly in the bill of solo, ond
icsiiuctcd him to purchaso them, and ho undertook to do
¡i : Dr. Dickson was present at this agreement with Mr.
Mullen ; I did not give tho promissory note to Mr.
O'Kcefu expressly on Ino score of costs; after I signod it
1 t'nvo it back to Mr. O'Keofo; Mr. O'Keefe saw mo
at (ho Court ; ho might havo told mo that Mr.
Mullen could not keep his appointment with me ;
Lut he did not say he was sent to get from mo
tho i romissory noto for costs ; I did not complain that tho
account of costs was too high, nor did ho explain to mo
be w they came to be so high ; I did not sign the promissory
note on account of costs, and had no interview with Mr.
Mullen about the costs ; I never gave instructions to draw
out the promissory noto for costs ; I did not ask that tho
buses should be bought in for my daughter, about the
<nmo,tiinc that I claimed them as my own; I asked for
thini to pay her own debt; I did not at Eckford'« on tho
n.nniing of tho sale ask Mr. Mullen to buy in tho horses for
mc, as I did not like my daughter to loso her horses, and
that I had mortgaged property in Victoria to pay for the
put (hace; lho evening before, I did ask him to buy in the
bil! rif sale for me, and ho said ho would ; he did not at
Frkford's refuse to buy Hiern for mo; I was present at an
intei view with Mr. Jenner and my daughter ; I askod him for
£-ICO, stating that I would put tho horses in his possession
until 1 iHtid him ; I asked him to lend mo the £400, to got
the hones from Mr. Yeomans, as I did not admire his con-
duct to her; I (old Mr. Jenner they were roy horses ; my
daughter nover said in my presence to Mr. Jenner that thby
i wcic her horses; nor did I say- to Mr. Jenner that thoy
i were my daughter's horses; I nover told Mr. Yeomans
I that t hey wero my daughter's horses, or write to him ask
[ ¡ngliini to postpone the salo; only one letter passed between
me nnd Mr. Yeomans, and in that I offered to pay my
dnucl.trr's debt to him on the horses ; I could not say that
in thal letter I said (ho horses belonged tome ; on tho samo
morning (hat that lotter was delivered, Mr. Chambers
claimed tbo horses as minc ; I do not recollect in that lotter
asking for a postponement of tho salo ; tho samo ovening;
I bad"" nn interviow with Mr. Yeomans, and he refused
to aectdo to what I proposed in the letter. (Tho
Iel ter dated 12th November was then read.)
Before that letter was dclivored I had actually
¡men Mr. Yeomans notico that tho horses wero mino; ho
i-nt'd he was about to sell tbo horses by privato sale; the Balo
bv auction was about the 22nd September ; on tho ovening
of the llth November I was sitting with Mr. and Mrs.
Eekfoid. when Mr. Yeomans said, "" Your daughter is a
gieat villain, I will drag her through tho mire, "" and used
other threatening languago ; Mr. Eckford said to mo
"" make an offer for the horses, and get Miss Dickson out of
Koilloi.d, for I am afraid she will bo murdered ; "" I thon
v\ioto that letter to Mr. Yeomans; the next evening Mr.
Yeomans commenced the samo abuse ; I told him the
limes wero mine, and that I would have them, and that I
l.rd paid Mr. Mullen £250 for tho bill of sale ; when tho
lirrfru were in Queensland I saw Mr. Solomons; I did not
tell him that my daughter and her horses were now out of
his power; instead ofthat I told him tho horses wero
minei I remember a conversation out at my place, when
Miss Dickson said, in Mrs. AVilson's presence, that sho had
reared up Zenobia on her farm.
By bia HONOR : The promissory noto was given on tho
23id September, and this letter was written somo timo after.

to get them out of John Solomons' way ; thoy woro to bo
stnblcd nt Maitland, and sent back to Sydney, then to bo

several interviews with Mr Yeomans, m tho )nrdatthe
Police Office, in S) duo), Mr Yeomans asked me to swoar that
he bad got i ossession of the horses on tho day the bill of sala
was executed, or otherwise, Solomons would get possession
of them, I refused to do so, and did not givo evidence to

wife could make, wo did mnke
B) (Mr Butler M) wifo is I behove on bail on a charge
of stealing theso horses, I did not seo the horses when thoy
were taken, I have seen them painted with oil, the family
is in mourning for my brother, who died the other da), I
do not remember that we were m mourning m 1863, after
Mr Yeomans lent ni) daughter the monc), he and I
were on intimate terms, ho asked mo in the Polico
vnrd to perjure mv self, I know Zenobia was entered for
the Queensland races-Zenobia, Kildare, Sarsfield Strit
fmd, and, I think, Rockingham, were up at those races
I renumber tho threo horses Zenobia, Kildare, and Hocking
ham going to Maitland in Ma) , Mr Solomons w«
n nkmg a claim here, and it was to get tho horses out of hu
wnv, nnd to save thom to complete (heir engagomonts in
Queensland, 1 was told that Mr Solomons w is on tho
v-baif to sei/o them , we actually passed tho horses close to
him, he was on the samo wharf where we shipped thorn
the) were brought back from Maitland to Sidney, and
shipjed ngnin for Queensland, I know tho object for which
the) wciosenttoMnitlnndwasnot to givo them into the
IosiCf-ion of Mr Yeomans, five went up to Miutlanl
seme of which were to be given up under tho bill
of sale, two of theso were Stratford and Sarsfield, these
three were not taken up to give to Mr Yeomans, 1 think
Mr Solomons sent a warrant up to Queensland, ia June I
thirk I first heard of the bill of sale, but I cannot tell pre
tiselv , I know Mr Solomons was claiming tho three horses
Zenobia, Kildare, and Rockingham, I behove ho claimed
ti cm en (he 24th of Ma) , I was not moro careful in taking
I hem awi), because I knew he had no just claim upon
Ibcin, 1 bchevo his was a most fraudulent transaction 1
will swear that two other horses wero removed at the time,
ro) daughter told mo tho names of these tbreo
horses were fraudulcntiv put into his bill of silo
b) Mr Solomons, I wrote to Mr Yeonmns, pro
posing that there should bo an assignment
of the bill of Bale to trustees for my wifo and daughter, i
did not write for an assignment lo mv daughter, it is
probable I did for my wife, I said I wrote to Mr Mull«
for such on assignment [document produced purporting »
be the letter proposing such assignment], that is ni) nime,
I wrote the letter, tho assignment was to bo to mv wife,
Mr Mullen agreed on the receipt of tho promissory note ti
purchise the bill of salo, ho said about £300 waa duo I
disputed tho amount, and said there could bo nothing of tue
kind, I knew £2J0 was all she got from bim, I never knew
that £S0O was duo until September, at tho timo Ino pro
missorv note was excculed, Mr O Keefo said there »as
moro clue, but that would do now .
ByhlsHoNOit The £250 was to getpo^ei-sionoftue

Bv Mr Butlci Tor the £2j0 m) wife was to t«»
possession of the horses, I did not before that heir troni
mv daughter that she owed that amount I did not umu
September, hear that ni) daughter had giv on a pronu-sory
note for £300, I heard that she gave a promissory now
when the bill of salo was executed, it is probable that in
August I wrote to Mr Mullen a letter about this promu
sory note, I boliov o I received from a bank a letter in
August saying that ni) promissory noto was duo to soma
one in Maitland on behnlT, I believe, of Mr Mullen and
Mr Yeomans, I was completely token aback on receiving
it, and wrotoavory cautious reply, I remember wniing i

.-O""
By a Stoaxobr.
Tho week in the Acsembly has not been a pleasant
one for tho Government. Two counts-out, not much
progress with business, and the summary rejection by a
largo majority of tho sohomo for coltibt-ating tho cen-
tenary of the colony, aie matters which can scarcely
bo regarded by Ministers with satisfaction, and it ia
doubtful if even the return from the Council
of the Customs Duties Bill -without omondmont has
been sufficient consolation. To the Opposition tho dif-
ficulties which have beset the occupants of the Treasury
benches have boon matters for congratulation, but
among themselves only. In the House thero have
been visiblo on the Opposition side of the Chamber a
discreetness and self-control which have discountenanced
any open demonstration of satisfaction, and havo indi-
cated bettor organisation and groater strength among
the opponents, of the Government than havo been ap-
parent at any previous time during tho session.. Even
tho victory over the Government on the centenary reso-
lutions was unaccompanied by a single cheer, and
yet there woro among the victors men who at other
times of far loss importance havo cheorod the result to
tho echo. Appearances certainly indicate that tho
Opposition aro somowhat stronger than thoy have been,
and the Government correspondingly weaker.
It may bo, however, that thoso appearances aro to a
certain extent deceitful, and that the empty benches
which during the last foTV days have boen very con-
spicuous on the Ministerini side of tho Houso have
boon duo, not to n withdrawal of support from
tho Government, but to tho absonce of members from
feelings of weariness at the length of tho session.
Undoubtedly, Ministerial supporters, in common with
most other persons, aro tired of tho manner in which
the session bns boon prolonged, and for soveial days
past it has boon very difficult for the Government to
keep n quorum of members oither inside the Chamber
or about' tho building. It is a significant fact, also,
that since the passing of the railway lesolulions many
members have disappeared.
Monday's sitting, which tho Premier had declared
to be absolutely necoesary for the rapid despatch of
business, produced very littlo moro than what must
havo beon to Sir Patrick Jennings an inconvenient dis-
cussion upon the Neyv Hobrides quo3tiou and his
rocont speech at the French Club, and thoh an early
count-out. There was just timo for tho Opposition,
when tho Estimates weio brought forward, lo raiso
the cry of rotienehment, and for Sir Henry Paikes to
movo tho reduction of tho Speaker's slaary i rom £1500
to £1200, and then 'attention being called to the
absence of a quorum, the proceedings carno suddenly to
an end.
Tuosday yvas somowhat bettor so far as the atten-
dance of mombors yvas concerned, but almost as barren
of good results. The attempt to reduce tho salary of
the Speaker, and another to nogative altogether an itom
representing the wages of a stableman, wero topics of
discussion for hours. No consideration was shown
by some members for either tho Spoaker or the
stableman. The high qualifications necessary for the
position of Speaker, and the closo attention to the dutios
of his offico whioh ho must uncoasingly shoyv, yvero in
tho eyes of those hon. gentlomon matters of no moro
significance than tho fact that tho stableman had boen
omployod for years, and that tho sudden withdrawal of
his ivagea would probably reduce him and his wife and
family, if ho havo thom, to the vergo of starvation.
Mr. O'Connor was interesting on tho subject
of tho Speaker, and tho Speaker was very sovore
on thoso tvIio dosiiod to get rid of tho stableman.
"" Wo must,"" said Mr. O'Connor, "" havo a man
of high attainments in tho chair. Wo can
do with nn ignorant member of Pailiament, and wo
can do yvith a mediocre Minister of tho Oroivn-wo
have, unfortunately, many of both-but wo cannot do
for five minutes with an indifferent Spoaker. no must
bo a man of great mind, a man of great power, a man
of great qualities,"" ""And,"" said tho Spoaker later on,
when tho question of tho stabloman's wages Avas being
considered, and ho had pointed out that tho item had
been on tho Estimates for tho last 20 years, ""if
numbors aie not entitled to have a mau to look af ter their
horses, thoy aro not ontitled to have a man to pump
up water for their baths, and thoy had better go and
pump up water for themselves."" The possibility of
boing reduced to this necessity decided the matter, and
tho stablomun was saved by a majority of 2S to 0,
ono of thoso who voted for him consoling himself tvith
the audibly-oxpressed lolloction-""I might havo a
buggy myself some day.""
Now and then during tho sitting there Avas somo
contention bolweon members, which, though to a
certain extent amusing, was not very odifying.
Sir Henry Parkes seamed to bo vory fond
that night of contrasting tho oxtravaganco
of tho present Government Avith tho economy
of his Ministry of four yunrs ago, and of courso Mr.
Dibbs lost no opportunity for answoring him. "" Tho
lion, member,"" said the Colonial Socrotary, "" is never
tired of tolling us of his gi oat Administration, never
tired of boating his own drum. Every I bing has gone
to tho devil sinoo tho lion, gentleman loft office.""
"" Hear, hear,"" said Sir Henry Parkos, emphatically ;
""It has gono to Dibb3 and tho devil,"" ""Tho lion,
mombor."" continued Mr. Dibbs, tvithout noticing this
rejoinder, ""says all this has boen done sinco ho was in
offico four years ago."" ""It is moro than four yeirs
ago,"" said Sir Henry Parkes. .' And it tvill
ha moro than four yoars,"" returned Mr. Dibbs,
""beforo you como baok."" ""I am not so suro
of that,"" said Sir Henry Parkes ; "" at all
events I don't want to go hack,"" "" At all events,"" in-
terjected Mr. G. A. Lloyd, for tho bonofit of Mr. Dibbs,
"" you are leaving n nice legacy for him,""
Mr. Abigail said a smtvit thing during tho Avook,
somewhat to the disconifituro of Mr. Molvillo, but
greatly to the amusement of everybody elso. Whilo
tho mombor for Northumberland was in tho midst of a
speech attacking tho loader of tho Opposition, ho was
interrupted by somo laughter at his using tho
woid ""horotoforo"" tvhen it tvas obvious that
ho monnt ""horoaftor."" Ile stepped to inquire
of a momber silling near him what tho Houso
was laughing at, and Mr. Lovion endeavoured toholp
lum out of his difficulty hy suggesting that ho pro-
bably meant "" tho sweet by-and-byo."" "" No,"" said Mr.
Molvillo, ""what Unshod into my mind just then was
one of tho hon. mombor for West Sydnoy's quotations
from Hamlet"" "" Mi,'.' remarked Mr. Abigail, in-
stantly, from whoro ho was sitting on tho back Opposi-
tion bondi, "" That must havo boon tho gravoyard
scene.''
Colonol Holboww appoarod lo bo o*]unlly smart,
though in anothor way, Avith Iho Coloniul Socrotary on
Wednesday. Tho iiou. member, who is very seldom
seon in tho Assombly, movoii the adjournmont of tho
Houso, to call attention to the manner in whioh pro-
motions aro mado in tho Volunteer Force ; and speak-
ing of Mr. F. A. Wright, who, bo said, bad beon
promoted Bovoral times without examination, ho
declared that Mr. Wright tvns lying quiotly by on tho
unattached list until ho could ho mado a colonel
commanding a rogimcut. "" I havo no doubt,""
the lion. member for Argyle nroooodod.
"" judging from what ' has ' taken place lately,
that if it had been po^siblo he would have been placed
in command Of the Third, for that position his been
made rathor hot for tho officer commanding the regi-
ment."" "" Who is in command of the Third? "" askod
Mr. Dibbs, apparently in tho moBt natural manner con-
ceivable, though in reality it was difficult to judge'whe-
ther the question waa put innocoiitly or by design. "" Tho
officer,"" replied Colonel Holborow, "" to whom you gavo
a position in tho Soudan Contingent, and then insulted
by saying ho was not tit to command theie."" "" What
is his name ? "" asked Mr. Dibbs ; again, as it scorned,
quite naturally. "" OolonoliIIolborow,"" yvas the reply,
instantly folloyvod by Opposition cheers. But Mr.
Dibba, after all, soomod to have the best of it, for
ho quiotly remarked, ""You are airing your own
grievance.""
Tho delay in the progress of business, which has
beon a promincut feature throughout the presont session,
has boen due to sovoral causes, but among theso the
unusual mannor in which the Govornmcnt sometimes
lead the Assembly is not the loast noticeable. On two
nights during tho prosent week Sir Patrick Jennings
has been absent from tho House almost from tho timo
it has mot, but whenever the Premier is not in attoud
nnco Government business is understood to be in charge
of tho Colonial Secretary, Mr. Dibb3. It was in this
position apparently on Wednesday night, for tho Premier
had gone away, and Mr. Dibbs proceeded with his
Civil Servico Bill. ""Whon that matter had boon dis-
posed of, it bocamo necessary to postpono tho Premier's
Centenary resolutions. Mr. Abigail, of courso, wanted
some explanation of the postponement, and it yvas the
duty of Mr. Dibbs lo give it. Instead, howovor, of tho
Colonial Secretary rising to explain, Dr. Itemvick
approached the tablo, and said it had been tho
intention of the Premier to go on with tho motion,
but certain information had not been furnished
to bim, and the postponement was therefore
necessary, "" But,"" said Sir Henry Parkes, "" ive ought
to know that from tho Premier himself."" "" Tho
Premier,"" said Dr. Fumwick, *' is not present, and ho
has authorised me to mako tho statemont"" "" What
aro we going to do then ?"" a=kod the Opposition.
""Wo are going on with tho Estimates,"" said Dr.
It. nwick; and aflor making that announcement ho
gave place to Mr. Dibbs.
The business of tho weok closod last night yvith tho
lesumed debate upon the Divorce Extension Bill. This
measure is not ono that should be treated yvith lovity ;
but Mr. O'Connor could not refrain fiom malting the
House laugh, though ho had »o intention of dealing
with tho bill in any way than vory seriously. Mr.
Garland interrupted him, and Mr. O'Connor, turning
upon him, obborvod, ""Tho lion, member should road
Tvhat the greatest philosopher and poet that ever livod
has said,
"" ' How oft the sight of means to do ill-deods
Makes ill-deqds doua !' ""
"" That,"" said ho, "" is Shakespeare ; I'll guarantee it's
authentic ; I'm perfectly aure there's nothing Abigailian
about it."" Then yvnxing warm, and in his warmth
becoming, as ho occasionally docs, somoivhat unintelli-
gible, ho went on to say that "" the men who yvould
voto for this bill would put into operation a measure
which yvould make this colony not o great colony of
England or of tho British Empire, but would convort
it into a colony of Utah."" Probably ho meant a com-
munity of Mormons instead of "" a colony of Utah,""
and it is not surprising that somo member, noticing

Police force, prisonor having voluntarily surrendered him-
self at the Water Police station in answer to a warrant
issued against him. ID virtue of that warrant ho waa there-
upon charged with ombozzllng 10,250 postage, stamps of tho
valuo of £95, the property of nor Majesty, on the 30th May,
1865. He made DO reply in answer to the charge. After
taking evidence as to his arrest ho was remanded till Mon-
day next. Bau allowed, himself in £100, and two suroties
in £50 each.

where he was found at 1.30 this morning. Prisonor stated
that ho was robbed ef his hat, boots, and monoy, and that
he belonged to H. M. S. Challenger. He was admonished
and discharged.
Charles Artlelt appeared on summons to answer the
information of John Carlile Humphrey, whioh set
forth that defendant being a presiding officer within the
meaning of the Municipalities Act did, at a publio mooting
of electors for tho nomination of candidates for election as
councillors of tho municipality of Paddington, on the 5th
Fobruary last refuse to allow James Patriok Smith, an
elector of tho said municipality, to nominate the informant,
also an elector, and refused to accept tho nomination of
informant by James P. Smith, as a councillor of Lower
Paddington Ward against the form of tho statute. Mr.
M'Dcvitt, instructed by Mr. Williamson, appeared for
plaintiff ; Mr, R. Forster for defendant. It was admitted,
on the part of the "" defendant,; that he presided
as deputy returning officer in tho Lower Paddington
Word on tho occasion in question. John Davis, clerk
to the municipality deposed that Mr. Humphrey was not an
elector for the ward, and this ho admitted when askod by
defendant at the time of Domination. Ho was not refused
nomination before ho admitted this. John Carillo Humphrey
deposed that on the occasion in question he was nominated
by James Patrick Smith, and seconded by Mr. Hawkins ia
tho first instance, and next by Mr. Stone. Immediately ho
was proposod, defendant objected to receive his namo as
a candidate, and ho had put no question to him prior to tho
nomination ; but afterwards he said ho (complainant) was
not an elector of Lowor Paddington, or something to that
effect, and that therefore witness's nomination could not be
received. He (witness) scrsr. admitted; or said that he
was not an, elector of l>>wer Paddington, not, waa «
question on that point put to him. His nomination boing
refused, ho banned in a protest before tho proceedings
closed. Ho was an elector for tho municipality, but not for
the Lower Word. James Patrick Smith corroborated the
last «itness's evidence an to tho refusal to accept Mr. Hum-
phrey's nomination ; Mr. Davis sat next tho returning
officer, and Mr, Humphrey was on tho opposite side of tho
room. Mr. Humphrey did not to witness's kuowlodgo
admit (hat his qualification was no1 in the Lower Ward,
nor did ho think a question on that subject could
hsvo been put to Mr. Humphrey without him (wit
iirN-) bealing ii. George Hawkins, n ratepayer
who was present at the nomination mooting
referred to, deposed that Mr. Humphrey claimed
tho tight to lie nominated after tho proposal of his name was
seconded. Witness had a recollection of defendant saying
something relativo to plaintiff's qualification for the Lower
Word, when plaintiff protested defendant also said some-
thing to tho effect that ho was acting upon legal odvioo and
io the best of his judgment. Complainant did not speak to
defendant before ho was objected to, or not in witness's
hearing. Thero wero three wards in this municipality
Upper and Lower Paddington and Clonmore, and there
wero three councillors to each ward, one retiring annually.
No witness waa called for the dofonoo, The main point
involved, namely, whether or not a candidate having a
qualification in tho municipality, though not in the par-
ticular ward, waa eligiólo for nomination in the ward for
which ho bad no qualification. The 12th section of tho Act
provides "" That any elector may nominate any othor doctors
as candidates for election ss councillors."" Tho connsol for
tho plaintiff argued that "" any elector"" Implied any olector
of tho municipality, whilst for the dofonoo it was nrged
that any elector of the word in which the election occurred
was meant. Their Worships (Mr. Stenhouse and Mr. T.
Dangar) reserved their decision till to-morrow (Friday).",The Sydney Morning Herald ,"685,532,835,222,805,836,835,835,831,832,835,836,835,828,172,805,834,836,834,834,834,834,833,828,214,804,837,834,835,832,833,831,833,838,833,833,834,832,834,835,833,833,833,834,834,834,833,835,831,834,833,834,834,833,836,834,836,835,835,833,835,836,833,833,836,822,834,832,834,835,837,833,836,833,835,838,804,836,836,833,838,837,836,840,837,837,839,835,835,835,785",Fri 5 Apr 1867,"5203,5260,5293,5324,5355,5386,5417,5449,5480,5511,5542,5574,5605,5635,5668,5698,5730,5761,5792,5822,5855,5886,5918,5949,5981,6012,6043,6074,6102,6136,6167,6197,6229,6260,6291,6322,6353,6384,6415,6446,6477,6509,6539,6571,6602,6633,6664,6695,6726,6756,6788,6819,6849,6881,6913,153,184,214,245,277,308,340,372,399,433,463,496,526,557,587,619,650,680,711,742,772,804,834,866,895,926,959,991,1020,1053,1085,1114,1145,1177,1210,1238","1338,1490,1155,1154,1185,1154,1153,1153,1152,1152,1151,1152,1150,1151,1150,1182,1149,1149,1148,1150,1148,1148,1148,1147,1148,1178,1145,1146,1145,1145,1145,1144,1143,1142,1143,1142,1141,1140,1139,1139,1140,1139,1138,1137,1137,1137,1137,1137,1138,1136,1135,1135,1134,1135,1134,2045,2045,2044,2045,2045,2046,2043,2045,2046,2044,2045,2046,2044,2045,2044,2044,2044,2044,2045,2044,2042,2043,2044,2042,2043,2042,2042,2044,2042,2042,2043,2042,2043,2044,2042,2044",13137999,Page 2

¡The Trilurte has a letter from Matamoras, August 30th,
which says the success met with by the force under General
Escardero has encouraged the Liberals to fresh efforts, In
and about Carmargo there is now a good force of about 600,
and among them twenty-fivo to thirty officers, who have
served in the United States and the late Confederate States
airny. A second body of come 500 men ¡»fifteen railes from
Carmargo, and at other points south of that place there are
bodies of from 200 to 300 men. In all, there is a force of
2Í00 men, ready for the next blow to be struck. The next
movcrhent that will bo made will be down the Rio Grande,
tej attack this place. It will be made, before information
r reach the enemy, by a dashing attack. A forco
about 2000 could take this place. Some of
the troops in it will not fight. The French in these posts
db not number more than 10,000 men. ? The battalion of
the Legion is at Monterey, armed with rifles, on the road
leading to this place. This handful of mon could not aid
Matamoros in case of attack. Tho French gunboat*
I Tactigno arrived off the Roads, and now lies with tho rest
of the naval force under command of Captain Comet,

-[Tho entire corps of Liberals lying about the San Juan
Boiver has been put in motion, hut their »Ians are not
known. It maybe that they intend to attack this place at
once. Cortinas, after a good deal of insubordination, has
been forced into the traces. He is now acting as it in the
hope, spirit, and wish to do some deed of note. They say
he passed from the left bank of the Rio Orando with a
command estimated at from 4000 'to 5000 men and

A lai go audience assembled in tho Frosty terian Church,
Regent-slreot, Redfern, to hear Mr. H. A. Long, of Glasgow
G reen, deliver ono of tho serios of lectures which ho has
given in this city. Tho meeting was prosided overbythoHon.
Dr. Ronwick, who in thecourseof his introductory remarks
said Mr. Long had made his mark au an tinti-infidol
lecturer and preacher of the Gospel in Glasgow, and during
his stay in Australia he bad done his best to uphold tho
grand old Christian faith, and ho had spoken out boldly
against all forms of unbelief. In these days, said tho
speaker, when freedom of thought was so lnrgolypormitted,
sometimes that freedom ran into liconso ; nnd when they
considered what occurred occasionally in tho high places of
tho land, and among those who should know hotter, not
only in Parliament, but in other piucos, thoy should bo
glud to know that there wero men uko Mr. Long who
endeavoured to uphold the causo of truth and right. Tho
lecturer then delivered an address on the Hobrow word
"" Chabod,"" which, he pointed out, siemificd in tho English
language weight, substance, or glory, and wont on to show
that, as tho Israelites carno out of Egypt with plenty of
this world's goods in fho shape of jowols and cattlo, which
wits their substanco and their .glory, or their "" Chabod,""

SHIPS : THEIR DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION.
In connection with the Board of Technical Education,
Mr. Walter Reeks, teacher in naval architecture at tho
Technical College, and well known as a naval architect
in this city, delivered n lecture on tho above subject at the
lecture hall of tho School of Arts on Friday last to on
audience ' of over 300 persons. Aftor a few preliminary
remarks, in which the lecturer explained that in au
hour it was not possiblo to do moro than sketch
fho^merest outline of tho subject, ho went into
tho question of water and its lfflat'ton to ships,
treating at some length the element of resistance duo
to friction between the Water! and a ship's bottom, explain-
ing why copper is used for shoathing purposes, viz., on
account of its exfoliating purposes, and not ns is some-
times supposed, because it is too poisonous for weeds, &c.
to grow upon it. Other elements of resistance were ex-
plained by sketches on the blackboard, chiefly tho
disturbance of the water, known as wave making.
Floatation and stability woro spoken of and
illustrated in as lucid a manner as time permitted of. In
concluding Mr. Reeks ran through a list of the chief
considerations in ship-designing, and again reminded his
heuroi s of tho fact that ho had only touched on n very few
points of the subject, but said all these things would bo
worked out in detail at tho class in naval architecture of
tho Technical College in Sussox-street.

FLORENCE DIXIE.
. The attack on Lady Florcnco Dixie-or, as some of the
newspapers now put it, tho "" reported "" attack-is shrouded
In mystery. The firbt rumours -which reuched London on
IMarch 17 declaiou that Lady Florence had been stabbed to
death. Later accounts on tbe following (Sunday) morning
'averred that hor dress alono hud suffered Irotn thu knives of
'the miscreants ; and this it appears is the sum and substance
of tho injury done. Her ladyship, we are assured, has ex-
pressed lier regret that so much bus been made of the case ;
'but it wus tho sensational nurrativo supplied by herself, in
ilho first pluoe, that caused so much interest and excito
.inent, and led to a desire for further news respecting tho
? alleged outrage. Tho "" further news "" has suggested
the hypothesis that Lady Florence was only
beset by common, sturdy beggura and tramps,
,nnd that contusion, excitement, tbo eüecls of being slightly
. istunned, and the recent murders nnd explosions, combined
to afi'ect her imagination, and to colour (of course uncon
'eciously) her narrativa of events. The further the police
?pursue their investigations the moro thoy appcar.pujr¿led by
tho whole circumstances of tho case. They cannot account
for two such very tall men, dichsed, as one appears to have
been, in a striking costume of green, coming into such a
quiet country district without attiaetiug the attention
,of roany of tho country people. Nor can they ex-
plain tbo disappearance of the scoundrels from |
? the sceno eilhor byroad or river without being noticed j
'by many who could speak to the fact. Tho ground
""where the outrage nccuried has been carefully inspected, but
without iiiTorcling uny evidence of a struggle having taken
'place. Had a dog ot tho massive build of tho St. Bernard,
.Hubert, attacked a man, it is only concoivable that the sott
ïnould would ho toiu up, but thoro aro no evidence* of a
struggle cither at the bpot whero Lady Florence Dixie was
-thrown down, or anvwhoro near it. Again, the dog has been <
carefully looked to. but ho does not appear to ka ve a Bciatch, or
an injury of any kind. Lady Florence Dixie is reported to
have fully recovered fiom the shook occasioned hythe attack
'on her. No doctor has been called in to see hor ladyship, and
Sndecd his services would scarcely be required, na beyond tho
'slight wound in the hand thoro aro no traces of any injuries
either on the throat, where Lady Florence Dixio says one of
the miscreants caught hold of her, or on the head, where
ter ladybhip believes she received a blom It is indeed both,
fortunate and remarkable that Lady Florónos Dixio should
have clutched suoh a iormiduble weapon us a dagger with-
out inflicting any greater injury upon herself. The Home

was paylng-ofr towardB the shore, which was not very far distant.
An examination, mado at once, showed that the Resolute and her
rudder had parted company, leaving her in un almost helpless
condition in a very dangerous position. Signals of distress
were immediately hoisted, but the vessel was close in under th»
cliffs, and as it was only just breaking day it was feared on board
that they would not bo seen. These fears, however, were ground-
less, as the flags were noticed immediately from the signal station,
and the Captain Cook pilot steamer proceeded without delay to tua
assistance of the disabled vessel. In tho meantime the steamor
Civility, also owned by Mr. Hill and employed In the stone trade,
carno up, being inward-bound, and taking the Resolute Io ? to*r
brought her safely Into port. By tho time tho Civility ranged u_r
alongside the Resoluto the latter was very close to the rocks';
and It was only by sending the engines full speed astern almost
till the Civility caine up, and then full speed ahead and setting
the after canvas on her, that tho vestel got out of the difficulty
safely. Tho Resolute was taken to Mort's Dock to have a neir
rudder fitted. H or old rudder was picked up by the Captain Cook
and landed at the Government boatshed.

STATE OF THE CHINESE EMPIRE.
(By the Special Correspondent of the Overland China
Mail.)
HANKOW, 5th August, 1862.
THERE is nothing in the present aspect of affairs
which promises the dawning of a more peaceful day
upon this distracted land. Ten long years have
elapsed since the beginning of these commotions;
and, for aught we can see just now, ten or twenty
more are likely to follow ere they subside. Here
dynastic changes, like all other changes, move
on very slowly ; they generally take from twenty to
forty years for their consummation. There are
no reasonable grounds for hoping that this
will be accomplished within a shorter period. China
is what she has ever been—slow, stolid, stagnant;
and it is hardly fair to expect from her, in her dotage,
signs of greater life and vigour than she was wont to
display in the days of her much-vaunted strength. A
well-instructed Chinaman, reviewing the events of
ages gone by, sees nothing strange in all that is
going on around him. He looks upon the decade of
turmoil which has just passed, and anticipates the
coming, too, as inevitable in the history of his nation.
""These things needs be."" Such is his reply to any
remark you may please to make on the judgments
that are now shaking the very foundations of the
empire. In this he is doubtless right. Were it not
for these frequent visitations, China would have sunk
long ere this under the pressure of her accumu-
lated vices. This apparently destructive element
has been the means of preserving the political
and social life of the people from entire extinction.
A Chinaman reasons more philosophically on the sub-
ject than we seem capable of doing. We point to the
present strife, and say, ""That is hell-born."" ""No-
thing of the kind,"" remarks the Chinaman, ""it is only
an expression of the mind of Heaven."" We pro-
nounce it poison ; the Chinaman calls it medicine.
""It will convert your rich and fair country into a
barren heath,"" observes the foreigner. ""No danger,""
rejoins the Chinaman, "" it will only destroy the
weeds ; and when it is all over, we shall ring harvest
home more loudly and heartily than we have done for
the last fifty years.""
Let anyone take Hankow (called by the natives the
"" Centre of the Empire "") for his stand-point, and
calmly survey the surrounding provinces, and he will
have some idea of the extensive disorder which pre-
vails, and of the utter impotence of the central
government to cope with the evil.
Si-Chwan is to the west of us. This, the largest
and one of the finest provinces in the empire, is in a
complete state of anarchy. Shih-tah-kai, one of the
old followers of the "" Celestial King,"" is there with
400,000 men. Li-ta-ta is there at the head of a mil-
lion of men. The capital is reported to have been
taken by him. Li-ta-ta is not connected with either
the Tai-pings or Shih-tah-kai. He is setting up for
himself, and hopes in due time to drive all parties
from the field. Though the number of his men is
doubtless greatly exaggerated, still, to justify the ex-
aggeration, it must be enormous.
Kwei Chow and Yun Nan are also more or less
convulsed.
The news has just arrived at Hankow, that Shih-
tah-kai has passed over into Shen-si with a large
body of men. This is regarded by the natives as a
splendid move on his part. The province is famous for
its great merchants and wealth. The Imperialists
will find it difficult to dislodge him from his mountain
fastnesses, if he is determined to hold them. He has
also taken some places in the north-western parts of
the province of Hupeh.
Honan is to the north of us. This province has
been the prey of the Honan Filchers for many years.
In vain have the Imperialists tried to cope with them.
They aim at nothing but plunder. They take a place,
remain in it as long as it affords them the means of
subsistence, and, when thoroughly exhausted, they
bid it a temporary farewell. The mandarins have
learned this, and act accordingly. Very seldom, or
ever they come into collision. The ""Fathers of the
People"" go out at one gate, and the filchers enter at
another. When the latter retire, the former return, and
resume their places as the loving fathers of the people.
These filchers are the men that defeated the famous
Sun-kuh-ning-sin in several successive engagements
last year, and ravaged the whole of the province of
Shan-tung; they are the men that murdered Messrs.
Holmes and Parker. They are now threatening to
pay a visit to Tien-tsin, and to do with the province
of Chih-li as they have done with those of Shan-tung
and Honan. The natives say that the Tai-pings are
very angels compared with these incarnate demons.
The province of Kiang-su and Che-kiang, and parts
of Ngan-hwei, are in the hands of the Tai-pings.
They have evacuated several places of importance
within the last twelve months. To say that the Im-
perialists have recovered them, would be untrue.
Most of the cities on the banks of the Yang-tse had
become useless, or nearly so, to them. This will
probably account for their giving them up so easily.
Since the foreign powers in China have thrown their
influence on the side of the Imperialists, these cities
have become a source of weakness rather than of
strength to their cause. Thousands of braves have
been passing under their guns in foreign ships, and
they have not dared to put match to powder. All
they could do was to gnash their teeth, shake their
heads, and swear vengeance. Nanking is being closely
besieged again, and there is a rumour that the ""Celes-
tial King "" is thinking seriously of removing his
Capital. Should he do so, he will probably fix on
Hangchow. That the Imperialists, single-handed,
will be able to take Nanking, is out of the question ;
that the chief may think it prudent to leave, from fear
of a visit from the English and French, is possible
enough. It is quite credible that within six months
this noble city will cease to be the capital of the
""Great Peace"" dynasty. What then? Will the re-
bels scatter ? ""Will their power be broken. Will
Taipingdom come to naught ? This is not probable.
Their very existence and future prosperity depend
upon their adopting such a measure. In the interior
they will be at a safe distance from our shot and shell,
and will be able to carry on their aggressive measures
without fear of interference on the part of the outside
nations. The probable result of such a retirement
would be the extension of their operations into the
provinces of Kiang-si, Fuh-kien, and Canton.
""There is a vague rumour that the Yingwang (gen-
erally called the "" Four-eyed Dog "") has been cap-
tured by the Imperialists, or by Miau-pei lin, who
threatens to hand him over to the Imperialists. If
true, the Tai-pings have lost their bravest general.
Like most rumours of the kind, however, it is likely
to turn out false.
At Shanghae and Ningpo, the Tai-pings have
proved themselves to be a foe not quite so despicable
as we had supposed them to have been. In more than
one engagement they have shown considerable pluck ;
and the recapture of Ningpo has cost us more than we
had bargained for. The French have lost an excellent
Admiral, and our noble Admiral has had a very
narrow escape in these engagements. The Tai-pings
seem to hold Ward in great contempt ; and when
alone, they generally show him that, out of Imperialist
soldiers, he can make nothing but Imperialists soldiers.
These fellows are likely enough to hand him over
some fair day. Probably, he would have been in the
safekeeping of his foes long ere this, were it not for
the timely and generous aid of an arm stronger than
his, which has been stretched forth more than once
for his rescue.
Having been sadly beaten whenever they have had
the boldness to dispute the ground with the English
and French openly, the Tai-pings have very wisely
for themselves changed their tactics. They will no
longer meet us face to face; they will exchange no
more powder and shot with us if they can help it ;
but they will hover about us, cut off all supplies,
seize our boats, kidnap our men, and vanish into air
like so many spectres, the moment the attempt is
made to grasp them. Pursue them into the interior,
and they sniff the air, and laugh at your madness ;
return, and you will find them at your heels. This is
a sort of fighting which we shall find desperately hard
to deal with ; and this is on enemy that bids fair to
wear out our patience before the work is half done.
We recovered several cities and towns around Shang-
hae. Not being numerically strong enough to hold them
ourselves, and the Chinese being too craven-hearted
to, do so, they have all been abandoned, and subse-
quently re-occupied by the Taipings. Would that as
much wisdom as courage had been displayed in the
recent measures which had been adopted at Shanghae.
The latter is conspicuous enough—the former is sadly
wanting. In forsaking these captured cities, by
reason of rebel pressure, and thus confessing our in-
ability to accomplish what we had undertaken, we
have lost prestige and much moral power. The rebels
will regard each case as a signal victory ; and the Im-
perialists are beginning to whisper that foreign
generals and admirals are good for nothing, and their
own little better. Then, what an amount of misery
and wretchedness do we heap up for the people by
such measures. Mere compassion for the people who
are the victims of both rebel and imperialist cruelty and
rapacity, ought to deter us from adopting rash,
ill-advised, counsels in the present crisis.
Moreover, we have converted the Taipings into
bitter enemies to all foreigners, without gaining
the slightest personal advantage, or in the slightest
degree ameliorating the condition of others. Before
adopting such measures, the following questions ought
to have been seriously considered, ""Is it right? If
so, is it practicable ? If practicable, would it be
prudent ? Is England prepared seriously to entertain
the thought of the annexation of China ? If so, how
is the difficulty with France and Russia to be over-
come? What provinces shall we take to ourselves,
and what provinces shall be handed over to the other
parties in the field ? These are all fair questions.
But there seems to be a very strong anti-rebel mania
prevailing just now, and a determination to put it
down, come what there may. For this purpose our own
glorious admiral and ward are seen walking abreast to
the battle-field; Chinamen are taught the foreign
mode of warfare ; and our steamers are allowed to
convey Imperialist troops from Hankow to Shanghae.
We believe that the upshot will prove, that blind pas-
sion has been wielding the sceptre of late, and not
calm judgment. If Shanghae is to be defended, why
not do so from the only place where it can be done
effectually. The movements of the rebels can be con-
trolled only from Nanking ; and it is there the
Admiral ought to make his power felt—not by driving
the rebels out, which would be a suicidal course, but
by making the chief feel that his tenure of it depends
upon his faithfulness to his promises. This would cost
us but little, and the thing would be done effectually.
If we wish to see peace restored to the land, then
let us observe the strictest neutrality between the con-
tending parties. It will never be restored by
attempts to put down these movements for a
defunct government. Any interference on our part in
behalf of the Imperialists, will only protract a struggle
which must go on till a dynastic change is effected. It
is absurd to expect the Chinese to bring this about in
any fashion except their own. They will do it in
their own time and way.
And why should we render to the Imperialists the
slightest aid ? We have nothing to hope from them,
but everything to fear. They are not friendly to us,
and for aught we can see now, never will be. They
would drive us into the sea to-morrow if they had the
power. Look at their conduct towards foreigners at
Hankow or Kiukiang. Were it not for foreign
interference, Hankow would have fallen into the
hands of the rebels a year ago. The people
are now returning in large numbers, the native
hongs are springing up with amazing rapidity, and
the place promises to be as flourishing as ever within
two or three years. All this is to be traced to the
presence of foreigners. But, in spite of the good we
have done them, the mandarins seem bent
upon annoying, despising, and cheating us
to the utmost of their power. They in-
duced our representatives to fix upon the most
worthless ground in the place for a British settlement,
and have kept us waiting for it for more than a
twelvemonth. When fixed upon, the value of a lot
in that part of the town would be about three or four
hundred taels ; now they want five thousand
taels. Our boats are stopped here and
there and everywhere along the river, by
petty mandarins, because we won't pay them squeezes.
We are insulted, and not unfrequently molested by
the braves ; and the mandarins declare that they can't
manage them. When asked if they could manage
them were they themselves the victims of such indig-
nities, they reply that the two cases are different.
Not long since, a gentleman was sadly bruised by
these braves, and then taken on board their boat,
where he was made to go through the three prostra-
tions and the nine knocks. The boat was seized, in
consequence, by our authorities, and sent down the
Yangtse in a blaze. A severe argument this! but,
unfortunately, it seems to be the only kind of argu-
ment they are capable of appreciating. Ever since,
the mandarins have been more careful, and the braves
more civil.
We are told, however, that Prince Kung is our
friend. Well, it is the opinion of some, who are not
very bad judges in such matters, that Prince Kung is
playing a double game. One thing is certain, Prince
Kung is either insincere, or a mere cipher in the
Empire. The Mandarins in these parts act in direct
opposition to the letter of his treaty, and his subse-
quent instructions. The case of the Roman Catholic
priests and converts is a conclusive proof of this.
According to the treaty, persons teaching or profess-
ing the Christian religion shall alike be entitled to the
protection of the Chinese authorities ; nor shall any
such, peaceably pursuing their calling, and not offend-
ing against the laws, be persecuted or interfered with.
Prince Kung in the Peking Gazette has been reiterating
these sentiments calling upon the mandarins to treat
the Roman Catholic converts justly and lovingly, and
promising that the clause in which the Roman Catho-
lic religion is proscribed shall be omitted in all future
editions of the Sacred Edict. All this is very good ;
but in these provinces, any petty mandarin seems to
regard the whole as bosh. This must be because they
have a deeper insight into the secret counsels
of Prince Kung than our Minister seems to have, or
because he is powerless in the administration of
affairs.
Not long since, an examination was held at Nan
Chang, the provincial capital of Kiangsi. The Eng-
lish, French, and Russians were the theme. The ex-
amination was concluded by a combined assault on
the Roman Catholic establishment. The life of the
foreign priest was sought, but he managed to escape,
and afterwards to reach Kiu Kiang in safety. This
was done under the immediate notice of the great
officers of government, and, doubtless, with their
tacit consent. Placards have been posted up in
different parts of the province, denouncing our ag-
gressive policy, exposing our excessive barbarism,
and explaining our recent proceedings against the
rebels as an atonement to the government for our past
offences.
In the province of Kwei Chow, a foreign priest, has
just been executed by orders of the local mandarin.
He produced his passport ; but was told that it was a
foreign affair, with which his Excellency had nothing
to do.
In Hunan, a regular system of persecution has been
going on for some time. Chapels have been pulled
down, houses of the converts have been broken into,
and their property confiscated. The mandarins are
either unable or unwilling to do anything in the
matter.
In Peking, the Protestant religion is prohibited. A
medical missionary of large experience and high
standing is there, but he is not allowed to appear in
his compound character. He may heal the sick, but
he must not save souls. A chaplain is there, who
possesses an extensive acquaintance with the Manda-
rin dialect. Whilst requested to preach every Sun-
day to the handful of his fellow-countrymen who re-
side in the capital, he dare not mention these things to
the myriads of heathen who perish for the lack of know-
ledge. It is reported that he is allowed to teach a
dozen or more Tartar youths the English language, on
the condition that they hear nothing from him of
Christ and him crucified. One of our best missionaries,
who by his learning and piety, would do more to raise
the English character in the estimation of the magnets
of Peking than any dozen of common men, has found
it impossible to enter that city as a missionary.
During his fortnight's visit, he might talk to the
people about everything and everybody, except Christ
and his religion.
Whose fault is this? Are these Prince Kung's
doings ? We doubt it, and that for the good reason
that Roman Catholic priests are there, carrying on
their work boldly and openly, without any one dar-
ing to make them afraid. It is difficult to see why
the Chinese government should regard the Roman
Catholic priests with greater favour than the Protes-
tant missionary. There is not the slightest danger of
disturbance being excited by the preaching of the
Gospel in the city. Missionaries have visited
the surrounding towns and cities, and have
found the people remarkably well disposed;
It is not probable that they are different within the
walls of the capital. The odium of this must fall, we
fear, on one nearer to us than Prince Kung. Such a
policy is unjust and ill-advised. It must be given up
sooner or later. Why not at once ? It is high time
this matter should be minutely sifted, and its injustice
thoroughly exposed.
Such is the present aspect of affairs. It is rather
gloomy and discouraging. Let us hope that better
times are coming, and that all these commotions, and
apparently adverse circumstances, will be succeeded
by a brighter day than has ever yet dawned on this
land._
A NEW CONFEDERATE IRON-CLAD. — A corres-
pondent of the Dublin Evening Mail writes as follows:
— ""She can steam from 16 to 18 knots an hour, is
perfectly seaworthy, for all practical purposes in-
vulnerable, and will prove to any vessel she may
encounter as formidable an antagonist as our own
Warrior, the boast of the British navy. This is the
'No. 290,' as to whose whereabouts Federal cruisers
have with reason betrayed such anxiety. It had been
known for some time that a large and powerful iron
vessel was being constructed at the dockyard of
Messrs. Laird, Birkenhead ; but monsters of the deep
are so much the order of the day at that establish-
ment that no one troubled his head much about this
new production, or cared to remark the extra thick-
ness of the plates which were being used. At the
very last moment the Federal authorities seem to have
had their suspicion aroused, for the Tuscarora was
dispatched to keep watch in the neighbourhood of
the dock where she lay, and the southern
coast of Ireland was also strictly guarded
'No. 290,' meanwhile, apprised of all that was going
on, dropped down the river quietly one day, and
steamed out into the bay, nominally for her trial trip,
with a party of ladies and musicians on board. In-
stead, however, of returning to her moorings at Bir-
kenhead, where she would have been kept in durance
vile by the Tuscarora, she quietly landed her pas-
sengers at Holyhead, and proceeded on her voyage,
avoiding the harbours of Cork, Waterford, &c , in the
neighbourhood of which she might have heard of
something not all to her advantage. 'No. 290'
steamed round by Londonderry and Donegal, and was
joined off the west coast of Ireland by the steamer,
which had previously started, having on board the
armament intended for the gigantic Ironsides. Had
she even met the Tuscarora while still unarmed it
was the intention of her captain to try the fortune of
war by running stem on at full speed into her anta-
gonist. It needs no extraordinary powers of discern-
ment to discover what excitement must be caused at
the other side of the Atlantic by the arrival of the
'No. 290.'

TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD.
Sir,-""Bobstay's"" suggestion to the Marine Board
for placing a buoy at the eastern end of the reef is good
so far as it goes. It would doubtless be of use to our
yachtsmen. Ho deserves their thanks for the hint.
For years past I have thought one of two projects
should be carried out touching this reet, on which
before I wbb born the thip Edwurd Loamo was wrecked,
and all banda-28 in number-perished. The morning
after my late father picked up the doctor of the ship
and his wife locked in each other's arms on Chowder
beach. First, on reference to Captain Denham's ad-
mirable map of Port Jackson, made in 1857,1 find
that at low water there is an area ot about -150ft.
by 260ft., with a draught varying from 3ft. to 7ft.
Outside, this the soundings are from _ 18ft. to 21ft.
Now'here is a spot admirably designed on which to
ereot a fort, which, if skillfully constructed and fur-
nished with a few of Armstrong's most improved
shooting irons, and manned with crack artillerymen,
would render our port practically safe from tho invasion
of an onemy. It needs but a glance from the Sow and I
Pigs to see that the proposed fort, taking a north-east
bearing, is protected from the sight outside by the inner
South and outer North Heads. So while a cruiser
would be bearing in, before she could bring her guns
to play Bhe would be snbj'ectod to a harassing cross
fire"" from the Middle Head, the Sow and Pigs, _c,
and enfiladed before having a chance to make our litter
squeak, could bo blown away between wind and water
ero she fired a shot.
If this be not done, then I would suggest that
chambers be bored under the roof, the same as was done
at Hell Gate, Now York, and blown up, to Bubside,
and leave a depth of water at low tide from l8 to 23 ft.,
which is just outside ihe reef where the lightship rides.
There will then be no occasion to keep up the annual
expense of the floating light «lose handy. But the best
use to put tho reef to, in' my opinion, would be to
construct a fort upon it. In either case the lightship
could be dispensed with. I am, _c, '

SYDNEY.
A meeting of the Sydney Municipal Council was held
yesterday. The Mayor (Alderman J. Harris) presided,
and there were present-Aldermen Withers, Rlloy, Buckle,
Beare, Doun, Hardie, Bryen, J. D. Young, Manning, Kip-
pax, Jones. M. Harris,* Meeks, Chapman, Palmer, Leos,
Playfair, Poole, Hart, and Taylor.
TUB WAOKH ACCOUNT.
Aldermon RrLEV asked to bo supplied with a retnrn of
tho wages paid by the corporation from January to August,
1887, nnd during the corresponding period of 1888.
The MAVOH replied thal tho information asked for had
been prepared, and had been laid upon th,i table.
'1 he return showed that tho wages expenditure during
the period named in 1887 amounted to £55,212 Os. 10a., and
in 1888 to £55, 425 0s. Id.
THE WATER KATH.
Alderman HARDIE said he desired to call attention to the
wat, r rate. For houses of the value of £20 and under per
year it was proposed to charge a rate of 10s. per annum,
and Gd. per £ for all property between £20 and £300. The
rate, ho considered, was too high. 11 was only in the sub-
urbs where property would be found to be valued at £'20 or
under.
Alderman BEAKS said he had received a notice calling
upon bim to pay at tho rato of £2 2s. 6d. per room,
i Nothing could justify such a charge. They used, he pre-
sumed, about six buckets of water every tinie they cleaned
the shop. They did not uso nearly as much water as some
of the hou.es would which came under tho £20 rule in the
suburbs. Yet he was called upon to pay this high rate.
He supposed thoy required money to pay Colonel Rowe his
salan-.
alderman CHAPMAN said that with regard to the remark
mado about Colonel Bowe his opinion was that it waa most
unjust to attack a man who could not defend himself. He
belii-ved Colonel Rowe to be u gentleman well fitted tor the
position to which he had been appointed. He did not
think the salary assigned to Colonel Rowe excessively
high.
Aldorman WlTKEns said that proporfy to the amount of
about three and a-half millions had been handed over to
tho Water and Sewerage Bosrd, who had to adjust the rates
as best they could. The Board was composed of men of
ability, who were now to some extent inak-ng an experi-
ment. They had to meet the interest due upon the works
now under thoir control, and he believed that the Board
would, if they could, readjust the rates to the advantage of
the citizens. At any rate, the present wa* the wrong time to
discuss the matter.
Alderman Uu.i'.T said that in this mattor he hoped that
tho citizons would have justice. When thoy had â supplv
with which they were satisfied, they were' so liberal that
they gavo it to tho suburbs, and now they had to suffer :
they had prepared a whip for their own backs. It was
very unfair that tho citizens should be asked to pay through
the nose for water. One rato should be struck for those
living in the city, and another rate for those consumers
living outside the city boundary. The present rate was
, most iuciuitublo, because those who used a luge amount
of water would have a reduced rate.
Alderman YOUNO said that what Alderman Riley should
have dono was to havo risen in his placo in the Houaa and
spoken upon this matter, but inctead of doing that he did
not open his mouth when indignity was being heaped on
tho council. A)dermien Riley, Alderman Beare, and others
now blamt-d the Water and ¡sewerage Board ; but what had
tboy to do with the cause of complaint? He, as a member
of that board, did his duty fe-arlossly. Three and a-half
millions had been expended on tho scheme, and thoy hal to
raise a revenue or the board would soon bo turned out of
office. What would they have to pay for insurance if they
had not these watennains passing their doors ? That waa a
thing they should consider. They were now called upon to ,
Day less than tho rate charged in Melbourne and Adelaide.
It struck him that the citizens of Sidney would yet bave to
pay more than tho »ate at present cbargi-d. As to Colonel
Rowe, be had a dut* to perform, and if he neglected his
duty ho would have to qwt office.
Alderman PALMER said that the members of the Water
and ¡sewerage Board speut weeks in adjusting tho rate,
and they fixed it as low as they possibly could. In Mel- J
bourne the rato was eightpence in tho pound, hero it was
6d. The board had to flud £120,000 to meet their liability,
and ho was alraid that at the close of the year the board
would bo £15,000 in arrear. As to Alderman Riley's pro-
posal to charge ono rato in the city and another in the
«uburbs, he was afraid that the suburbs would not agree to
that. The council and tho citizens should give the board a
fair trial before they condemned them.
'Ihe matter then dropped.
TUB PHOPUSBD OEORGE-STMSBT TRAMWAT.
Alderman MPKKS said that some notice ought tobo taken
of tho proposal of tho Government to run a tramway along
Georgo-strcet. The council was fully entitled to be con-
sidered in this matter, whether the proposal came from the
Government or a private company. It was the duty of the
council to prevent the Government carrying out such a pro-
posal unless the council received a percentage of the revenue
derived from tho tramway. He could find nothing in the
Tramway Act which authorised the Government to take
such a ronrso.
Alderman MANNING said that if they intonded to take
action they should do so before anything of a definite
nature was done by the Government. They should put in
a claim for the protection of th; rights of citizens similar to
tho system pursued by the council in Melbourno.
Alderman CHAPMAN askea that the Major in the inter-
view which he waa to have with the Premier would refer
to the mattoi-of tho proposed tramway.
The MAYUH promised that ho would do so.
BLASTING OPERATIONS.
Alderman MANNING said ho desired to draw atten-
tion to what had been dono by the Mayor in
connection with the blasting operations which
hod been going on in the sewerage operations.
He believed that in consequence of the action of the <layor
the Government hud taken the matter up, and had asked
the contractor for au estimate for continuing tho boring
operations, using less powder. The estimate was not, he
thought, satisfactory, but he believed that the operations
would now be conducted in a way that would not be likely
to injure tho citizens' property.
THE FINANCIAL POSITION OP THE COUNCIL.
Tho MAYOR read the following report:-"" I have the
honour to again draw your attention to the financial
position of the City Council. This year an extra
upon the previous annual expenditure has been
increased by the payment of £42,500 as interest on loans
and tho sinking fund. Next year the sum will be £47,500,
which wo aro by Act of Parliament compelled to pay.
Other losses and expenses will present themselves, and I
estimato that tho rovenuo for the year 1889 will be about
£72,500 less than 1837, and £30',000 loss than 1888. At
present wo havo an overdraft of £43,000. This statement
demands your immediate uttcntion Consideration may bo
cal ed to my previous reports, in which I have suggested
possiblo retrenchment without affecting the working of
tho departments, viz., the Town Clerk's and the
City Treasurei's. To offect a saving I havo exercised my
power to its fullest extent, and ti list iu representing these
facts that you will assist and support In considering tho ad-
visability ot making further reductions in the labour and the
clerical branches of our staff. The former, in my opinion,
could bo reduced by at least £'250 per week, or with the
other branches to be dealt with as you may determine.""
Alderman RICKY said that a statement had been made
in the sydney Morning Herald to the effect thut the
Council were losing money annually by not assessing pro
portj' upon which buildings wero being erected. Ho would
like to know whether tho statement was truo.
Tho MAYOR said that as a matter of law he believed
thoy could charge, but as a matter of oqaity it was not
judicious to do BO.
Tho Mayor's ieport was received without further discus-
sion.
PROPOSED SEATS NEAR MOORE FARR.
Alderman WITHERS moved,-"" That in view of the fact
that lhere is no accommodation for porsons waiting for
the trams at tho junction of Botany-street and Park
road, a sufficient number of seats bo placed in the tri
augular piece of land opposite Selwyn-street for public
convenience, and sufficient means ot access to same bo
provided, the necessary expenditure to be left to the dis-
cretion of the Mayor.""
Alderman CHAPMAN objected to the motion on the
ground that no estimate of the proposed work was given,
as required under the bylaws.
The MAYOU said that the objection was fatal to the
motion, which he ruled out of order.
PUOPOSEI) IMPUOVKMENT OP CAMPBELL-STREET.
Alderman KIPP ix moved,-"" That the Mayor's report
with reference to the resumption of properties in Campbell
street required for widening same, numbered 6, 7, 8, 9, and
10, as shown ou plan submitted, bo adopted, and the follow-
ing amounts paid to the persons hcreunder specified, upon
transfer to the council :-No. ß, Mr. Collins, £100i>; No.
7, New South Wales Mortgage Loan Company, as shown
on plan, and additional land extending along Kxeter-laaoas
far as Exeter-place, widening the whole of Exeter-lane,
£1500 ; No. 8, William Dawson. £1560 ; No. 9, A. Brown,
£'2000; No. IU, St. Joseph's Building Society. That the
Government be requested to resume this portion, the
trustees of same being unable to give a title.""
Alderman CHAPMAN moved the following amendment,
""Atter the word society, the motion rood-'On condition
that the Government resume, &c.'""
Alderman MANNING said that as the Premier was to be
appealed to foraconliuunnce of the endowment to the council,
this work wou d be au excellent argument. It showed tue
efforts of the council to improve tho city, and the improve-
ment would enublo the Government to lay down a tram from
Campbell-street to the lower part of the city. Unless the
Govemment took a liberal view of the affairs of the council,
he would be disposed to adjourn this matter until the
fiuancos of the council wera in a better condition than at ¡
present. The council were not responsible tor much of, the
I expenditure that had been necessary, ¡sydney was handed
over to the council with all its itnperteetious of survey, and
they had to remedy tho defi-cts.
Alderman .> ouso said that it would be unfair to give
preference to this work when there was a street at Miller's
Point leading to three of the principal wharfs, along
which street only one dray could pa:-« at a time.
The uiueudiucnt proposed by Alderman Chapman was
agreed to.
CITV HEALTH OPPICER.
Alderman KIPPAX moved, -"" That the temporary ar
pointmi-nt of Dr. William Rudolph Clay, as City Health
Officer, as reported to the council by his worship tho
Mayor on the 10th of September last, be confirmed by this
council, and that he be and ia hereby appointed City Hea th
Officer of th« city of Sydney, with a monthly salary, at the ,
rato of £250 per annum.""
Alderman CHAPMAN said that the apppointment ought to I
bo thrown open to competition.

(Before his Honor Mr. Justice STEPHEN.)
The Hon.; J. E. Salomons, Q.C., assisted by Mr. Murray,
appeared on behalf of the Crown.
THE ALLEGED RAILWAY FRAUDS.
The case of alleged conspiracy against Lionel William ,
Lee, Duncan M'Alister, and Ernest Jefferies Buckland
was continued. The defendants are charged with having ,
at Bourke, amongst themselves and with diverse other
persons unknown, conspired to defraud the Commissioner
for Railways of diverse large sums of money.
Mr. G. B. Simpson, Q.C., instructed by Mr. Shorter and
Mr. Roberts, appeared for the defence.
Charles Lambert, who was under cross-examination
when the Court adjourned on Friday, was recalled, and
further cross-examined.
Joseph Heylin, formerly,an employee in the Rnilway
Depnrtment, gave evidence with reference to a system of
averaging which, he deposed, was in force when he joined
the department and when he left, and which was known to
officials, and carried out by clerks.
Frank Farnell deposed that he had been in the em-
ployment of the Railway Department; he acted as goods
clerk at Blayney in May, 1880 ; he afterwards went
to Wellington as goods clerk and relieving officer; he was
afterwards appointed travelling paymaster on the railway,
and subsequently resigned in order to enter Parliament;
during the time he was in the service he saw a system of
averaging carried on amongst carriers ; it was
customary with consignments of a certain
weight to estimate so many bales at 4cwt. each
bale, and to see how many could be allowed to pass as
under 2501bs. so, as to bring the consignment up to the total
weight.
Richard Beattie deposed that he was formerly station
master in the employment of the Railway Department for a
period of eipht years ; witness resigned in September,
1880 ; he was aware that a system of averaging, whereby
the weight of wool was ascertained, was carried on.
John Clifton Anderson, forwarding agent at Bourke,
deposed that he know the witness Duneen; he saw Duneen
shortly after certain paragraphs had appeared in the news
papers with regard to the alleged frauds ; one morning
Duneen said to him, when talking about the fraud, that
there was nothing in it; that it would all end in smoke ;
and that he was sure that Lee and M'Alister were not in it,
and that he could clear them if anything was brought
against them; a system of averaging was carried on, which
was well known to every clerk in the service.
Detective Campbin was called, and produced a letter
written by M'Cullum to the Inspector-General of Police,
alleging that frauds were being committed in connection
with the Government Railways.
Charles Robinson, commercial traveller, deposed that he
knew the witness Duneen, and that Duneen, in reply to a
question as to how the carrying agents would got on, said
he was sure they would be committed for trial, but no jury
would convict, as the practice of averaging bales had been
going on for years to his knowledge.
Edwin Janies, a drover, deposed that the evening before
the day on which Duneen left Bourke for Sydney Duneen
told him that he was going to clear Lee and M'Alister, that
the system of averaging was known to him and to the de-
partment for a number of years.
P. C. Close, in the employment of Hill, Clark, and Co.,
and C. C. Fraser, commission agent, gave evidence to the
effect that the marks on bales of wool would not rub out
easily.
This closed the evidence for the defence.
David Kirkcaldie, assistant traffic manager, recalled by
Mr. Salomons, deposed that he had been in the employment
of the railway department sjnoe 1876, and never knew of
any system of averaging being carried on.
C. A. Goodchap, Commissioner for railways, re-called,
gave similar evidence ; similar evidence was also given by
Charles Paul, Stationmaster, Darling Harbour ; Alexander
Sweet, and John Ward.
William Henry Duneen was recalled, and denied that
he had made statements such as those referred to by wit-
nesses for the defence.
To Mr. Simpson : It was true that a charge of embezzle-
ment was made against witness by Lambert; the charge
was one of embezzlng monies of the department ; it was
utterly false, and scandalas as false.
David Kirkcaldie was recalled, and stated that he had
investigated the charge of embezzlement made by Lambert
against Duneen.
Mr. Salomons: Is there any foundation whatever for
such a charge.
Mr. Simpson objected to such, a question being put.
His HONOH upheld the objection, and pointed out that

?General, in the course of his letter,
.says :-"" I regret that you have not

tion, or save time. If a receiving ofiieo were
established, it is out of the question that
tbo Government should accept any rosponsi.
bility until the documents are received by
thaRegistrar of Deeds; and I must point
out that serious questions of priority of re
gistration would be euro to arise, to settle
which the aid of the Supremo Court
would bo required, ued loss and
hardship would doubtless follow. The
additional duties could be performed hy one
of tho Government officots now stationed at
Launceston, but I foul sure the Chamber of
Commerce would not loug be satisfied with
merely a rcoeiving offico, but would demund
further concessions and 'privileges, which
would in turn increase the exponses of tho
colony. I would also point out that what-
ever concession ia grunted to Laun-
ceston in this rcspeot would also bo
immediately claimed by tho North-West
Coast and tho West (""oast, and to give them
a like concession each would moan additional
expense. It has already been pointed out
that at tho present timo no objeclion exists
to the receipt hy post at tbo Hobart Office
of deeds for registration, aud this practice
has been availed of by practitioners In Laun-

This Company is formed to purchase and work the estate of
!5G0 aeres freehold In the Pari-h of Teralba, adjoining tho West
Wallsend Coal Company. Tills is one of tbc few remaining great
freehold estates with tho Nowcastlo coal seams underlying the
whole area. . , "" . . , . . ,
The fnmous Wallsend seam Is believed to exist nclow tne
whole surface, as proved by the West Wallsend shnfts and the
bores of the Mnnk-Wearmoiith and other collieries adjacent, as
well as bv the boro on the property itself, as shown by the sec-
tion herewith, as supplied from the Mines Department,
Sydney. , ...
A consumption of 30 acres per annum, based on a yearly output
of 240.000 tons fthc Neweastlo Wallsend Company uses 50 acres
per annum), will- give tho Company a life of 85 years from the
Wallsend seam alone.
This mino possesses an important advantage over many of the
mines now working in this district very piofltnbly. vi/., that it is
freehold, and without any charge for royalty on the coal pro-
duced.
ESTIMATED PROFITS.
An output of 150,000 tons per annum, at 11s per ton,
will give gross Income .£82,100
Less cost free on board shipping, at 7s Oil. 58,125
Gross profit .£24,375
Directors, Office, and other charges . 2,000
Not profit.£22.375
Interest on debentures, £25,000, at 6 per cent. 1,500
£20,875
Dividend nt 15 per cent, on £110.000 . 16,500
Annual margin for depreciation . 4,375
£20,875
It Is further to be borne In mind that the profit from sale of
(mall coal will bo a considerable itom. In addition to the above.
As the coal trado Is rapidly growing, the annual output In a
few years may be expected to rise to 200,000 tons, and then to
250,000 tons, in which case the dividends would be propor-
tionately increased.
Tho following tables give the trade of Newcastle since 1881, and
the output of tho lending collieries last year (1887) :

The above table» will show how It is that tho new mines as
'lucy are opened find profitable employment without Injury to tbo
older collieries The trado io a growing one, and tbcro Is plenty
of room for the new mines year by year.
The value of this freehold estate lor snrfaco only is very great,
as it Is a beautiful open champaign country, sultablo in great part
for farms, orchards, &c. The recent falos of the West Wallsend
Coal Co. allotments have been at the rate of £120 per acre, and a
large profit is anticipated outside sales of coal, from lease and
sale of surface rights.
The vendora ask for this unique property the sum of about £31
per acre only, parable as under : -
In paid-up'shares.£35,000
In cash payable within l8 months from date of
registration, say In 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and l8
months, by equal instalments .20,000
In debentures, having currency of five years,
bearing 6 per cent, interest, and secured on tho
property .25,000
""* "" ' £80,000
Tho Subscribed Capital, amounting to 75,000 Shares at £1, say
«75,000. would bo appropriated thus;
To the Vendors, as above .£20,000
, For cost of opening the Mine, Machinery, and
Running Plant . 55,000
£75,000
The West Wallsend Coal Co. has just started on an expenditure
of about £45,000; so the sum provldod above (£55,000) la ample
for nil purposes.
The Railway of the Company will be about a mile In length to
the West Wallsend Railway, which can bo used on payment of
traction rate, or on payment of part cost and maintenance.
There Is an ample supply of timber on tho estate, not only for
the wants of the colliery, but for Bale for building purposes.
This feature In the property is of great Importance, as many of
the collieries are now at great expense for props.

Notwithstanding tho very many counter attractions
yesterday, between seven and eight hundred people visited
Gorrey's Gardens, Cabarita Point, on the Parramatta
River. The journey to the gardens is one of the most beauti-
ful to be had around the metropolis. Tho river yoster
doy waa simply a sheet of glassy water, and it
was so smooth that the gentle breore which blew
could scarcelv raise a ripple. Dame Nature had donned her
best garb, and tho tourist could not but be struck with tho
very gorgeous scenery that presented itself to tho eye, foi
after the late rains all vegetation seemed to have taken now
life. The run to Cabarita was almost too short, but upon
landing at the gardens the visitor soon found that he could
find plenty of amusement to occupy his attention. In the
spacious pavilion dancing to some excellent music rendered
by tho ïoung Australian Band, under the conduotorahip of
Mr Hardio, was much enjoyed, while those who did not to
care could take a stroll around the grounds, and get peeps
of the lovely scenery on the river which is to bo had from
Cabarita. Swings and such-like outdoor amusement« wer«
also indulged in. The assembly wa« most orderly, «nd
everyon» wa« pleased with a most enjoyable day'«
Fern Bay, a publie resort further up the river, wa« also

From a correspondent wo loam that at the date of the I
Lubcck'8 departure from Tonga everything was quiet and
the prospects of trado wore very good."" Our correspondent
says :
j "".It'seems very likely indepd that a large amount of
copra will be produced this season, as there ""ms been no
hurricane, and the crop of nuts is consequently a larpe one.
In religious matters also there is peace, at all events for the
posent, as both parties aro awailinir tho result of the recent
inquiry conducted by the High Commissioner. There is no
active persecution against the Wesloyans, and tho people
aro ostensibly freo to join any church thoy please. The new
church, which is being erected by the Free Church people in
front of the Rev. Mr. Muult _'s house, is now well odvancod,
and as poon as the timber which is1 expected to arrive by the
Richmond 1» roceived, rapid progress will bo made The
King himself is superintending the erection. Ho is present
every day with tho workmen, and has beon several times
up in the roof assisting them in fixing and tying tho
timbers. This might bo regarded as rather a hazardous
porlormanco for a man of his advanced years, but ho
appears to be still quite halo and stroug, and devoid of all
fear. The Rev. G. Brown and Mr. P. P. Fletcher, the
commissioners appointed by the Wesloyan Church in
Sydnoy to inquire into the state of affairs in Tonga, have
been engaged in thoir work during the past'month, and are
now returning by the Lubeck.^ From all that we cari learn,
they have done their best to' ascoitain the ttue state of
affairs, irrespective of parties. ' What their report will
bo is, of course, not known here, but it is gonerallv
believed that thoy aro m favour of concessions boing
made on both sides, by which the Wesleyun Church
may be again united, and that thoy uro not without hopes
that some plim may bo formulated by which this may be
secured. One good result of the visit of these gentlemen
will certainly be that they will have a better idea of the
actual state of affairs here .'than thoy had before their
uri i val, as they have had the opportunity of testing the
trustworthiness or otherwise of many of* tho loiters and
stories which havo appeared from timo to time in the
colonial newspapers about affairs in Tonga. Thoy have
had frequent interviews with both parties, including tho
Kinir, and have also conversed freely with both chites and
natives. It is hoped that some plan may bo found by
which this quarrel may bo put an end to, as people down
here are hcarlily tired of it all.,
1 "" Mr. Shirley Baker, tho son of the Premier, who was so
severely wounded in the attempt to assassinate his father,
is again attending to his duties, but grave fears are outer- '
tnincd that he will never regain tho uso of tho arm which
was so seriously injured Miss Beatrice Baker, who so
nobly covered hor father with her own body, and so received
the bullets or slugs which wero intended for him, is still
seriously ill ; and though eight months have now elapsed
since tho attack, she is still confined tojier bed.' and owing
to the injury received in her spine is compelled to
remain in ono unvarying position, as she cannot bo moved .
without gi oat danger, and all excitement has'to be care-
fully ganrded against. It is for this reason that sho has
not yet been allowed to seo her brother, who WUB woundod
at the same timo.
*' The new schoonor Toafa ILtameà, built in Auckland for
the King, bus arrived, and loft hero a fow days afterwards
for Nina Foou, with Itov. J. B. Watkin, Mr. Charnier, and
some natives as passengers. TheMuile, from Auckland,'has
siso arrived, having on board Messrs. M'Millán,'M.Ii,A.,
of Sydnoy.nnd Thompson, of the fiim-'of Messrs. M'Arthur
nnd Co. It is generally surmised that those gentlemon in-
tend to make ""somo alterations in the management of the -
affairs of tnat firm in theso islands, but the nature of them
is not yet known.
We have now a mco comfortable hotel in Nukualofa,
called the International Hotol, which is conducted by Mr.
and Mrs, Bentley, into ot.Fiji. This affords a quiet and
pleasant homo to all who, from business or pleasure, may
havo to visit Tonga. , We down here think that if tho ad-
vantages of, a visit to,Tonga during the winter montha in
Sydney wereiinore fully known, we should have a large
influx of visitors, and ""wo aro sanguino enough to believo
that thoy would be pleased and bonofited by their stay, and
would bo auro to rovibit ' our fair island, and also^induce
others to, do the sumo. The voyago can bo mado between
Touga and-Sydney by the Lubeck in about BBven days,
whilst passengers who wuk at tho same time to visit,
or to return via Fiji, can do so by tho boats of the
Union Steamship Company, which connect at Tonga with
tho Lubeck, or thoy can moko the trip from Tonga to New
Zealand, via Samoa and Tahiti, by the s s. ltiuhmond.
We in Tonga often wonder whether the peoplo in Sydney
aro fully awaro of tho immense imptovomont in means of
transit which has been effectod by the appointment of a
first-class bteatnor like the Lubeck to run between Sydnoy,
Samoa, and Tonga. A.few years ago nona of us old'resi-
dents would have ventured to predict such an event as
likely to happen within tho next 50 years, and yet to-day
it is an accomplished fact, and hundreds of poor miserable
sufferers from bronchitis and ' the thousand ills that flesh
is hoir to ' during a New South Wales or Victorian winter
may in a few days exchango the cold winds and variablo
weather of Australia tor balmy breezes and sunny skies in
Tonga. Lot me advise your readers to go down to the
Circular Quay and look at the good ship Lubeok, with her
splendid accommodation for passengers, and if possiblo get
an interview with her genial commander, Captain
Schmöldor, and thou many of them will Tie sure to pay us
a. visit. ) -^_'",The Sydney Morning Herald ,"770,842,854,852,77,844,855,847,848,854,852,852,851,851,847,853,851,850,850,850,851,851,849,849,849,847,847,846,849,851,849,849,848,847,847,848,847,848,849,845,846,848,847,847,848,846,448,853,846,861,847,850,849,847,845,843,849,861,846,844,852,239,814,846,848,849,848,849,846,863,848,245,814,846,848,849,846,846,848,850,849,850,849,842,846,849,841,850,845,849,850,850,846,845,848,850,849,850,852,851,851,850,851,851,850,850,607",Mon 5 Sep 1887,"360,448,480,511,551,582,613,645,676,707,740,769,802,833,865,896,928,958,991,1022,1052,1087,1117,1147,1179,1209,1241,1274,1304,1336,1367,1397,1425,1461,1493,1525,1555,1586,1616,1649,1680,1711,1742,1773,1805,1836,1867,1898,1931,1962,1993,2026,2056,2086,2119,2150,2182,2213,2244,2275,2307,2339,2369,2401,2433,2464,2495,2527,2559,2588,2621,2653,2684,2715,2747,2778,2810,2842,2872,2901,2935,2964,2998,3030,3061,3094,3123,3155,3186,3217,3249,3280,3312,3343,3374,3405,3433,3468,3499,3532,3561,3593,3624,3651,3686,3718,3746","2870,2797,2768,2769,2769,2779,2769,2769,2771,2771,2771,2771,2772,2771,2773,2771,2773,2774,2773,2774,2773,2774,2775,2775,2776,2778,2777,2776,2777,2775,2776,2778,2777,2777,2778,2778,2778,2778,2778,2778,2779,2779,2779,2779,2779,2780,2778,2774,2780,2779,2780,2779,2779,2781,2780,2780,2779,2779,2779,2780,2777,2778,2813,2780,2779,2778,2779,2779,2778,2778,2779,2778,2810,2779,2777,2778,2777,2778,2778,2776,2777,2776,2777,2778,2776,2776,2778,2775,2776,2776,2775,2774,2774,2775,2773,2773,2772,2773,2772,2772,2773,2773,2773,2772,2772,2774,2772",13647999,Page 4

gavo a rcsumt of tho past year Ho Haul it had
been for all of thom a rather trying yeai lot, from
tho way in which tho school had hoon sup
nortoj, nothing wrcicua bid happened« Turu
ing from the darker to what ho termed
the brighter side, there had beon a good deal of evi-
dence that the old, if he might so term thom, mstitu
tiona of the school had been successfully car-
ried on, and ono or two now ones in-
augurated Ihey would And at the bottom
of the prize list, ""RcwardB for good work
and conduct "" Ihey thought it would be a good
featuie to let parents know that their boys were
working well, and he was certain that the institution
had done good In this way tho masters got a good
deal of support from the home, and he especially
asked motho-s not to forgot what a groat influence
thoy could exert, not only on the boys' In es morally,
bnt intollectuallv as well Ho would like to be able
to put into every parent's hands the Hon A Little
ton's book entitled "" Mothers and bo»s "" After
speaking of the success of the school us indicated in
the ropoits of the eiammations, ho referred to tho
dosirability of supplementing tho school work by
courses of carpentry and physical sciences, for in a
country lil o this they wanted men who could uBe
their 'hands rs well ns their heads
JIa did not say that *hev should throw
ovor intellectual studies thoy should rather go
into thom with groator keenness but what ho did
sty was that, whilst teaching the languages and his-
tory of the past they should ondcavoui to do as littlo
useless work as possible Ho was convinced that

if the University would bo content w ith less compost

saying that tho classics w ero ofteto and no good He
thought it was the duty of the school to undertake

it was possible to do He concluded hy paying a

in asking lum to proscnt the prizes, he wished
that the person invited had hid more knowledgo of

straight to sea, and he had a very lively recollection
of his fathor taking him down to Portsmouth aid
leaving him ou boord the Vwtory, JSTel»on's own
ship, and soon after he was sent off to the Ei3t
Indies However, on the Britannia, latot on, ho
picked up something of scheol ways and Behool
customs, and the proceedings of that day re-
minded bun voiy much of what used to
tako place at Dartmouth at the distribution of
prizis to tho cadets Ho was very pleased to .lotice
tho great progress that school hud mado since its
opening only a fon years ago, and ho was glad te see
that manly oiercieos woro well kept up, for he
believed they were highly necessary for de
veloping the muscles a»d occupying spare
timo, eo long as thev did not take the place of more
useful things Ho had mentioned the word ""homo,""
and he might say that nothing had surprised lum
moro than te hear people who were born out here
speaking abtut England as home It was vory
pleasing to him to hear the old country spokeu of ¡u
that n ay (Cheers ) Ho hoped that tho feeling
would exist, not only in Australia, but
m overy other English community After
all, this was the country of their adoption,
and therefore it should be their happiness
and pleasure to do all they could to dovelop its re
sources (Applause ) Ho concluded by expressing
the wish that thoy would have a \ory pleasant

gratulated the school upon the success that had boon

I TO THE EDITOR OS THE HERALD
SIB,-Whatever defect» or absurdities msy be charged)
against the Real Property Act of this colonv, or its admin-
istration, with more or less show of truth, those lately
brought forward by Mr. Cox, in tho Legislative Council, on
the authority of the letter addressed to bira by Mr. S. Ay ""
Stepben, cannot be reckoned in the list.
As a matter of fact, the established practice of. the Lana
Titles Office in the case put by Mr. Stephen-the death of '
one of four co-grantees and a transmission application' in
respect of his »hare by his representatives-is to issues '
certificate or certificates (according to the relative position/
of the granted lands), to tho applicant alone, unies» tia
other co-owners desire certificate» also. In other words,
the . evidence of title ot tho surviving . grantees
remains precisely what it was before the death
of, tho other co-grantee. Mr. Stephen's »tatemen!
that the office would in the case supposed insist upon issuing .
a now certificate to the survivingreiristered proprietor» is th«
result of a singular misconception of the procedure observed,'
and can, I suppose, be only accounted for by the construction ' .,'
he would place upon the 86th section of the Real Propertj
Act, which is undoubtedly a very extraordinary enactment., '
As to the suggested endorsement, "" B having died on
such a date, the interest which he held in the within land
has been transmitted to Z and Y his trustees,"" my, im-
pression is that tho Bogistrar- General might not give it the
approvalulucli Mr. Stephen anticipates; for, in the firs!
plac*, the Heal Pi operty Act disowns all trusts and indica-
tions thereof, so far as certificates or grants are concerned *
and, Jn tho next place, it is difficult to understand why.
because D "" died on such a date,"" therefore his interest
would bo transmitted to trustees. Such a transmiasioi
might certainly be the result of a deviso in a will, but hardlj
of n diath simplicité):
i Then, as to the amalgamation or consolidation of grants!. .
' The]practico is to consolidate all çrants,both on transmission ""'
or transfer, whensoever practicable. And in carrying oui
this- practice tho draftsman is certainly not terrified ,
by tho more number of grants. For example,
not very long ago a member of the Legislative Council re-
ceived one certificate of title into which 93 grant» had been
reduced. Moro.reiently, 3B0 grants were coniolidated into
' 22 certificate» ; and a case has just beeu dealt with in which,
,373 grants will bo represented by about 20 certificate». Tha ""'
' practice of consolidation, indeed, is one which is illustrated
m the oflice almost daily, and ranges far beyond the limit»
which Mr. Stephen appears to fix.
Had the Land Titloä Department been in the habit of disi r ' ,
tributing certificates oil titlo or transmission» or transfers, ' '
after tho fashion which that gentleman has described, it
would long »go hine been not only a self-supporting 1

A» Ocrroftis CAFTDRED AT PORTLAND, VICTORIA.*
The Guardian of Tuesday states that at Mr. Thomas
Kean's shop, in Gawler-street, there is on view a verj
fine, specimen of that singular animal the octopus, ' i '
commonly known as the devil-fish.' Yesterday morn-
ing Mi. itean found a couple of these monsters on the:
beach, and after some trouble captured the largest.
This marine monster appears quite contented in his ,
new home-a zinc washing tub-although we should
fancy he must weary for a good stretch occasionally.
His' tentacles appear to be about two feet in length,
and he is quick to resent any encroaohment on his <
new domain by spouting water at tile intruder oï - >
throwing out one of his slimy feelers. Altogether he
is certainly one of the mo3t curious animals we have
» ever seen, although ho cannot lay much claim to '
L beauty.
BtBLio os A STRANDE AKIHAX,.-Mr. D. Lowe, who
resides near Warialda, informs the Inurell Tttnet that,
buried ten feet below the top surface of a creek, al , ^
1 -Balmain, he discovered recently tho remains of a
gigantiq animal. The thigh bone (which he has taken,
possession of) is about three times as large as that of ?
bullock. It is a pity wo have no scientific gentle- -
man in this district'to examine Mr. Lowe's flndv '
{If the bone is so remarkable for size as is here '
"" mdipated, the better mode of satisfying the curiosity
the discovery must arouse is to send it to the Curator ,
of tile Museum, Sydney. A knowledge of com- "".
¿taratire anatomy may determine the character of ,

EXAMINATION MEETING.
Re William Thomas Ryan Sinclair, adjourned ex-
amination meeting Mr Lange appeared on behalf
of the official assignee Germain Verge, residing near
Gladstone, on (the Macleay River, deposed that about the
year 187o he lent the insolvent some money, he did not
know the exact amount, but thought it was about £100,
the object of the loan was to enable Sinclair to pay a
portion of tho purchase-money on land purchased from
William Dawes, who held a mortgage over it, the insol-
vent gave him a promissory note for that loan.
On September 8th, 188o, a bill of sale made

ness purchased the billiard-table from the sheriff's
officer, privately about four months ago, the sale
of the billiard-table by the sheriff's officer
took place in a parlour of the insolvent's inn the only
persons present were the insolvent, the bailiff, and witness,
witness never took possession of the billiard-table, but left
it on the premisos , the amount witness paid tho bailiff for
the billiard-table was, he thought, £74 or £7o , witness  
was not aware that any notice of the sale was ever given in    
the town, the sale was made at about 5 o'clock in the
afternoon, the billiard-table was worth about £90 on the
Macleay River, witness obtained a receipt for the amount
he paid the sheriff's officer, but he gave that receipt to the

the property named in the bill of sale Francis Burke, who
was a billiard-maker employed at the insolvent's hotel,

A collision occurred this evening between the steamers
Derwent and Wentworth. Tho Derwent was lying at
Howard Smith's wharf, and tho Wentworth was
coming in'from the north. In rounding a sharp bend
at Kangaroo Point, the Wentworth apparently
became unmanageable, was swept by. tho tide against
the Derwent, striking her forward of amidships and
grazing along her side. An indentation was made in
the Derwent's plates. Two boats wore smashed and
tho davits were carried away,' probably by the Went-
worths anchor, which was hanging over tho starboard
bow. . .",The Sydney Morning Herald ,"853,694,277,542,347,817,856,852,855,855,853,853,853,854,853,853,434",Mon 26 Apr 1886,"2772,2818,2906,2942,3003,3038,3074,3112,3148,3187,3224,3260,3298,3336,3372,3411,3454","1959,2040,2246,2112,2432,1994,1957,1959,1957,1957,1957,1958,1959,1957,1959,1959,1958",13641999,Page 7

FLORENCE DIXIE.
. The attack on Lady Florcnco Dixie-or, as some of the
newspapers now put it, tho "" reported "" attack-is shrouded
In mystery. The firbt rumours -which reuched London on
IMarch 17 declaiou that Lady Florence had been stabbed to
death. Later accounts on tbe following (Sunday) morning
'averred that hor dress alono hud suffered Irotn thu knives of
'the miscreants ; and this it appears is the sum and substance
of tho injury done. Her ladyship, we are assured, has ex-
pressed lier regret that so much bus been made of the case ;
'but it wus tho sensational nurrativo supplied by herself, in
ilho first pluoe, that caused so much interest and excito
.inent, and led to a desire for further news respecting tho
? alleged outrage. Tho "" further news "" has suggested
the hypothesis that Lady Florence was only
beset by common, sturdy beggura and tramps,
,nnd that contusion, excitement, tbo eüecls of being slightly
. istunned, and the recent murders nnd explosions, combined
to afi'ect her imagination, and to colour (of course uncon
'eciously) her narrativa of events. The further the police
?pursue their investigations the moro thoy appcar.pujr¿led by
tho whole circumstances of tho case. They cannot account
for two such very tall men, dichsed, as one appears to have
been, in a striking costume of green, coming into such a
quiet country district without attiaetiug the attention
,of roany of tho country people. Nor can they ex-
plain tbo disappearance of the scoundrels from |
? the sceno eilhor byroad or river without being noticed j
'by many who could speak to the fact. Tho ground
""where the outrage nccuried has been carefully inspected, but
without iiiTorcling uny evidence of a struggle having taken
'place. Had a dog ot tho massive build of tho St. Bernard,
.Hubert, attacked a man, it is only concoivable that the sott
ïnould would ho toiu up, but thoro aro no evidence* of a
struggle cither at the bpot whero Lady Florence Dixie was
-thrown down, or anvwhoro near it. Again, the dog has been <
carefully looked to. but ho does not appear to ka ve a Bciatch, or
an injury of any kind. Lady Florence Dixie is reported to
have fully recovered fiom the shook occasioned hythe attack
'on her. No doctor has been called in to see hor ladyship, and
Sndecd his services would scarcely be required, na beyond tho
'slight wound in the hand thoro aro no traces of any injuries
either on the throat, where Lady Florence Dixio says one of
the miscreants caught hold of her, or on the head, where
ter ladybhip believes she received a blom It is indeed both,
fortunate and remarkable that Lady Florónos Dixio should
have clutched suoh a iormiduble weapon us a dagger with-
out inflicting any greater injury upon herself. The Home
.Secretary, in replying to a question, fcnid the alleged attack
upon Lady Florence Dixie was undergoing* careful inquiry

persuado a business man into anything good by tho in-
telligent uso of wise and moderato argument, but this has
no weight with a woman. Thoy uko what they Uko, be-

On tho other hand, it must not be imagined that all tho
perspicacity in tho world u the exclusivo property of the
male sex
A large trado in Sydney is done in floor sweepings, and
tea ia tho nomo gn en to such, and it is sold too in largo
quantities
It Is earned on to snch an extent that several of tho largo
merchants think it dcsirablo that tea should bo sold in

Wo think BO too. We bclicvo that by putting upa really
first-class tea and selling it at a moderato prieo wo aro

LONDON, NOVKMBBB 6, 1868.
[WHITTEN EVPRESBI/V ion THE S. M. HEKALII.]
THE great political battle for Parliamentary power
has now fairly commenced, and before a fortnight
has elapsed the country will have emphatically deci-
ded whether the Conservatives or the Liberals are
to be masters of the situation. Everywhere the
canvassing is going on in grim earnest, sometimes,
ae at Blackburn, mingled with fierce rioting and
even bloodshed. The publicans, too, ate playing
their little game. Where they are not being bribed
by the different competing candidates, they are to be
found starting their own man, their logic evidently
being that if the electors choose to make them an in-
fluential class, it is but fair that the influence so ob-
tained should be exerted to the uttermost on behalf
of those possessing it. The new voters do not, as a
rule, see things exactly in this light, hence we have
the curious end significant anomaly of the great mass
of electors being found ranged on one side, and the
unpopular candidates, backed'by the publicans, on the
other. Of course, every possible political and social
topic has now a chance of being discussed. For in-
stance, the Sunday question ÍB continually being
mooted at the different election meetings, but in a very
few places only are the candidates found sufficiently
bold to declare themselves in favour of the opening of
museums and similar places of recreation on Sundays,
so greatly is public opinion divided on the subject.
Very significant is the unmistakable rebuffs which
the working-class candidates are everywhere expe-
riencing. Although want of money may have had
something to do with their general non-success, the
real obstacle with which they have had to contend is
the popular instinct respecting their utter uafitness
for Parliamentary duties. Take, for instance, the
secularist Bradlaugh, who is now struggling to procure
one of the Beats ocrupied by Charles Gilpin and Lord
Henley at Northampton. Suppose for a moment that he
was returned for that busy_ tow n, what possible informa-
tion could he impart to his fellow-members respecting
the social condition and wants of the working class ?
Absolutely nothing. He is a mere clap-trap speaker.
Mere demagogues are out of place in Parliament.
What is really wasted are men whose character and
abilities shall be of the right kind. That the people
can recognise these, even in a political opponent, is
clearly shown by the cordial reception recently
awarded the Marquis of Salisbury at Manchester.
Ten years ago the idea of a Conservative statesman
being feted by the "" Manchester School "" would have
appeared impossible of realisation. Sut this is the
age of anomalies, and therefore we are surprised
at nothing. Yet the event is not with-
out its importance. It seems to be, to
quote the words of an experienced journalist :
"" One of those incidents which to the future historian
of this country will seem to mark a peaceful revolu-
tion in its political and social relations. It looks as if
the barrier'of strangeness and distrust between the
hereditary territorial aristocracy and the democratic
potentates of an industrial epoch, were breaking
down, end that the great principles which have BO
long been the watchwords of an advanced pirty, were
becoming the common property ot public men of all
parties, orders, and degrees, with any pretensions to
statesmanship."" That Mr. Gladstone will have re
sawed the premiership, with a large majority to sup-
port him, by Christmas, seems to be generally
accepted even by the Tories aa an inevitable fact.
Australian interests bid fair to be pretty well repre-
sented in the new Parliament. Colonel Torren» seems
to have a good chance at Cambridge, Mr. M«Arthur
is safe for Lambeth, and of the other half-dozen can-
didates connected in some way or another with Aus-
tralian matters, not one has even the prospect of
failure.
lhe"" death of the Archbishop of Canterbury has
excited considerably less remark than would have
been the case had the event occurred at a time when
the public mind was not so fully occupied with
political matters. The Archbishop was a good and
kind-hearted man, but scarcely fitted for the im-
portant post which he was called upon to hold. The
nonconformist, a journal not much given to speaking
well of the epifcepacy, commenting on the prelate's
decease, remarks that the Archbishop «' died-after <
conducting the Church, of which he waa the nominal ,
head, with at least great judiciousness, through a I
serien of almost unparalleled troubles-a good and
bumble man. Those who Baw him frequently-and
this, at one time, 'was the case with ourselves-and
those ""who knew him intimately, will both say that he
was a Christian gentleman. Be had gTeat suayity of
manser, but he never produced the impression of
being insincere. ""When one comes to think of it this
is a good deal to say for an Archbishop of Canter
bury, for it is a good deal to say of any man, and
more especially of any clergyman, who has risen to
the highest office in the land. Few could wear the
loftiest mitre without showing some spiritual or, at
any rate, some human pride. The late Archbishop
indicated no vice of this kind."" Never was man
placed in a greater dilemma than is Mr. Disraeli at
ihe present moment. Whatever way he may decide,
he is certain .to create for himself a host of enemies
within the Church.
Among the minor and almost unnoticed indications
of social progress in this country is the gradual dis-
appearance of the once familiar turnpike gatea. The
turnpike-road system seems to have been a complete
failure. It was as bad as the French octroi, without
any of its advantages. True, the main roads were
often maintained in pretty good order, but the side
thoroughfares were invariably neglected ; and, how-
ever pleasant might be our green country lanes on a
bright sunny day, a shower of rain sufficed to
speedily render them almoBt impassable. Travellers
using vehicles or horses were heavily taxed, at the
same lime the revenue thus raised was totally insuffi-
cient for the purpose for which it was required, the
consequence being an enormous amount of debt, the
interest m which at the present time consumes a
considerable percentage of the sums annually raised
by the taxation of those making use of the roads on
which the toll-gates still exist. The management of
the vrious turnpike trusts appears to have fallen into
the hands of the legal profession, to whom they have
proved almost as rich a source ot wealth as has the
Chancery Cturt itself. To rescue the different trusts
from the grasp of the lawyers, and afterwards to re-
place the system of turnpike tolls by one based on the
plan of a county rate, has been the object of those
endeavouring to sting about a better state of things.
In this they are proving very successful, the chief
difficulty being the vast amount of debt with which
the various trusts are encumbered. Indeed, so great
is the progress made, that it is probable the day is not
very far distant when the millennium of the children of
Rebecca shall have arrived, and not a toll-gate be
known in the kingdom. The effects of the abolition
of the turnpike system on local traffic will be im
menee, rspecially in agricultural districts where it has
long impeded the development of agricultural enter-
prise and improvements.
The reappearance of distress in the eastern metro-
politan districts has again directed public attention to
the subject of emigration. The recent American mail
informs us that ""An 'Immigration Convention,' in-
tended to unite in one body all the societies through-
out America, formed for the encouragement of immi-
gration and the protection of immigrants, has just
been held at Baltimore."" If our Transatlantic brethren
really desire to avail themselves of our surplus labour
thev will have no difficulty in procuring it, but the
majority of English statesmen would, we suspect,
rather behold the stream of labour drifting
towards Australia. The Welch, it may be remem-
bered, have attempted to form a colony in Patagonia.
There seems, after all, a chance of the experiment
turning out satisfactorily, notwithstanding the diffi-
culties with which its promoters have had to contend.
The original idea was to make the settlement purely
Welch in character. This portion of the scheme has
now been abandoned, and the influx ot British
colonists is cordially invited. Ina very short time it
is intended to send out a Church clergyman to the
colony, indeed, an application to that effect has I
already been made by the colonists to the Bishop of
Bangor, a circumstance which has encouraged the
formation of a band of Church people as emigrants for
the new colony. The movement is an extremely im-
portant one. If ever a penal settlement is planted in
the Falklands - and the supposition is not an
unlikely one-a system of graduated punish-
ments will probably be attempted by fixing
another settlement on the Fatagoniun coast,
to which the better class of convicts might
be removed. It certainly would be most
unwise to leave it in the power of Russia or America
to get hold of this important part of the world. Al-
ready a French adventurer claims to be ""King of
Patagonia,'* by election of the native tribes. There
may be more than a madman's trick in this ; it may
be that something of the hocus-pocus principle,
characteristic of the recent Fijian treaty, may have
been practised in this particular case. A settlement
half-way between Australia and England would be
invaluable to us, both nationally and commercially.
Providence has evidently handed over the southern
zone to British colonisation, and the presence of an
Anglo-Saxon element in South America may do
much towards remedying the misrule and neglect
by which an effete Spanish race have so-
long closed that large and beautiful country
against the advancing wave of emigration. That
the emigration movement may ultimately become
diverted to the South may be inferred from a very
remarkable paper, by Mr. C. H. Pearson, on "" The
Land Question in the ""United States,"" in which it is
contended that the wholesale manner in which Ame-
rican capital is being invested in American land will,
within the next twenty years, cause the stoppage of
the facilities and inducements at present held by
""United States emigrants. He also tells us that "" the
future of our colonies is in their own hands, that the
land reserve of which they dispose is one that may
easily be exhausted, and that in ""Victoria a cry against
any encouragement to fresh emigrants is already a
watchword with the popular party."" Comfortable
thinking this, eh? But what are we to do if the
rest of the world is to be closed against our surplus
population? "" Teach the people,"" says Mr. Pear-
son, and remember "" if the work be not done within
the next twenty years, it is just possible that our
children may have to maintain order, and whatever
makes up society, by the sword."" Perhaps it will
not be quite so bad as that. At least, we hope not.
It is, however, not very encouraging to those
desirous of founding new enterprises in the Southern
hemisphere, to read the accounts of the recent pro-
ceedings in connection with the attempted winding
up of the Panama, New Zealand, and Australian
Boyal Mail Company. The Times calls attention to ?
the circumstance "" that the course of post between
this country and New Zealand and Australia, via
Panama, has now been reduced to less than four
months,replies to the letters which left Southampton
on the 2nd of July having been received on the 27th
instant, a period of only 117 days. Of this,' 22 days
and nine days respectively were afforded in New Zea-
land and Sydney for answering letters, the time occu-
pied on the through voyage each way between
Wellington and Southampton being 47¿ days, and
between Sydney and Southampton 54 days.""
The publication of this statement has tended to
revive public confidence in the possible future
prosperity of the enterprise, should the desire of the
gieat body of creditors be complied with. This desire
is that ""the company should be continued, there
being every reason to believe that the undertaking
can be worked with profitable results."" There exists
also a general impression amongst all interested in
such matters that if the various suggestions made by
Mr. Cave, M.P., at the recent extraordinary general
meeting of the Company, were carried out, they would
result in complete success. It is a significant circum-
stance that at the recent half-yearly meeting of the
Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, an opinion was
expressed by the shareholders that proceedines
adverse to the Panama, New Zealand, and Australian
Royal Mail Company should be avoided, and that, as
the service across the Pacific contributes to the re-
ceipts of the Boyal Mail Company, increased facilities
should be afforded for developing the traffic with the
Australasian colonies. In the report of the same
Company, just issued, allusion is made to the finan-
cial difficulties of the Panama Company, and a hope
is expressed that this service will be continued, as it
has been -worked with great regularity, and has of
course brought traffic to the Royal Mail Company.
Ihe fatewell dinner to Sir James Fergusson, the
new Governor of South Australia, at Willis's Rooms,
was a great success, If Sir James only creates as
favourable an impression at the Antipodes as he did
at the banquet, the South Australians will
have no cause to regret his arrival. He
spoke with much good sense, and seemed perfectly
wwe of the responsibilities attached to his new
office. Although his Conservative views have acted
as a hindrance to his gaining popularity here, people
have not forgotten his presence in the Crimea, and
how he wa» wounded at the battle of Inkermann.
Mr. Disraeli certainly might have made a worse
appointment.! The dinner itself was a brilliant affair,
as such celebrations generally are, especially when
held at Willis'sJRooms. Among the features of the
evening was the .? loving cup "" filled with real South
Australian wine, scarcely distinguishable from the best
claret. Whether Australian beef or mutton graced
the tables neither gntsts nor waiters seemed to know.
But then your real cook is such a genius. We do
not always know what we eat.
A collision at the mouth of the Thames, whereby
the Leichhardt, a ship boundj from London to New
i ¿«aland, was run down and sunk by the steamer
North Star, has revived the public interest in the
subject of the increasing number of disaster, at sea.
The Board of Trade has ordered an inquiry into the
matter, it being asserted that the pilot in charge of the
steamer was drunk. To call the affair a collision
set ms a misuse of the word. As a morning journal
very truly remarks, "" the case for the assessors of the
Boord of Trade in the matter of the Leichardt and the
North Star is as simple as a ease of assault in a police
court, when a drunken passer-by has knocked down a
sober and inoffensive person standing still on the
public pavement."" Has it ever entered the heads of
insurance companies and shipowners that a consider
able proportion of the losses incurredby them may
have arisen fi om the intemperate habits of those in
charge of their vessels ? It is to be feared that drun-
kenness is as terrible in its destructive effects on
sea as well as on land. The captain, no leas than
the common seaman, is not above the temptation,
offered by the brandy bottle, and in too many caaes
a cargo of gunpowder, would be far less dangerous
than is the presence of a barrel of rum in the ship's
hold. It is a significant fact, that the proportion of
voyages safely made by temperance captains-and
there are many such-is double, and even treble, that
made by their drinking brethren. If the rum bottle
were banished from aboard ships, the number of
shipping disasters would speedily become dimin-
ished.
But the drink-demon is persecuting us even more
heavily on land, for to its influence ia directly traceable
much of the pauperism with which we are cursed,
and which is daily increasing to such an
extent as to appal all who have become
acquainted with the same. New workhouses, in-
firmaries, asylums for the imbecile poor, and other
institutions, are being erected in all directions, but
the more we provide accommodation the more it
becomes required. Pauperism is increasing faster
than the means of relief, and how it will end no one
dares predict. The new Parliament will be called
upon to solve many questions, but none of auch im-
portance as this. Ihe pressure of local taxation ia
also increasing at a fearful tate. In St. Paneras the
angry ratepayers are up in arms ; in other parishes
the murmur of discontent is daily growing more and
more loud. In Hackney, the"" poor-rates for the
twelve months ending Lady Day, 1868, wore £35,000.
For the six months ending Lady Day, 18G9, they will
be i36,000 ! It is everywhere the same. Tura which
way we will-North, East, West, or South-the
same dismal picture presents itself. What are we
to do ? The new j ear ""will dawn anything but hope-
fully for us. With poverty and disease waiting
sadly at our gate, how are we to enjoy Christmas r
In the presence of this terrible social problem, all
political questions sink into utter insignificance. We
care not whether Ritualists carry on their senseless
mummeries to a greater or lesser extent-we care not
whether my Lord Fiddle-de-dee is to wield the rein»
of political power, or whether they are to be entrusted
to the charge of my Lord Tweedledum ; but we do
care whether or not we are to continue to bear thia
festering canker in our very midst, eating up
our prosperity, and dragging us down from.
the temple of our pride. Would that the
day had arrived when men, forgetting their religious
and political differences, strove to exert themselves to
ameliorate the condition of our poorer brethren. Hoir
mean, contemptible, and ignoble seem all these petty
bickerings about points of religious doctrine or arti-
cles of political faith, in presence of tho dark cloud
which is beginning to gather over our social fortunes.
If men would but imbibe a little more of the true
spirit which animated Him, whose birthday will
before these lines are being read beneath the Southern
Cross-have been celebrated with gladness and joy
throughout the civilised wotld, we might hope for
better thingB. And yet, what right have we to
despair.

To the Editor of the Herald.
Sir,- The circumstances attending the doings of this gang
of murderous villains at Binda, on the 21st ultimo, as re-
ported in the Goulburn Herald of the 28th and re-published
in your journal of the 30th, have increased the wonder (if,
indeed that were possible), which has been expressed
throughout the colony, at the utter incapability of the
mounted and foot police force to cope with and capture, or
shoot down a few audaious, but cowardly ruffians, who
have, for a considerable time past, been engaged in murder-
ing residents or passengers in the districts, and then
miscreants are harboured; and in plundering, and then
destroying the stores and homesteads of the industrious
settlers, besides robbing the mails, drays &c.
This last outrage almost surpasses any that has yet been
recorded. Binda is a thriving post town ans police station,
in the Goulburn district.Early in the evening of the day
in question, Hall and his gang went to the store of a very
respectable man, named Morriss, and ordered himself and
his wife to dress and accompany them to the Flag Hotel,
where a ball was to take place,to which the landlord had
invited upwards of a hundred of the townspeople. This
order they were obliged to obey, and whilst so engaged the
gang secured about £ 1oo, which was in the store. Arriv-
ing at the hotel, they ordered the terrified household and
guests to go on with the dancing, in which they themselves
joined with the most reckless audacity. Morriss, who was
formerly a very active officer of police, saw that could he
but obtain the assistance of a few resolute men amoung
the visitors, the three villains could be successfully rushed
upon and captured, notwithstanding their being heavily
armed. About three o'clock in the morning, the required
assistance having been solemnly promised, the rush was to
be made. But vile treachery was at work; Hall and Gil-
bert were warned of the plan to seize them, and they imme-
diately advanced towards Morriss, each presenting a revolver
at him. By a sudden movement he leapt out of the window,
being fired at without effect. He, with the greatest speed,
made for the spot wher the horses of the gang were tied
up, and mounting one, galloped off pursued by the bush-
rangers, who fired several shots at him, which he
fortunatley escaped. Baffled in their pursuit,they
returned to the hotel and having declared to
those present their intention to burn Morriss's
store and stock-in-trade, they left the house
in order to carry out their threat, although Mrs.
Morriss clang to them in desperation and implored them
not to burn down her home. They went to the store, and
having again searched for money, they set fire to the pre-
mises, and in the course of a very short time the stores, the
valuable stock, a number of promissory notes, and the ac-
count books were entirely consumed.
Mr Morriss having concealed himself until he saw the
villains leave the spot,returned to the store, where he found
his wife lying in the agonies of grief on the ground before
the ruins of their building. Again mounting a horse, Mr
Morriss pushed on to Goulburn to report this outrage to the
police.On his arrival at the barracks he was informed that
the Superintendent was absent, and two hours were
lost by the mounted troopers in searching for
him, before pursuit was begun! This assuredly in a case
of scandalous neglect of duty, which demands immediate
investigation by the authorities.
We are informed that Mr Morriss applied to be imme-
diately readmitted into the police force, and sent in search
of the gang, but that the superintendent coldly said he
had no power to appoint him, but would accept his services
as a volunteer.
Having thus in as brief a space as possible, recapitulated
the incidents attending the outrage, the neglect of the
police, and the spirited offer of Mr Morriss, I will, with
your permission, offer a few words in regard to these start-
ling matters.
In his admirable speech at the Camdon Banquet, on the
28th ultimo, Mr James Macarthur asked "" Why should
not there be volunteers to put down bushrangers' He
would wage war with these desperadoes; he should consider
it a disgrace to live in a district that was infested by them.
Years ago he had gone out after the bushrangers himself in
company with the then clergymen of Campbelltown, and
other persons. He hoped this bushranging would be put
down, because it was doing the colony an infinitude of mis-
chief at home; it was turning immigration away from our
shores.
It is to be hoped that these remarks, from one of the most
influential of our colonists, will not be overlooked by the
Government, but that so brave a man as Morriss should be
at once invited to form a resolute volunteer party, to be
properly mounted, and furnished with the best arms, and
abundanee of ammunition, and further provided with orders
forrations on the settlers, to be paid for by the Treasurer.
By this means, there is little doubt that the hangman
would not much longer be robbed of his due , and that the
murderous ruffians,who have so long resigned with im-
punity,in districts where they have been harboured or
concealed by confederates, would be very quickly traced to
their haunts and handed over to the administers of those
laws which they have so long defied.
With regard to the heavy loss sustained by Mr.
Morriss-upwards of £1000-I can only express an earnest
hope that public subscription lists will be opened in every
town of the colony, not only to reimburse lhim for his
losses but also to present him with an honourable testi-
monial, as a tribute to his bravery.

Mr. R. Black, M.L.A, addressed a meeting last night in
the Theatre. Mr. R. Stear, the Mayor, presided, and
there was a good attendance. Mr. Black explained satis-
factorily why he had not taken part in the debates. He
thought payment of members militated against their inde-
pendence. He was in favour of local government, and
would advocate a lower railway rate for farm produce, and
the extension of the railway from Mudgee to Gulgong. A
vote ot confidence was unanimously passed in Mr. Black.
Mr. Black afterwards mot the Railway League committee,
and promised his support, but advised them to continue them-

A lai go audience assembled in tho Frosty terian Church,
Regent-slreot, Redfern, to hear Mr. H. A. Long, of Glasgow
G reen, deliver ono of tho serios of lectures which ho has
given in this city. Tho meeting was prosided overbythoHon.
Dr. Ronwick, who in thecourseof his introductory remarks
said Mr. Long had made his mark au an tinti-infidol
lecturer and preacher of the Gospel in Glasgow, and during
his stay in Australia he bad done his best to uphold tho
grand old Christian faith, and ho had spoken out boldly
against all forms of unbelief. In these days, said tho
speaker, when freedom of thought was so lnrgolypormitted,
sometimes that freedom ran into liconso ; nnd when they
considered what occurred occasionally in tho high places of
tho land, and among those who should know hotter, not
only in Parliament, but in other piucos, thoy should bo
glud to know that there wero men uko Mr. Long who
endeavoured to uphold the causo of truth and right. Tho
lecturer then delivered an address on the Hobrow word
"" Chabod,"" which, he pointed out, siemificd in tho English
language weight, substance, or glory, and wont on to show
that, as tho Israelites carno out of Egypt with plenty of
this world's goods in fho shape of jowols and cattlo, which
wits their substanco and their .glory, or their "" Chabod,""
so m like manner tho belief in tho true faith would have
external glory in heaven. A collection was taken up at
tho close of tho discourse in aid of Mr. Long's mission.
SHIPS : THEIR DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION.
In connection with the Board of Technical Education,
Mr. Walter Reeks, teacher in naval architecture at tho
Technical College, and well known as a naval architect
in this city, delivered n lecture on tho above subject at the
lecture hall of tho School of Arts on Friday last to on
audience ' of over 300 persons. Aftor a few preliminary
remarks, in which the lecturer explained that in au
hour it was not possiblo to do moro than sketch
fho^merest outline of tho subject, ho went into
tho question of water and its lfflat'ton to ships,
treating at some length the element of resistance duo
to friction between the Water! and a ship's bottom, explain-
ing why copper is used for shoathing purposes, viz., on
account of its exfoliating purposes, and not ns is some-
times supposed, because it is too poisonous for weeds, &c.
to grow upon it. Other elements of resistance were ex-
plained by sketches on the blackboard, chiefly tho
disturbance of the water, known as wave making.
Floatation and stability woro spoken of and
illustrated in as lucid a manner as time permitted of. In
concluding Mr. Reeks ran through a list of the chief
considerations in ship-designing, and again reminded his
heuroi s of tho fact that ho had only touched on n very few
points of the subject, but said all these things would bo
worked out in detail at tho class in naval architecture of
tho Technical College in Sussox-street.
Tho lecture wns hi ought to n close by lantern views illus-
trating tho riso and development of ship-building from the
canoe dug out bv fire from tho trunk of an oak to tho

It has como to our knowledge that a roport hns boon indus-
triously circulated by somo dishonest person to tho effect
that the CLARET, CHABLIS, SAUTERNE, and other
WINES imported and sold by us, with a label bearing the
above mark,,nnd tho name of A. VIGOTJROUS undor
neath, aro composed partly or wholely of colonial winos,
and that tho cases, bottles, &o. aro imported empty ! ! and
filled hero. However ridiculous this may appear to mer-
cantile men, and those possessed of tho modorato amount of
knowledge necessary to enable them to distinguish French
from Australian wines, it may mislead others. Wo will
therefore pay £50 to any person who will givo us such infor-
mation as shall lead to tho conviction for slander of the
originator of this report.
To set at rest any fin thor doubt on this subject, wo havo

in tho same stato as roportod yesterday, tho only
offers being 107 for Now South Wales long-dated

The Import markets were not quite so aotivo, as
speculative inquiry seemed to have ceased, but thora
was some business douo in trade lines at about lato
rates. Brcadstuffs quiet. Sellers of Adolaide wheat
nt Cs., and primo Now South Wales offored at 5s. 9d.
Thero was no chango in flour, and values are likely to
bo maintained until now crop comes to hand. Thero is
a demand for vessels to load wheat in South Australia for
England at a considerable advance, and this will not
improvo tho value of wheat. Cement is not quite so
¿firm, as one of the largest holders is disposed to quit at
a concession on recent quotations. Dried fruits llrmcr,
especially Elcmo and Sultana raisins ; figs aro so scarce'
that quotations may bo regarded as nominal.
There was inquiry for malt, resulting in sales of
Euglish at 10s. to 10s. 3d. Wo also heard
of a salo of Kent hops, of this soason's crop,
to arrive, from Molbourno, at a figuro withhold. Thero
¡was some business done in liquors for trado purposes.
Brandies firmer, some holders asking up to 9s. öd. for
second-class- bulk, and to 80s. case; a lino of all
[hogsheads sold at 8s. Whisky in demand, 17s.
paid for Dunvillo's caso, and 5s. Od. for
bulk. Galvanized iron, tinplates, and sheet
lead held at advanced values. Tho market for
6ugars remains strong at the lato advance. Brewers
crystals scarco and hold for a considerable riso. Thero
is an upward tendency in teas, and so far as present
indications can bo relied upon, values are certain to
advance. So far as can bo ascorlained, there is not
moro than 050,000 lbs. yet to arrive at this port of last
crop. Un the wharfs this morning business was very
dull. The supplies ave nil coming in heavily, and
these, with the already ]are,c stocliB on hand, aro fairly
g1 utting tho market. Day is no exception to the
general rule. Lucerno is coming to hand in large
quantities, and prices will not sustain themselves.
Tho present quotation for prime is from ¿3 15s. to
£-1, at which prico there is not much inquiry, and
medium quality is very dull of sale at from £8 to ¿'8
10s. Oaten hay on tho wharfs is of very inferior
quality, and tho best offered only fetched from
£3 to ¿3 10s. Potatoes of the new crop ate coming
to hand more freely, and tho quotation lins lowered
considerably, from £4 10s. to £5 10s. ruling at pre-
sent, limiter River onions aro worth £9 to £10.

Tho estimates of probablo expenditure for 1880
wore laid before tho Legislativo Assembly this evening,
in anticipation of tho financial statement expicted to be
mado to-morrow. Tho total departmental disburse-
ments aro proposed to amount to £4,011,98317s. lOd.,
against £4,194,U8C 11s. 2d. for 1879, and the
special appropriations to £972,200, or £174,200
moro than last year, thus bringing up
the total to £4,99L\G8(J for 1879, i4,984,183
for 1880. Thero is a largo decrease in tto proposed
expenditure of the Works Department, but it is com-
pensated for by increases connected with th« Railways
and Post Office. The Treasurer and Seootary for
Lands ask for less, and tho Minister of Justice is to
have £14,825 more, but in other directions here is not
much change. An additional expenditure o: £127,999
is also to be asked for, to be defrayed out of surplus
revenue, and this sum includes £40,000 adiitional ex-
penses of the International Exhibition.
Messrs. Harrison, Jones, mid Devlin w11 offer to-
morrow, by auction, at their new wool warehouso,

I TO TUE EDITOR OP TUR IÎEKALD. I
Sir,-Last week our Parliament' refused tn trust tho
peoplo to dpcido whether thoy wanted any publfohoueei or
not. The principio is recognised us to now licences. If tho
public aro fit judges of thrir wants us to thom, why should
they not bo equally so aB to existing onns ?
A resolution, as passed in tha House of Commons, has
been defiberately/ojoctcd boro. Prior to tho tronoral olection
o£ 18S0 it had benn lost in England, but the Liberal electors
then turned tho scale. In Juno 1S80 it waa carried by a
majority, including paira, of 26. In tho noxt year it was
ro-afiirmod by u majority of '12, or nearly double. Lust
year,-on tim ""27th April, it was «gain ro-nüTruied by a
iuiijority which hod doubled-87. Sir 'Wilfrid Lawton,
Burt, was tho movor on each occasion, and on tho last Mr.
Giudaftmo \oted with him. 1 freely acknowledge tho
Vroinier'B pinn of full local option differs frprn the views of
tho main body of Sir Wilfrid's followers ; but his voto,
which hore must have bosn on Mr, Abigail's sido, clcatly
supports, the great principio ns to the ronowul us well os tho
issue oE lieentes. Mr. (Jlndatono paid he "" had always claimed
to be an Hdvooato of tho principle of loc*l option, and yet
ho had voted for the provious question formeily, because
ha was uoluropurcd with a plan for applying thopnnoiplo. . .
it was an ofsential part of local government. . . Thoy
wero no longer in a position to ie«it-t tho adoption of the
words of tua bon. Baronet."" Mr. Gladstone'« proposal lo
gue tho lfcnsmir power to municipal representatives inn
Local Government Bill ifould, by the eutaoglement of other
maltors with tho drink question, ptovo nnínlisfiictory.
There are many signs that he will havo to propo=e a plan
mora in accordauco with ihn views ot Parliament, unless ho
courts dofeftf. Sir 'Wilfrid Lawson has ali through
Btrougly advocated a plobiscile. Cannot thona who earned
tho resolution before Mr. Gladstone voted with them insist
on another plan? MucIiImb been mado out of Mr. Glad-
stone's position. It but little affects, however, I ho otn
phatic endorsement by the House of full local option as the
right of a fiea people. It is plain that in England matters
of detail only remaiulor settlement.
It is obùotcti that full locil option is contrary to tho
spitit of ihe Constitution. Would not tho saino objection
apply to partial local oplian ? (¡nu a right of tho kind gi von
by Parliament to tho people bo unconstitutional ? In
Canuda full local option is law. A plubmclt« is to bo taken
when demanded hy a fifth of the electors in any loonlity.
Tha Marquis of Lomo, who Bigned tha Act, would bo
surprised to loam it was unconstitutional. In England
a distinct issuo is legal on sivcral qvioâtions. Tho
Borough Eucd* Act of 1872, for instance, enables
ratnpavors to demand a ballot on-a proposed tax. An
exiimplo of its working occurred in Manchester. A
plentiful supply of water was needed ior the city. Tffirl
mero, a muguidcont Cumberland liiko, was tho only good
available source ot supply. Tho cost to bring tho water to
Manchester was nearly tv.o millions. Under tho Act a volo
was taken when about 30,000 personspolled,jmd the answer
I was Yes. Waa this unconstitutional '< What moro do local
opfioniats rcquiro than a law which will permit us distinct
un issue as that ?
Much has boen said îegarding compensation, a matter
which should not stand in tho way ol tho public good.
It is a side issue, which, wben;Purliamnnt accords thopi'oplo
thu right ndvooatcd, ought to bo fairly and fully diaciiBsed,
us thor, is much to ho mud on both Bides. When, however,
iu Canuda tho number of licenses was reduced nnd limited

Mrst of April Homestead I ease 8d | 3 Hnv North, on certain
conditions ineludlii), pat nient of rent Jd 2-5ths pir acre, against
which I urgeutlt protest
The Act 1884 fixed tho minimum at one penny per acre and
when opplving for lease I In common with m int others thought
that would be t'ic rent for waterless almost treeless country. A
stupid la» takes aw i} right of appeal execpl against the lower
charge but e innot destro} | rlvllet,c of protest
Altho igh it compels me to pat £5""0 l""s 3d for a waterhole,
dry In lebruart and fenelng of little value! now on ground
Also ci mptib the erection of aslx-wiro boundar) fence involv-
ing inoutlaj oi£/00 to ¿SOO, or half cost when divided with
neighbours
lholiw of neccsBitt (not tho Act) compels further provision
for water, and th election of a homestcud that means a further
expenditure of ¿I00 to 1300
Hie whole to be confiscated at end of lease, according to
'law »s now ma le
These am Hints with interest represent three (3) pence per acre
rcdemi tton for 13 tears

1 our v iluer sot the (.raring ui|>ucltv at one sheep to five acres,

t ou lint c it in ct i lence from lessee of run that with one sheep to

I rcBpecttulIt urge tint tou will b plciscd to reconsider thl»,
with n vlow to reiluctlon of rent an I modlfting some of the con-
dition» relating to homestead lcsieos, considering they will be
improt ing the public estate for the next generation If the
Gorenimcntdemrc to settle the country with people, land need»

W Ith a rent charge of -s Id to 3s per sheep for sustenance,
addod to all other charges and risks, no lessee can livo in the
rabbit-infested part of the south portion of W ellem land dis-
trict
Tho land and the careless administrators of it place the home-
stead lessee in worse i osltlon than the pastoral lci«oc, for
though von charge the latter an arbitrary and In some cases
unjust rent the law docs not corni el him to put on Improve

Tho Chairnmu called upon tho head master to
address tho audience
Mr Er-VEST T HOBSON, B A , tho head master,
gavo a rcsumt of tho past year Ho Haul it had
been for all of thom a rather trying yeai lot, from
tho way in which tho school had hoon sup
nortoj, nothing wrcicua bid happened« Turu
ing from the darker to what ho termed
the brighter side, there had beon a good deal of evi-
dence that the old, if he might so term thom, mstitu
tiona of the school had been successfully car-
ried on, and ono or two now ones in-
augurated Ihey would And at the bottom
of the prize list, ""RcwardB for good work
and conduct "" Ihey thought it would be a good
featuie to let parents know that their boys were
working well, and he was certain that the institution
had done good In this way tho masters got a good
deal of support from the home, and he especially
asked motho-s not to forgot what a groat influence
thoy could exert, not only on the boys' In es morally,
bnt intollectuallv as well Ho would like to be able
to put into every parent's hands the Hon A Little
ton's book entitled "" Mothers and bo»s "" After
speaking of the success of the school us indicated in
the ropoits of the eiammations, ho referred to tho
dosirability of supplementing tho school work by
courses of carpentry and physical sciences, for in a
country lil o this they wanted men who could uBe
their 'hands rs well ns their heads
JIa did not say that *hev should throw
ovor intellectual studies thoy should rather go
into thom with groator keenness but what ho did
sty was that, whilst teaching the languages and his-
tory of the past they should ondcavoui to do as littlo
useless work as possible Ho was convinced that
thoj could fe ni for moro reading of classical authors
-Latin nnd Greek-ami less composition That was
if the University would bo content w ith less compost
tion Thoy would then not lind pooplo standing up and
saying that tho classics w ero ofteto and no good He
thought it was the duty of the school to undertake
the manual as well as mental training and to turn
out tho boys entrusted to their caro as perfect meu as
it was possible to do He concluded hy paying a
high tributo to tho assistant masters for their loyal
co-oporation during the year (Applause )
Admiral BOWDEN-bMiTii then distributed the
prizes, tho recipients not only receiving commonda.
tion lrom lum, but wero heaitily choerod as thoy
went forward Tho Admiral thou said that, whilst
feeling the honour tho council had done lum
in asking lum to proscnt the prizes, he wished
that the person invited had hid more knowledgo of
school lifo than he had had Ho joined the navy in
IS.JJ, and at that time the boys who joined went
straight to sea, and he had a very lively recollection
of his fathor taking him down to Portsmouth aid
leaving him ou boord the Vwtory, JSTel»on's own
ship, and soon after he was sent off to the Ei3t
Indies However, on the Britannia, latot on, ho
picked up something of scheol ways and Behool
customs, and the proceedings of that day re-
minded bun voiy much of what used to
tako place at Dartmouth at the distribution of
prizis to tho cadets Ho was very pleased to .lotice
tho great progress that school hud mado since its
opening only a fon years ago, and ho was glad te see
that manly oiercieos woro well kept up, for he
believed they were highly necessary for de
veloping the muscles a»d occupying spare
timo, eo long as thev did not take the place of more
useful things Ho had mentioned the word ""homo,""
and he might say that nothing had surprised lum
moro than te hear people who were born out here
speaking abtut England as home It was vory
pleasing to him to hear the old country spokeu of ¡u
that n ay (Cheers ) Ho hoped that tho feeling
would exist, not only in Australia, but
m overy other English community After
all, this was the country of their adoption,
and therefore it should be their happiness
and pleasure to do all they could to dovelop its re
sources (Applause ) Ho concluded by expressing
the wish that thoy would have a \ory pleasant
Christmas and enjoyablo holidays, and that
thev would all do their best to try to
inako it, if it nore not now, tho very best school
m Australia, for their future depended very much
ou their own exertions (Applause )
Tho CHAIRMAN said thev thanked the Admiral for
being there and distributing the prizes, and re-
turned him all tho good wishes ho bad ex
pressed towards them Ho was sorry t»
sa} that Ins (tho Primate's) fnond, the Rev II L
Jackson, M A , had boon obliged to leavo ¡sydney for
a timo on account of his health, and therefore to
resign the position of honorarj secretary, in which
ho had spa'ed neither time nor trouble (Applause )
Mr H Newham had beenolocted honorary secretary
in Mr Jackson's place Ho (lho chairman) con-
gratulated the school upon the success that had boon
spokeu of, and wished it mental, physical, and moral
progress, und that the pupils attending it
should grow up good, tfio sort of young
men who woro needed to he the pioneers
statesmen, and good householders and heads of
families He could not wish a better thing for thom,
and for this land ot Australia, than that the mllu
euco »f home sympathies should bo ulways with
them and that « hen the} woro in tho position where
thoy could exercise parental sy mpatnj thoy would in
thu same wa} give that svmpatny (Applause )

TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD.
Sir,-The'subject upon which I havo the honour to
address you will, I fool sflre, commend itself to j-our atten-
tion and consideration,, dealing as it does at once with a
public danger, and with the misorable and forlorn condition
of n large Boctiou of the community, with a view to ns far
possible avert the one nnd ameliorate tho latter. . Darling-
hurst gaol covora an area of ground extending over about
4J acres, and is bounded on all sidos bj- well-populuted
districts, cepccinllj- on the north and east. When it was
first erected I. havo no doubt that it was spacious and
convenient enough to suit tho purpose for which it was
intended; it was also sot in what was thon a very
sparsely peopled locality, but now all tho -conditions are
altered. With a great increase of population, and a pro-
portionate extension of tho city, the metropolitan prison
accommodation is inadequate to meet the demands made on
it, consequently it is, and has been for a long timo punt, in
a state of overcrowding, that has frequently been a subj'eot
of anxious discussion between myself nnd the other officials
of the prison depnrtmont. This overcrowding is not onlj'
dangerous to the health of the confinées, but a serious
menace to the community hi tho event of epidemic
disease breaking out in the gaol. In such a case there
would bo everything to favour its diffusion, whon we con-
sider tho present insanitary state of the city, the scarcity of
water, and the consequent itnporfeetflushingof drains, each
in itself a factor in producing disease. Hitherto the gaol
has been, through uto care and vigilanco of those who have
the inauagenisnt of it, singularlj- free from such outbreaks ;
but the greatest attention nnd most admunblo keeping may
not always havo powor to secme such immunity, and there-
fore 1 venture to suggest a means of relieving this prison
repletion. Tho presout unsatisfactory state of things is duo
moro te tho lack of prevision for the* paupor class (han i to
nnj- great increase in crime, and the indifference to this fact
is not only a reproach to the public, but n danger to the
State, resulting, as it docs, not only in tho overcrowding of
our prisons, but in the manufacture of habitual criminals.
Beforo I proceed to formulate the suggestion referred to
I shall eivo h few statistics, bearing directly on the subject.
On tho 31st December last there wero confined m Darling-
hurst gaol no fewer than 317 prisoners, viz., 660 men, and
157 women. From n return supplied me, I find that on tho
20th Def-niber last, the daily averngo of vagrants (i.e., the
pauper class) was 149, or"" nearly one-fifth of tho total
number of inmates in gaol. Again, from 1st Januurj-,
1S85, to November 30, 1885, (lie total number of persons
cn..vieted of vagrancy and drunkenness, includingreconvic
tions, nmoimted to 4079. Theso figures show conclusively the
necossity for some alteration in tho existing btuto of things,
and the remedv I submit Iles either in providing a piuco of
detention for short-sontenco prisonors, i.e., drunkaids and
vagrants, or, better still, a workhouse. I um aware tlmt
the vciy mention of the latter is suflicient to miso tho objec-
tion of, "" Whv-, in a prosperous community, where there
aro work and wages for all, should such au institution be
initiated ? "" However that maj* be, the hard fact remains,
that in any country, however vvoullhy or flourishing, "" the
poor wo havo always with us,"" and i havo during the past
seven j'ears seen hundreds of persons, for no other reason
than utter ¡nubility lo obtain °means of subsistence, com-
mitted to gaol, ' thero to herd with the most
abandoned criminals, and undergo, in consequence,
a courso of . contamination, resulting in their
being gradually absorbed into the vicious and
hardened class alluded to: Many years ugo the Chief
Justico Sir Janies Martin foresaw this contingency whon
ho introduced his Workhouso Act of 1866, which was re-
pealed in 1869. Tho necessity ot somo arrangement for tho
relief of indigence is so manifest that one French Minister
enunciated tho proposition, "" That no ono has a right to
public relief, but that the bestowal of such relief is a duty
lnnumbent on the State."" Sweden, Doumnrk, nnd Russia
havo conferred upon all destitute persons the right to
necessary relief. Tho Dutch law of 1870 lays down thai
"" no person has a right to relief ; that the ciro of the poor
is a moral, not a civil duty ; tbat tho exercise of charity
should bo relegated to tho Church, or to privato sources ¡i
but where theso agencies do not exist it may becoino neces-
sary to the Stato to intervene in tho interests of public
decency and order.""
Fovvle, in. his work on the Poor Law, says:-""All uro
agreed, whatever may be the reason they give for their
conclusion, that indigence must bo relieved by some ono or
other, and at the cost of the community, bv whatever name
we choose to call tlio process by wbicb the relief is con
voi-ed. This bivi- or fact we may express in the following
torus :-That every society upon arriving at a certain stage
of civilisation finds it positively necessary, for its own
humanity, ond for the due performance of tho purposes for
which societies exist, to provide that no person, no matter
what has been his life, or what may be tho consequence,
shall porish for wunt of the bnre necessaries of life. What
we may call the moral life of the community is incom-
patible with the spectacle of unrelieved indigence connived
at bj- the comfortable and prosperous classes. This refer-
ence"" to the nutural Operation of humanity is a thing duo
from society to its own self-respect, is to be found in nil
the reasons which législation or writers have assigned us
being the principal poor-law administration iu their re-
spective countries.""
On this subject J. Stuart Mill also remarks :-"" It will
bo admitted to be right that human beings should help one
another, und the moro so in proportion to the urgency of
tile need, und none needs help so urgently us ono who is
starving. The claim to help therefe-re created bj- destitu-
tion is one of the strongest which can exibt, and there is tho
amplest reason for muking the relief of so extreme an exi-
gency as certain to thoso who require it, as bj- auj- arrange-
ment of bociety it cun be made."" 1 am, etc.,

telligent uso of wise and moderato argument, but this has
no weight with a woman. Thoy uko what they Uko, be-

On tho other hand, it must not be imagined that all tho

A large trado in Sydney is done in floor sweepings, and

quantities
It Is earned on to snch an extent that several of tho largo

Wo think BO too. We bclicvo that by putting upa really

CORONER'S INQUEST.-The inquest on tho body of a
boy, named Henry Joseph Simmons, aged fourteen years,
commenced in the coroner's office on Tuesday, waa
resumed nnd concluded yesterday. It appoared from tho
evidence that the deceased was usually engaged in going
about the town selling paper, envelopes, &c. _ On Tuesday
week he complained to bis father of great pain internally.
The father went to Mr. Abraham, chemist, of George
street, who prescribed a powder. This powdor was admin-
istered, hut to «11 appearances it made tho sufferer worse.
At length, on Saturday la*t, the boy was takon to the In-
firmary, but ho was then in such an exhausted state that
recovery was hopeless Ho was, however, put under treat-
ment, but it had not the desired effect, and he expired oa
the following evening. Dr. Roberts made a post mortem
examination of the body, and found the cause of death to
have been great inflammation of the peritoneum. ""Verdict,
""Died ft oin natuial causes."" Great dissatisfaction waa
expressed that chemists-not proporly_ qualified módica!
men-were allowed to prescribe, and, in case of death, to
give certificates of the cuuse of death without onea seeing
the patient.
THR CAVE TEMPLES or INDIA.-At the monthly meeting
of the Philosophical Society of New South Wales, last night,
in the Australian Library-the prosment of the society in
the chair-a paper of considerable interest was read by Dr.
Bcmca8tle, on tho "" Cave Templos of India,"" which wera
classified under the following heads :-1st, Vinara,) or
monastery caves ; 2nd, Buddhist Cbattya caves ; 3rd,
Brohmanical caves, properly so called. He then described
the rock-cut caves of Elephants, Kannari, Karli, and
Bambourda, which are perhaps tho most remarkable
monumen's of human labour to be met with in
India. The supposed religious origin and uses of these
temples was aleo dwelt upon. Many of them contain
statues of colossal dimensions, and their walls are covered
over with elaborate embellishments of the most fanciful
descriptions. Having noticed some of the rites and ceremo-
nies observed by the worshippers in theso temples, Or.
Berncastle concluded bis very ablo essay, which was list-
ened to with marked intent throughout. A vote ot thanks
from his Excellency Sir John Young, on behalf of the
society, brought the proceedings to a close.

THE CHURCH or MOUNT CARMEL.-Tho bazaar ia
Geofce-street Market, opened on Monday last, was con-
tinued on Tuesday and yesterday, and each day draw toge-
ther a considerable number of visitors, particularly after
business hours, the markot towards evening assuming quito
an animated appearance. The stock of goods begins gra-
dually to diminish, although the'dlfferent articles of fancy
work, exhibited in tempting array, have not moved off so
quickly as could bave been wished, keeping in view tho
laudable object for which the bazaar was got up, vi»., the
clearing off the debt of tho church. Thif evening, wo
understand that an additional attraction will be held out,
the fine band of the Volunteers having very considerately
proffered their services to discourse sweet musio during tha
afternoon and evening. The bazaar opens each day at 10
a.m., closing at the same hour at night, and will be finally
closed on Saturday.
FATAL STREET FIOHT AT WOLLONGONG.-The Illa-
warra Mercury of Tuesday report« as folio #s :-Consider-
able excitement prevailed throughout the town on Sunday
morning, owing to tho report that a mon had been killed
in the neighbourhood of the Settlers' Arms the previoui
night. On inquiry wo unfortunately found it to be too
true. A magisterial investigation was held at the Settlers*
Arms, on Sunday morning, before Messrs. C. T. Smith, and
George Waring. John Musgrave deposed that ho was tho
landlord of the Settlers' Arms lOn Saturday evening, about
seven o'clock, the deceased (Thomas Beddes), accompanied
by two other men, came into his heuse, when deceased called
for three glasses of grog, and offered a cheque in payment.
Witness, however, had no change, and they went away.
About half-past ten at night deceased again called to pay
for the grog. There were three or four persons standing
about the door. A young man named M'Mahon was
amongst them. Deceased and M'Mahon had some words,
when witness told them he was going to shut up, and that
it was better thoy Bhould go home. The deceased and
M'Mahon were very noisy, but witness did not pay much
attention to what they said. After they went outside ho
beard a scuffle. Shortly afterwards witness went outside
to trim the lamp, whou he found deceased lying about threo
yards from the doorway. Witness lifted him up, and car-
ried him indoors, and laid him on the sofa. Deceased did
not speak, and appeared insensible. Witness afterwards
went for Dr. Marshall, but he sent word that he wag
ill in .bed, and had been taking medicino.
When witners returned Boudes was dead. Ha
was not absent more than two minutes. Immediately re-
ported the circumstance to the inspector of police. The
next witness called was John Beattie, who deposed that he
was a carter, and wns present when a dispute took place
between M'Mahon and deceased. Ho was returning from
the shoemaker's with a pair cf boots, and as ho was passing
the Settler's Arms he saw two men came out of the house
and commence fighting with their hands ; they had no
sticks. Witness saw the two mon knock each other down
several times. James M'Mahon wos one of the men that
was fighting, and he believed deceased was the othor.
Thero wero several persons standing by. Witness did not
interfere beyond telling M'Mahon to go home ; he did not
try to part the men, M'Mahon and witness went awav
leaving deceased Ijing on the grouRd. The two men had
been fighting on tho footpath, and it was thore that they
knocked each other down. Androw Downie, blacksmith,
deposed, he was at the Settlers' Arms about eleven o'clock
on Saturday night ; saw M'Mahon and deceased in the bar.
When witness left they wero beginning to
havo a fiw words, but ho went away and did not
know any more about the matter. Goorge Prowd Lambert,
deposed to having made a post mortem examination of de-
ceased. He found tho lungs much congested and en-
gorged with blood; the right auriclo of the hoart was also
lull of blood, otherwise tho heart was sound, the viscera
were healthy. He had examined tho head of deceased, and
found tho membrane of tho brain slightly congested, the
substance of tho brain was healthy ; there woro no exter-
nal marks of violence visible This concluded tho evidence,
and Mr. A, Turner was instructed to forvvurd.tho déposi-
tions to tho Attorney-General, JameB M'Mahon being
meanwhile detained in 'custody. The deceased man,
Thomas Beddes, was married, but had no children.
COTTON AT SHOALHAVEN.-WO havo been favoured
with A sample of cotton grown by Mr, Richardson, at
Shoalhaven. It is what is known as tho New Orleans cot-
ton, We believo it is Mr. Richardson's intention to repeat
the experiment, which has boen go far successful, next
year. It is the effort« of individual experimentalists such
as Mr. Richardson that should bo encouraged, and not
those of large capitalista combined together, who are very
well able to help themselves. It is the general opinion that
a considerable quantity of cotton seed will be in the pos-
session of Mr. Moore, tho Government botanist, before next
spring, for distribution, and we hope, this time next year, to

TO TUB I3DIT01I t)P THU HltltAI.I).
Su IJiav e read with that tttentivc consideration to
which any BtttrAnenfunder the hand of my excellent
and learned friend Mr Alexander Gordon, ib entitled,
the letter which appeared in the Harold ol Saturday
last, on the subject of Orange Asspciationa, and I
desire to ¿tate candidly what effect it has had upon
my own mind and what I believe will be its general
c fleet
That I may not be supposed to be a bigot, in-
capable of calm and rational investigation of the
subject, I may as well say at the outset that I am not
an Orangeman (unless, indeed, to be an honest and
consistent Protestant, a loyal subject, and a good
citizen be the principal elements ot Orangeism), nor
have I ever been a member of any secret society what
ever I have never had a difference with any man on
the subject of his religion, nor ia the ordinary trans
actions of life, or in giving assistance or employment
have I ever been influenced bj the consideration
whether the parties were Protestant or ltomarust
I or the last fifteen years and upwards, I have con
tinuousiy had in my service th.ee or more Roman
C athohes, and I liiv e never made inquiry on the sub
lect of their religion, except for the purpose of afford
uif, them convenient and regular opportunity of
ittendiH¿ confession and the public sen ices of their
Church
But although I am not a member of any Orango
Association there arc icisons which compel me to
look into the evidence upon which the objections to
0nnoei»m are founded, and to be well satisfied as to
their validity betöre I can concur in the denunciation
of suth institutions
It is an luidoubted fact beyond any doubt or
question, that the Orange Associations havo at all times
included amongst their members noblemen, gentlemen,
mid clergymen of every Protestant denomination,
whose learning, ability, pietv, punt) of life liberality
chant) and brotherly kindness to men of every creed
have never been exceeded and I will not I dare not
ujrn the word of any min or upon any re oin
tton of my Parliament or Assembly m the
we riel, withe ut the most eonvmciii¿ evidence
believe tint nil these learned most excellent
dud tmly good men were 6o blinded by bigotry tint
they bec une nul tontimud îiieiiibeis of an associa
non whose amis and objects mid princioles were
vvholh opposed to the teaching of that pure uid holy
religion vi Inch they professed
Hie knovvledae ol the character of such men has
iceustomed me to look upon Oringe ass îeiitions as
religious, loyal and most reputable societies entitled
to the respect and confidence of all good men ind
e&i coally of all t,ood Protestants and unless my
gre itly rcspeettd lnend is able to show that there is
something inherently wrong m the principles of the
institution-th it it is in some respecta opposed to the
te tching of that Church of which he is so distill
gunhctl and useful i member th it it acknowledges
prn eiples or requires approves of, 01 permits in its
ii embers conduct opposed ti the teaching ofthat
Book winch they recognise ns their only rule of faith
I must continue to reDird them with the sime
feelings of respect and confidence is I h eve done
hitherto
It is timte possil le that I m ty hal c very erroneous
»lews of the pin tq les and objecte, of Ornveism but
it so I shall afioril my esteemed fnenel an opportu
nity of setting me right
It is to bo regretted th it instead ef setting before
yrur readers extricts which afford no inform tuon, he
ebel i ot tell them whit Orangeism really is-what are
it« pnneiples ind the objects it is designed to
ucee i push-that he ebel not listinctly point out
v\l at there is in it tint is opposed to he dictates ot
our common Christianity, to loy alt) to our beloved
Queen, and to our dutv as good eiti/ens If he hid
eloi e this, and I had been convmeed that the state
nicnts were-»veil founded I should have |omeel him
nie st hcartilv, and done ill in my power to dis
teuragethem But it is useless for Mr Gordon to
tell any intelligent and thinking men, who know tho
history of the misgov eminent of Ireland foi the 1 ist
century, that it has been the vvcik, vacilUum0 mis
tiktn and miserable policy of a government who,
ben "" incapable of dealing with the gnev mees thtt
leallv existed soubht from time to time to appease
the clamour of the Horn mists, which they could
not otherwise sitisfy by trying ulmost beyond human
eneluraneo, the loyalty and obedience to law of the
1 rotcstants of that country until at length, by their
last act of despoiling them of that property which the
¡state never gave, thev haye aroused i spirit which
they -will lind it difficult to allay Let me brmg
under the notice of Air Gordon the language of our
own beloved and truly Piotcstant Bishop in his last
charge, where, in speaking of the Irish Church, he
says -
W c in this colony shall not be unmindful that we
arc raerrber3 of the United Church ol Lngland and
Ireland, and shall, I trust, remember the Irish
portion of the United C burch ol England in our
prayers Lvil times have come upon it, and a
Chinch which in these later years has borneare
mul ibte and faithful witness *o the truth ii i/i
ilanyti of being sacrificed io gratify personal and
j olitical ambition The people oj Ireland have no juU
i une of complaint against the /ruh ( huron Roman
tallolits did net Jound it Roman Catholics do not
¡ian lain it and while the proposed disen
dowment of the Irish Church is uuconsti
tutioi al and dii/onest, it is also a mistaken
and useless surrender of a scriptural institution, in
the vain hope ot propitiating an implacable toe le is
i ""rent national calamity Sion of high character and
ot undoubted benevolence are ally ing themselves to
the idolatrous sy stem of the Church of Home, and are
thus making 'hat possible which without their aid
eould never have been accomplished Hie plea is
that Ireland may be pacified Ireland would be at
i cet it aDitatois would allow her to be so One w ould
think that his'orv had never been wntten Did the
Church of Home ever willingly accept any articles of
peace but those which gave lier the entire supremacy
of nund, and soul, anti body Did any pokey ot
conciliation ever satisfy that Cnurch, or was not that
which was granted made the basis of fresh demands
""What solemn vows and promises were heard when
the repeid ot Romish disabilities was sought ' what
confident hopes expressed-as, for example, by the
late Dr Clialuiers, who is reported to have said,
' lhat, with the Bible in one hand and the Roman
Catholic Relief Bill in the other, Ireland would
speedily be conv erted to the Protestant faith
It would have been cantUd if Mr Gordon had told
us that which is as much a certain matter ot his
tory as the Parliamentary speeches and lcsolutions to
which helios refirred-that the Orange associations
had then origin tit necessity, foi the purpose of
defence, and have never been tggressive
Allison, in lus 'History of Luiope, says, "" there
was this essential difference uetweeii the Orangemen
and the I mteil Inshmen-the combination of the
Oranqcmtn was defensive, induced by necessity, that of
tie Catholics aggtesitie, stimulated by an.bitton lheie
is nothing, however, m Mr Gordon s letter that I so
much regret as the inference he desires to be drawn
from the conduct of Colonel I airman va. refusing to
give up the books with which he had been
confidentially entrusted I believe the infer
euee to be most ui lair, nnd entirely unvvar
ranted In his lefusal he did piecisely

Ordei, and divulDc to the world those tlun0s which
v» ere intended to be kept from all but the initiated,
does mv fnend believe it possible that any amount of
threats or punishment would lead to compliance
lhc question Mr Gordon proposes is-If it was
right and proper to dissolve these associations in
Lngland and Iieland in lSe¡6, why are thev to exist in
l8 el and m this colony My niisuci is that there
are good and suibeient reasons for theu continuance
that there are the same reasons-but in a tenfold
aggravated form-foi the existence of Oiangeism.thut
induced the late able and v cnerable Dr Chalmers, in
the last few y ears of lus lite to believ e in the neces
sitv lor the establislunent ot the Lv angelical Alliance,
whose pnneiples and objects were the same It is
well known that that eminent divine was not an
opprctsoi of Romanists, but that, on the contrary,

and revival of Antichrist, whethei m the form

even that Antichrist which tia eatons to bhake a most
witheimg mildew over the whole ol Christendom
lwo xears later in lfelo (and within two years of the
close ot his honouied and useful life), when he felt
elie nceeseitv for the combination of Prot»stants
without retjUid to forms of Church government, he bj
a pamphlet promoted the establishment ol ' the
Alliance, from w Inch 1 desire to give one or two
exti lets, which I believe as truly and definitely set
forth the principles of Orangeism and the justification
tor their existence as the principles anil objects oí the
""Alliance, with which I bébete it is thoroughly
identified m all its pnneiples lu that pam.«

ÎTelèncc irï rctomniending that they should stand
forth in 'the character first Of a great anti-Popish
association, and secondly of a great homo mission,
believing, as ive do, that to walk together in the field
erf Christian philanthropy is a likely preparation for
thinking together on the questions of Christian faith.""
As serving to mark moro distinctively what he con-
ceived should be the primary object of the institution,
he proposed that it should be ejalled ""The PaoTBfl
tant"" rather than the Evangelical Alliance; and,
after describing the benefit which might arise from
this change of name in the way of warding off the
perplexities which might arise from any attempt to
define the evangelical doctrine so as to obtain for the
definition a universal concurrence, he proceeds thus :
-"" There is another argument in favour of our pro-
posed title. Its single watchword not only describes
very clearly the qualifications of the proposed mem-
bership, but it intimates, with equal clearness, what
the precise work is in which, when brought together
and formed into au association, they are expected to
engage. It is an alliance in defence of Pro-
testantism. Where there is no danger to be warded
off, there might be no reason in pleading for such an
association as we now advocate, or for its title either.
But who can deny the existence of a most imminent
and daily increasing danger r Who eau be ignorant
of the bus}- aggressive proselytism and undermining
policy that are now in active operation, under the
conduct of agents and emissaries from the Church of
Kome? Who can be blind to the evidences now
springing up in vnrious lands, that the old priestcraft
of the Middle Ages is lifting its head again, and
shedding baleful influence over Churches that were
wont to boast of theirs being the foremost place, and
theirs the first-rate services in the cause of the
glorious Reformation ! Whether the Antichrist that
is now reappearing be in the ancient and unmitigateel
torm of Popery, cr in the no less dangerous though
milder form of Puscyism (in these days he would
Write liitualisw), surely there is most urgent call
for vigilance and alarm ; and, should it be made tho
first and most ostensible object of the Alliance to repel
the inrcads of this threatening mischief, ive are con-
fident, if such an undertaking were to give
forth its certain sound, that thousands
¡ind tens of thousands would hasten to
its summons, in the sacred cause of religious freedom,
and Scriptural Christianity, and the rights of private
judgment. It will be miserable indeed, if the hostile
demonstrations from without do not lead us to look
outwardly; or if we shall waste our energies on the
yet premature attempt to settle the account between
the various modifications and distinctions of Pro-
testantism, when the common enemjr is at the door,
and if not met with a systematic and combin'd reiistan<~c,
might bury Protestantiim, throughout all its varieties, in
one common »«in. We tell of a distinct thing to be
dene, and a distinct thing to correspond about, when
we state how desirable it is to ascertain the statistics
of Popery all over the world, and more especially the
statistics of Puseyism and High Churchism (Ritu-
alism)-these great feeders of Popery in our Island ;
anel furthermore, when we state as most fitting objects
for deliberation, what the best methods aro by which
to arrest the progress of the threatening mischief, not
only at home, but in America and the British colonies,
and the continent of Europe, and every other place
where Jesuitism is playing her wiles, and practising
with deadly success her manifold elelusions. Anei
reverting to our own affairs, as well as making an ad
vance from deliberations to doings, what more patent
than the various methods by which our literary and
ecclesiastical and influential men might arouse the Pro
\ testant community of Great Britain, and put our contti
tuincKS on the alert ; and also funds for the niultipli
I eation of scriptural schools, aud outrival our adver-
saries, who at this moment are labouring with all
| their might to obtain possession of the masses by their
linn earied attentions in the houses of the common
| pctiple, and doing whatever in them lies to influence and
Kain 01 cr our heretofore sadly-neglected population.""
These ure what I understand to be the principles and
objects of Ornngeism-and if they are, I say to the
Orangemen-go on and prosper-be true to your
principles-true to your Bible-loyal to your Queen
-obedient to the laws-and brotherly affectioned to
all men of every creed, and you need not fear attacks
from any quarter. It is quite certain that the ranks
of the institution will be increased more by the
slanders of false brethren than Irom any other cause.
I know of nothing which aroused the feeling of quiet
soberminded Protestants so much, as the fact of a man
who calls himself a member of the Church of England
daring in the Legislative Assembly to compare
Orangemen with Fenians.
Believing that I have truly stated the principles of
Orangeism, and the only objects they have in view,
I must say that I never have been able to understand
how it is that loyal subjects of her Majesty-and
above all, men who are sincere Protestants-could
apply such rancorous language and such insulting
epithets as have been applied to those whose only
crime is that they dare to keep in remembrance
and to celebrate those great evento which enabled the
i late accomplished Lord Macaulay to write, "" It is
* because we had a preserving revolution in the seven
i teenth century, that, we have not had a destroying
' revolution in the nineteenth. It is because we had
j freedom in the midst of servitude that we have order
I in the midst of anarchy. Por the authority of law,
for the security of property, for the peace of our
\ streets, for the happiness of our homes, our gratitude
is duo under IIi.m who raises and pulls down nations I
at his pleasure-to the Long Parliament, to the Con
vention, and to William of Orange."" I
I will conclude by simply stating it as my deliberate
conviction^that if I had a desire to become an Orange-
man, there is nothing in Mr. Gordon's letter that
would cause me to pause for an hour, and I predict
that it will lead fifty persons to join for one it will
deter from becoming connected' with the Orange
1 Association.

finished a now dip, an elaborato affair of oonoroto
and stono, into whioh tho poor sheep, aftor being

and it requires a irood deal of powor to drag him

beast is lassoed, and tho wholo unemployed foieo '

ísdraarged by sheer force ft on. tho yard Ino I

threateningly, and o! argos at tho high ftnoo, but

into tho oalf's BUIO By nnd byo, tho stookmou,
who havo boon out Binco morning, return from
their daily round of mustering and drafting, and
the day is finished by a quiet game of onokot,
wherein more goodwill than snnnoo is displayed
Tho ""white-painted homestead, fronting the dam,
is a modol of coolness and oomfort Tho quiet
family life goes on hero undisturbed by the
ohange of seasons and only eohocs of tho busy
work-u-day existonco without reach theso
soolnded walls Tho view from tho veran-
dah, over tho vines and rosea of the
gardon, takes in the whole of the rich grazing
plain, and ondB only with tho jagged edges of the
Warrumbungle Range, of whioh tho central
mountain, Bullaway, towers high above tbo rest
w ith ita sharplv-pomtod peak The mountain is
visible from all parts of tho run, and serves as a
usoful landmark to tho traveller, for ho has only
to direct his atops ton arda it in order to find the
homo station The strangely-shaped mass of
rook is tho first object upon willoh one's
eyes light at sunrieo, whilst at night,
whon the rain clonas hover round
it, threatening to descond on the plain below, it
has an angry forbidding aspect Clustering
ahont aro many minor peaks, silhouetted against
the sky, and taking all sorts of fantastic, shapes
In the recesses of those hills, nlmnst inaccessible,
there are thousands upon thousands of rook
wallabies, beautiful nimble httlo creatures, against

by sentiment, wages otoinal warfate Conse-
quently the marsupials aro trapped and shot by
thousands, but thou* number never scorns to
dimmish
ON THE r_i-NS
Out on the plains, thanks to the splendid season,
tho arasa grows luxuriantly, and the sheep aie in
the best of all possible condition In fact, undor
present circumstances tho run ia rather over than
understocked Though it basan area, in all, of
120,000 acres, there are only about 60,000 shoop
upon it This number, of course, mil be increased
12 000 or 1S,000 by tho lambing, now just begm
mug, but, oven then, if the grass continues
to flourish and the season fulfils its promise,
there will be room for plenty moro stock The
run affords a remarkable instanco of tbo mannor
in which the wholo fuce of the country can bo
changed by tho judicious expenditure of capital
""When tho present propnotor, Mr C Fether-
stonhaugh, took tho place over from Sir Patrick
Jennings 17 years n.ro, tho run was known as a
very dry one, that IB to say, there was little
natural water upon it The result waa that,
during the drought of 1877, Mr Fetherston-
haugh lost 2-1,000 sheep, and, warned by
this severe blow, he set to -work to
improve the carrving capacity of the run Dams
were erected, or tanks sunk in every part of the
property, until to-day there are 34 of these reser-
voirs many of thom of largo size Thus every
one of the SO paddocks into which tho run is
divided is within easy reach of water, whilst, as
an additional precaution, four wells were sunk to a
depth of over 100ft Of lato, however, theso
wells have not been required, and the whims rest
idly, waiting for another long drought to bring
them into use Thus, as long as the feod
holds out, a drought can do but
little injury to the stock, for there
will always be watei available, if not in ono
paddook, then in another This security from
climaho variations has not, however, beon obtained
without heavy ontlay, and the run, up to tho
present, has cost its proprietor, in land and
improvements, £60,000 25,000 acres have beon
ringbarked and tho s""rub kopt from encroaching
on tho grazing land, whilst the threatened inva-
sion of rabbits has been guarded against by a wire
netting fence, which almost completely surrounds
the run
AMMA- PESTS
In this respect tho lessee is well ahead
of the times, or rather the rabbits, for
whilst othcis are talking about having the
distnot proclaimed rabbit-infested, or are clamour-
ing for an extension of lease, Mr Fetherston-
haugh has quietly ahnt the rabbits out, and in a
few years whon the neighbourhood is overrun,
will reap the advantage of his forethougnt There
are other pests, however, whioh cannot bo kept
out by fencing, unless, indeed, the boavons could
be nottod in As we dm e through the paddocks
wo count hero and there the httlo waite lambs
which run by the side of their dirty-looking
mothers The lambing has jUBt commenced, and
soon there will be hundreds of the little
creatures on the plains Out of the
high grass in front of us an eaglehawk
soars aw aj with a dignified air, while aftei him
flutter hastily half a dozen ill-favoured black
crows w hioh at tin» season follow the great bird
of prey like jaekalls "" He has jnst killed a
lamb,"" Buys the squatter, as ho notices the ewo
looking anxiously for her young one Every
eaglehawk it is reckoned, costs the station a lamb
a dav at this season, and thoreiore the bird is
detested and destroyed whenever possib'o Poison
goneially do-s tho work for whon a hawk kills
a lamb he eats only a portion, leaving the re-
mainder for another repast In the meantime,
if the station hands find the lamb, it is poisoned,
and whon the bird returns it is only to his
death
¿. aru-C- SELFCTOH
Down by the Myall Creek, some 10 miles to the
oastward of tho Home station, quite a cluster of
selectors havo made their homes One of this
class I mot standing hy his well bred maro, and
watching a labourer dierging holes and putting up
tho rough pine posts which were intended to sup
port the wiro lonoe It was not the selootor's
business to work, for the arass around him grow
knee-deep, he stood on a splondid plain of grn/ing I
land, and hi» htook would thrive and fatten
without any intervention on his part
The man was bettor dressed than the
average bushman, for he belonged to a
class somewhat above the ordinary stock-rider or
rousaabout Neither had ho anything of tho
homely, hardw orking farmor about him and, in
faot, when taking up his selection, nothing was
further from his thought« than oultivatuior tho
coil He was, in short, a small grazier, a micro-
cosm of tile squatter, working his land in exnotly
tlie samo woy He had made a little monoy as a
drover, and half a do/on years ago found himself
in a position to talto up a 640-aore C P., with its
accompanying 1920 acres O L The land is
exceptional!} good even for this district of rich
pastures, and once having fenoed and stocked the
land, ha had only to leave the rest to nature
The very appearance of tho homestead mdicatod
comfort and prosperity The neat little weather-
board cottage had a pretty flower ""'arden in front,
the outbuildings were numeroua and substantial,
and the oattlo and horses round about showed un-
mistakable signs of good breeding The wonder
is how all this oan bo done on the
small area of 2560 acres without the aid
of cultivation A little dealing in cattle
a little horse-breeding, and an occasional
trip droving is probably the explanation The
selection, during the present exceptionally arood
season, is currjing no less than 2100 and the
owner evidently did not consider himself over-
stocked, tor he positively refused to sell any of
I them, though au offer was made in my presenoo
1 This is tho picture of the fortunato grazing soloc
tor, who had sufficient capital wherewith to make
a fair sturt Even his position, however cannot
bo regarded ns any too secure, for as his ohiel
source of profit is shoep-growing, and as ho has
no orops to fall back on, a few bad seasons, a
constant succession of droughts, avould tost his
endurance to the utmost, and might oven bo
fatal

The annual meeting of the Board and
election of three members in place of Messrs.
F. M. Young, C. C. Nairn, and G. Currey,
who retired under the provisions of the
Town Boards Act, 1891, was held at the
Public Library rooms, Main-road, New
Town, on Saturday afternoon. Mr. W, P.
Brownell had been appointed by the Board
to preside, and at 1 o'clock opened the
meeting, fixing the close of the poll for 6
o'clock. The candidates were the two re-
tiring members, Messrs. Young and Currey,
with Messrs. G. C. Bernard, F. G. Knight,
and J.G. Steele, Mr. J. Jeffrey, though
nominated, having withdrawn from the
contest. Considerable interest was taken
by the electors, and canvassers were at work
for most of the candidates. Mr. Brownell
was assisted by Messrs.1 R. J. Ellis and A.
Strathern as poll oUrks. The result was
made known at 7 p.m. to a considerable
number- of eleotors outside the Library
rooms, as follows :- G. C. Bernard, 198 ;
J. G. Steele, 153 ; F. G. Knight, 152 ; G.
Currey, 118 ; C. C. Nairn, 114 ; Jeffrey,
10 ; informal votes, 7. Mr. Browuell de-
clared Messrs. Bernard, Steele, and Knight
duly elected, all of whom returned thanks.
The Chairman of the Board, Mr. F. W.
Piesse, proposed a vote of thanks to Mr.
Brownell, but the electors (or some of them)
declined to hear him, and the vote was
eventually carried on the motion of another
elector, Mr. Brownell acknowledged the
compliment, and the proceedings closed with
three cheers for the Queen.",The Mercury ,"213,632,613,613,618,616,615,611,613,612,615,611,612,609,615,611,616,612,616,615,617,616,602,613,613,614,613,616,614,612,610,613,614,617,615,614,371",Mon 17 Apr 1893,"3917,3946,3978,4006,4038,4068,4098,4128,4158,4190,4221,4251,4282,4312,4343,4374,4404,4436,4464,4496,4526,4557,4586,4618,4649,4679,4710,4739,4770,4802,4832,4863,4894,4924,4954,4982,5018","2630,2400,2415,2417,2414,2415,2415,2415,2415,2416,2415,2415,2416,2417,2415,2415,2415,2417,2416,2416,2416,2416,2415,2416,2416,2416,2418,2416,2417,2416,2419,2418,2417,2415,2417,2417,2418",13280999,Page 3

From a correspondent wo loam that at the date of the I
Lubcck'8 departure from Tonga everything was quiet and
the prospects of trado wore very good."" Our correspondent
says :
j "".It'seems very likely indepd that a large amount of
copra will be produced this season, as there ""ms been no
hurricane, and the crop of nuts is consequently a larpe one.
In religious matters also there is peace, at all events for the
posent, as both parties aro awailinir tho result of the recent
inquiry conducted by the High Commissioner. There is no
active persecution against the Wesloyans, and tho people
aro ostensibly freo to join any church thoy please. The new
church, which is being erected by the Free Church people in
front of the Rev. Mr. Muult _'s house, is now well odvancod,
and as poon as the timber which is1 expected to arrive by the
Richmond 1» roceived, rapid progress will bo made The
King himself is superintending the erection. Ho is present
every day with tho workmen, and has beon several times
up in the roof assisting them in fixing and tying tho
timbers. This might bo regarded as rather a hazardous
porlormanco for a man of his advanced years, but ho
appears to be still quite halo and stroug, and devoid of all
fear. The Rev. G. Brown and Mr. P. P. Fletcher, the
commissioners appointed by the Wesloyan Church in
Sydnoy to inquire into the state of affairs in Tonga, have
been engaged in thoir work during the past'month, and are
now returning by the Lubeck.^ From all that we cari learn,
they have done their best to' ascoitain the ttue state of
affairs, irrespective of parties. ' What their report will
bo is, of course, not known here, but it is gonerallv
believed that thoy aro m favour of concessions boing
made on both sides, by which the Wesleyun Church
may be again united, and that thoy uro not without hopes
that some plim may bo formulated by which this may be
secured. One good result of the visit of these gentlemen
will certainly be that they will have a better idea of the
actual state of affairs here .'than thoy had before their
uri i val, as they have had the opportunity of testing the
trustworthiness or otherwise of many of* tho loiters and
stories which havo appeared from timo to time in the
colonial newspapers about affairs in Tonga. Thoy have
had frequent interviews with both parties, including tho
Kinir, and have also conversed freely with both chites and
natives. It is hoped that some plan may bo found by
which this quarrel may bo put an end to, as people down
here are hcarlily tired of it all.,
1 "" Mr. Shirley Baker, tho son of the Premier, who was so
severely wounded in the attempt to assassinate his father,
is again attending to his duties, but grave fears are outer- '
tnincd that he will never regain tho uso of tho arm which
was so seriously injured Miss Beatrice Baker, who so
nobly covered hor father with her own body, and so received
the bullets or slugs which wero intended for him, is still
seriously ill ; and though eight months have now elapsed
since tho attack, she is still confined tojier bed.' and owing
to the injury received in her spine is compelled to
remain in ono unvarying position, as she cannot bo moved .
without gi oat danger, and all excitement has'to be care-
fully ganrded against. It is for this reason that sho has
not yet been allowed to seo her brother, who WUB woundod
at the same timo.
*' The new schoonor Toafa ILtameà, built in Auckland for
the King, bus arrived, and loft hero a fow days afterwards
for Nina Foou, with Itov. J. B. Watkin, Mr. Charnier, and
some natives as passengers. TheMuile, from Auckland,'has
siso arrived, having on board Messrs. M'Millán,'M.Ii,A.,
of Sydnoy.nnd Thompson, of the fiim-'of Messrs. M'Arthur
nnd Co. It is generally surmised that those gentlemon in-
tend to make ""somo alterations in the management of the -
affairs of tnat firm in theso islands, but the nature of them
is not yet known.
We have now a mco comfortable hotel in Nukualofa,
called the International Hotol, which is conducted by Mr.
and Mrs, Bentley, into ot.Fiji. This affords a quiet and
pleasant homo to all who, from business or pleasure, may
havo to visit Tonga. , We down here think that if tho ad-
vantages of, a visit to,Tonga during the winter montha in
Sydney wereiinore fully known, we should have a large
influx of visitors, and ""wo aro sanguino enough to believo
that thoy would be pleased and bonofited by their stay, and
would bo auro to rovibit ' our fair island, and also^induce
others to, do the sumo. The voyago can bo mado between
Touga and-Sydney by the Lubeck in about BBven days,
whilst passengers who wuk at tho same time to visit,
or to return via Fiji, can do so by tho boats of the
Union Steamship Company, which connect at Tonga with
tho Lubeck, or thoy can moko the trip from Tonga to New
Zealand, via Samoa and Tahiti, by the s s. ltiuhmond.
We in Tonga often wonder whether the peoplo in Sydney
aro fully awaro of tho immense imptovomont in means of
transit which has been effectod by the appointment of a
first-class bteatnor like the Lubeck to run between Sydnoy,
Samoa, and Tonga. A.few years ago nona of us old'resi-
dents would have ventured to predict such an event as
likely to happen within tho next 50 years, and yet to-day
it is an accomplished fact, and hundreds of poor miserable
sufferers from bronchitis and ' the thousand ills that flesh
is hoir to ' during a New South Wales or Victorian winter
may in a few days exchango the cold winds and variablo
weather of Australia tor balmy breezes and sunny skies in
Tonga. Lot me advise your readers to go down to the
Circular Quay and look at the good ship Lubeok, with her
splendid accommodation for passengers, and if possiblo get

-.-; {
(BY PAKTHBNOPK.) j
After a month of almost unprecedented
dullne«B for the midst of a season, it is very
satisfactory to havo passed a week in which
there has been more than one sooial event of
any magnitude to chronicle. Last Tuesday
there was the "" At home "" at Government
House. That was more thoroughly enjoyed
apparently than any of the other ""*At
homes,"" though why it is a little difficult to
say. Perhaps the guest« after au long a
poriod of dullness felt their sooial appetites
sharpened, and were thereforo moro easily
plcaaed, and more pleasing, but be that aa it
may the ontcrtaimnent was a groat success.
Last Wednesday evening Government
Houso was aga!ti gay, when the Governor
and Lady jersey gave a dinner party.
Cardinal Moran, Very Kev. Dr. O'Haron,
Mr. and Mrs. Edward Knox, Mr. Mrs. and
Miss Laidley, Mr. and Mrs. Carl Sahl, Mr.
and Mrs. Bruco Smith, Mr. and Mrs. W. P.
Manning, Miss Manning, Mrs. Rupert
Clark, Mr, H. Bradshaw, Captain Cholo
mnnilcly, and Mr. Goschen, wore the
guests. It was as much a suoccss as dinner
parties usually aro.
Tho danoo given by Captain Lang and his
officers on board H.M.S. Tauranga last
Wednesday was a particularly nice one. The
trip across tho water was lovely, and the
men-of-war boats left for the ship with great
punctuality. The decoration« wera all that
could be desired, perhaps a little more, and
the dancers not too numerous. Amongst
the guests woro Sir Frederick and Miss F,
Davey, Mr. and Mrs, \V. B. Mitnholl, Mrs.
and Miss Burdekin, Mr. and Mrs. Richard
Terry, Captain Leigh, Lieut, and Mrs.
Forrest, Captain, Mrs,, and Miss Linde
mann, and Lieut. Elton.
, Mrs. RichardTeec«'sliterary""Athome""was
I a groat success. An ordinary "" At home,""
with ita ordiuary conversation, sandwiched
with a littlo music, is not unfrequently a
very dry affair, but a literary "" At home "" Is
an innovation, and as suoh was welcomed
and anticipated rather eagerly. Mrs. Teece
is to be congratulated upon tier tasto in the
matter of inviting her guests, Many of the
ladies whoso names wo connect with the
Woman's Suffraee Movement, and the
Woman's Literary Society were present.
Lady Windeyer, Miss Rose Scott, Miss
Tilley, and Mrs. Teece herself made speeches.
Miss Macdonald, theprinoipal of tho Woman's
Collégo was there, also Mrs. Grantley Fitz
hardinge, Mrs. and Miss Curnow, Mrs.
Maillcr-Kendall.thc Misses Consett Stephen,
Mrs. -Tooth, and the MisseB Montefiore.
Most of the speeches went to provo woman's
capability and right to vote,- and the benefit
that would accruo to a nation in whioh
woman's suffrage had obtained. Miss Tilley
claimed that women have a right to the
suffnigr», not beoauso they aro intellectually
men's equals, or even beoauae thoy are likely
to uso their power beneficially, but because
as human beings who, in submitting
to be governed, had an absolute un
deniablo right to have a voice in the selec-
tion of those who shall govern them. Shs
pointed out that womanhood suffrage must
inevitably bo brought about, but that it was
idle to speculate on whether It« results
would be good or the reverso, and that «ho,
for her part, thought those enthusiasts who
expected such a wonderful amount of good
to accruo from it were doomed to disappoint-
ment. Women would vote sho firmly
believed from the very same motives that
mon now did, either because the candidate
was a man after her own heart, because he
would be of use to her in business, or
because there happened to be a political
crisis, and every voter had been roused up
to stand by his or her party.
There were several other spoeobosr,both
for and against tho movement,""4 and
altogether the meeting was suoh a success
that we are sure to have plenty more of
them.
To turn to a more frivolous topic, leaving
tho Woman's Right question upon the shelf,
there have been an unlimited number of
""»ociáis"" and ""athomes"" within the last
week. Tho first of a series of dances given
by tho Darlinghurst Ladies' Bread and Butter
Club took place in the Debating Club last
week. Mrs. Butler save a delightful
dance to her pupils in the Paddington
Town Hall a few nights ago, and Mr. and
Mrs. McLean, wishing to be original, gove
a nursery ball on tho same night at their
residence. Of course a nursery ball must of
necessity bo a fancy dress one, and it is not
difficult to imagine tbo costumes, Bo-peep
was there, and the Mother Hubbard and
Goose, Jack Horner, and Robin Hood, and
equally of course, Little Buttercup and Jack
and Jill.
The Wilcannia Boating Club plain and
fancy dress ball last Wednesday was one of
the most successful and enjoyable ever held
in tho town. The Ball Committee and M.C.
(Mr. E. O'Donncll) are to bo sincerely con-
gratulated upon tho success of their efforts.
During the evening MeBsrs. Knox and Dick-
son were presented with tho "" Ladies' Bag ""
recently won by them with double skulle.
Reference was made to tho club's pros-
perous condition, and Usures given to prove
it to be among tho first in the colony.
Dancing was kept up until morning and
every ono seemed to regret even then that
their long looked forward to dissipation was
over.
The shipmasters in port propose holding
their annual festivity this year at Leigh
House on the 23rd of next month. Captain
Sutherland is the hon. secrotary, and the
other chief posts of honour are, wo hear,
disposed of.
We have just had a celebration in connec-
tion with tho poet, Shelley, at the School of
Arts. Mr. Barton, the Attorney-General,
occupied the chair, and delivered a Bpeech.
Ile remarked that ho saw in the programme
there were two addresses to be delivered,
one on ""Shelley ; the Poet aBd Philosopher,""
by the Rev. G. Walters; and oño on
"" Shelley ; tho Man and the Roformer,"" by
Mr. A. McLaren, and therefore be, Mr.
Barton, made a very short opening Bpeech
in consideration of the great interest of the
subject before them.
The Rev. Geo. Walters remarked that
Shelley was one of those individuals who
wero slandered and blasphemed by their
own generation but admired and reverenced
by posterity. He was like a child spirit
cast into a world of mad passion, bitter
hatred, cruel persecution. Ho was now
beginning to be recognised as a
Comet, beautiful and flerco,
Who draw tho hoart of this frail universo
Towards his own.
Though harsh voices might even yet croak
of his follies and misdeeds, though like the
foul carrion birds that gathered around the
dead monarch of tho plain, his detraotors, in
forgetfulnosB of their own sins, collected in
unholy haste to tear his reputation to pieces,
still ho lived in a realm too puro and high
for them to reach, Tho influences of pre-
judice and custom, and society and wealth
and social prestige had still to be fought,
Tired with tho noble thoughts so beautifully
expressed by the poot wo can work onward,
and catching tho slow of his enthusiasm re
dedicate ourselves to the services of
humanity, listening to his words full of
passionate feeling of faith and hope
Oh man ! hold theo on in courage ot soul,
Through tbo stormy bhados of thy worldly
way,
And tho billows oí cloud that around theo roll
.Shall sleep ¡n tho light of a wondrous day,

Mr. M'MiXLAN's motion in the Assembly
with respect to the land boards and the
Minister, has raised questions that could not
be Cully debated under a fortnight. The
motion, simply declares that the decisions of
the boards should not be overruled by the
Minister unless corruption or incompetence on
the part of those bodies can be proved, but
the House did not confine itself to that point
on Tuesday; and the debate last night took a
still wider range. The general question as to
the treatment that the pastoral lessees
have received at the hands of the
State was discussed, and if the de-
bate had been on the second reading
of a land bill, it could hardly have been
more discursive. Mr. Garretx's speech was
unfavourably criticised by Mr. Wilson and
Mr. Kelly, who declared that in raising the
rents in certain cases the Minister has done
an injustice to the lessees. Their view was
that the rents as assessed by the local boards
were high enough, and that the Minister,
whether he had tho power or not, ought
not to have increased them. Squatting
under the present Act, it was urged, is
pursued at a disadvantage, and the Minister
should not aggravate tiie difficulties. Some
of Mr. Garrett's points were met by denials
or explanations. He had statpd, for
instance, in proof that the rents were
not unjust, that nearly all the lessees
had paid the amounts required from them.
To this Mr. Wilson made reply that the
lessees had paid because until they bad done
so they could not appeal. Again, Mr.
Garrett told the House on Tuesday night
that the inspections tipon which, the ap-
praisements were founded had been made
when the country was at its worst ; but
according to Mr. Wilson the inspections in
the North-Western district were not com-
menced until several months after the
breaking up of the drought, when the country
was in an unusually flourishing state. Mr.
Kelly . also drew attention to the fact
that the evidence upon which the boards
acted was not reproduced with faithfulness,
so that the Minister decided cases without
really knowing what their merits were. But
no one was able to show that the Minister
had exceeded his powers in reviewing the de-
cisions of the boards, and even Mr. Abbott,
who thoroughly disapproves of the existing
system, was obliged to admit that the
Minister possesses the power which he has
exercised, excepting as regards the conditional
leases.
Mr. Abbott's was the speech, of the even-
ing. He reminded the House that the Land
Act as it stands is a very different thing
fiom the bill as originally framed,
which made piovision for a satisfactory
tribunal. The great objection taken to
the Act as now administered is this'-that
the decisions of the local boards are set
aside by one man, who sits in private and
raises or lowers the rents at pleasure. For
the existence of this system the As-
sembly is itself responsible. As Mr.
Abbott showed, the Land Bill of 1884
when introduced provided for the con-
stitution of a land court, consisting of
the Minister and two assessors, Nchosen by
him fiom a panel of twelve appointed by the
Governor-in-Council for a term of five years.
The intention of the framera of the bill
was that the local land boards should make
the recommendation, and that the «jITíisteb
should lix the rent, not as a Minister, hut as a
court ""transacting its business openly before
the whole world. In other words, Mr. Abbott
said the object of the bill was to get rid of
the individuality of the Minister, and to
cause what had been done in private to be
done openly. But the Assembly deliberately
struck out the words íehiting to the assessors,
and left the whole power in the hands of the
Minister. He was not directed, however, to lix
the rents in piivate, and Mr. Abbott contends
that whoever» presides in the Land Depart-
ment under the piesent Act should sit in pub-
lic when he deuls with the assessments recom-
mended by the boaids, and invite those whose
interests are affected to represent their view
of the case. There seems to be no reason why
the Minister should not do this. Sir. Gar
bett thinks that if he were to sit in public
and listen to statements pro and coil., he
would be "" holding a court"" not constituted by
law, and that, therefore, he would be acting
illegully. Of course he could not open a land
court and take evidence on oath without legal
authoiity, but it is diflicult to see ,what ob-
jection there could be to such a course of
procedure as that suggested by Mr. Abbott.
But whether the Minister were to sit
openly or in private as he does now, his de-
cisions if he sat alone would always be
open to question, for the reasons urged by
Mr. M'MiLlan and those who support the
motion. The exigencies of political life
might at any time place at the head of the
Lands Depaifcment a man who had >ery little
knowledge of the subject, and yet it would
be in his power to say what rent should
be paid for this run and for that. On
the other hand, he might be influenced by
party motives or private prejudices, and
there would be no check upon him in either
case. Under such circumstances even just
decisions would probably be cavilled at, and
from whatever point of view the system is
regarded it cannot be accepted as f-otisfac
tory. If, on the contrary, effeot wera given
to the intention of the f ramers of the Act, and
two assessors who would be chosen for their
aptitude end knowledge of the land were
appointed to sit with the Minister in oW
court there would be some guarantee S
nil sides would be fairly heard and that tía
rents would be fixed upon a satisfac
tory basis. We nave always contended
for the appointment of a tribuna I
such as this; and if the debate *L
Mr. M'Millan's motion led to au amend,
ment of the Land Bill in that direction the
time that the Assembly has devoted to the
subject would have been well spent.
But it cannot be said that the question is
regularly or properly before the Assembly
Mr. M'Milla-v's motion affiims something
which the House has no business to affirm
The Land Act as it stands gives the'
Minister certain powers, which he exeicises m
due course, and if he accepted the direction,
contained in the motion he would bea\oidin<»
his duty, acd virtually setting aside an \°t
of Parliament. What is required is an altera-
tion of the law ; and although such a
motion as this may do well enough,
as a means of eliciting opinion in the House
it ought not to be pressed, unless tho3e who'
support it intend it as a vote of censure «poa
the Government, and are prepaied to take the
responsibility of forming a new Miniitrv
if they should succeed in earning
the resolution. Considering the ¿tata
of public business the Government had gool
reason for asking the House last nio-htto
bring the debate to a close, the more so as the
whole question will probably be reopened
when the amending Land Bill is dealt with.
It is to be regretted that the House should
have insisted upon going on, for a debate con-«
ducted under such circumstances cannot pos-
sibly do any good. i
Whilst it is an undoubted fact that the
interest rate on accumulations in safe invest-
ments is decreasing, we think the Spectator
in an interesting article recently pub
lished by us, takes a pessimibtic view of
the position when, it writes : "" We should
say the hope for the timid investor
never stood more low, and believe that
the prospects of those who save, of escaping
work and living on dividends, are worse than
at any time within this century. They could
get ö per cent, in 1860 wheie they can only
get 4 now, and will very soon only get 31 .
and the difference, about which nobody
writes, means an addition of at least one
fourth to the years spent in work. The world
loses nothing, of course, or rather gains; but
the class which has hitherto been the most
comfortable in the community find»
its comfort decreasing with the rolling
years, and will, if we are right, find
it decrease still more."" We believe that the
course of events is showing improvement
for the class referred to as for others, and
that this may be demonstrated by a few con-
siderations which are overlooked by our con-
temporary.
In the first place it may be said that the
increased purchasing power of money is
ignored. The capitalist who, in 18G0, ob-
tained £50 per annum on every £1000 he
possessed, is no better off than he who now
gets only £40 per annum for a like amount,
Conditions vary in different countiies no
doubt. But, taking the mother country by
way of illustration, we have only to look at
the evidence which leading financial autho
lities furnish to obtain proof of this. In its
commercial review for 1886 the Economist
gives tables, from which we gather that most
of the principal articles of food are very much, »
cheaper thun they were thirty years ago,
Wheat has declined 40 per cent., rice SO per
cent., sugar over GO per cent,, and tea more
t>an SO per cent. A few articles are rather
dearer, including butchers' meat, which is 10
to 15 per cent» higher ; but, geneially, there is
a very great decline in the value of food,
Articles of clothing are also much cheaper,
Wool is down 25 per cent., cotton lo peí
cent., and silk is rather cheaper. The
manufactured article, however, is not lower
in a like degree. The cost of the labour, coal,
and machinery which go to its production
has not fallen in an equal ratio, or at least
h»d not in 1S83, when Mulhall in his
"" History of Prices "" gave the real fall
in the value of textile manufactures in
83 years as 11 per cent. Any changé
since that time, however, has been in the
direction of cheaper production. The value of
articles which go to house-furnishing art
generally much cheaper. Timber is 15 per
cent, lower, iron and lead over 40 per cent,
coal from 10 to 15. per cent. House rent was
higher in the cities, but recently there ha«
been a great fall ; and it may be ques-
tioned whether this item would now
cost much more than it did thirty
years back. In the absence of complete data
we are not able to give an exact comparison
of the cost of living now and at that time ;
but men in the prime of life who recall tb»
circumstances of the past generation would
probably say that prices all round have
fallen greatly, and that £40 would
now purchase as much as £50 would pur-
chase in 1800. Whatever the future may
do, the experience of the past three decades
does not warrant the conclusion that people
who have had a reduced income from their
investments have necessarily had a diminu-
tion of the means of comfort. Relatively
thoir position may not compaie so favourably
with that of others. But taken all round,
the position for the investor is not worse. It
is with many rea-lly better. As a matter oí
fact, a man who had a fixed investment
at 4 per cent, in Government securities -0
years ago need not sutler by the reduction,
for the increase in the value of his stock
enables him to resell at a profit, and get a
larger amount of stock of a smaller denomi-
nation, which will give him an equal income ;
and with that, as we have shown, an increase
of the means of comfort. But it will be saia
that this only applies to the man who has
money. How will those who are starting in
life be affected by the diminishing rate o£
interest on investment ? ' .
And this brings us to another eesentiai
feature which, it seems to us, has been over
looked'by the Spectator. Contempomneousiy
with a reduction of the hours of labour,
which of itself implies greater comfort, there
has been a marked increase in wages. »
hall says that in 1S83 wages had risen 4U
per cent, from 1851-60. Possibly there has
since been a slight reduction; but tne»
can be no doubt that within the pan
generation wages have gone up fully <W Pe*
cent, 'ihus any man now setting oui
in life has a fairer prospect of making o pro-
vision for infirmity and old age than prated
itself in 1860. The « rolling years have
told in his favour-not to his disadvantage^

The inquiry by the Marine Board into the circumstances
attending the collision between the Helen Nicoll and the
Keilawarra was continued yesterday.
H. Pegg, master of the Australian, in reply to Mr.
Rogers, said that he remembered himself and other persons,
including Mr. M'George, chief officer of the Keilawarra,
being on the bridge of that vessel ; in conversation regarding
the accident took place, and M'George detailed what had
taken place on board the Keilawarra as to his seeing some-
thing ahead, and the captain giving orders to port the
helm.
Captain Broomfield; Would you consider it prudent for
an officer in charge of a deck to proceed at full speed when
he had a green light of another vessel ahead or slightly on
his starboard bow, when his smoke at times obscured the
light of the approaching vessel, and was likely to obscure
his own.
Witness : It would depend upon how far the light was
from him; if it was five miles he would go on; if it was
one mile he would call the captain.
To Mr. Rogers: He had known Captain Fraser several
years; that officer had the reputation of being shrewd,
steady, careful, and sober.
John Miller, engineer, in answer to Mr. Rogers, said
he had had a good deal of conversation with Mr. M'George ;
that officer said that if the Keilawarra had kept on her
course the accident would not have occurred ; he had
known Mr. M'George for over eight years ; M'George
had been in business in Melbourne.
Mr. Wise objected that this had nothing to do with the
case ; but, if it were desired, Mr. M'George would give the
whole history of his life.
The President took a similar view, and added that Mr.
M'George must have proved himsell qualified, or he would
not have obtained his certificate.
Robert Affleck, chief officer of the Australian, also re-
membered Mr. M'George describing on board that vessel
what had occurred between the captain of the Keilawarra
and himself just prior to the collision.
John See, the owner of the Helen Nicoll, said he had
known Captain Fraser a great many years ; he had known
him before he was in their employ, in vessels trading
between Shoalhaven, Melbourne, and Sydney, with grain ;
Captain Fraser had been in their employ four or five years
as chief officer or captain ; he had never heard any com-
plaints regarding him ; what he had heard was solely in his
favour; he had himself been served before the present
inquiry with a writ from Howard Smith and Sons for
damages in connection with the collision.
Mr. Knowles, second officer of the Helen Nicoll, was re-
called, and repeated his explanation with regard to the
bearing of the Keilawarra lights when he first saw them.
In reply to Mr. Wise, he said he was sure highlights were
in position 10 minutes before the collision.
Mr. Wise desired that a Mr. Maher, a passenger on board
the Helen Nicoll, should be called.
Mr. Rogers said that Mr. Maher had returned by the
Australian to Yamba. They had received a telegram from
him, offering to come to Sydney if his travelling expenses
were paid and be was allowed £2 a day.
Mr. See said that he was prepared to pay Mr. Maher
what he desired.
Captain Broomfield said that the board would summon
Mr. Maher to attend on Monday morning, as tho case was
one of the most important that ever occurred in Australia,
and the Booid wero exceedingly anxious to have ail possible
evidence in connection with it.
Mr. See «aid that he was extremely desirous on his part
to assist in making the investigation as complete as possible.
He had received from Grafton, from a gentleman named
Baker, a telegram to tho effect that an important statement
from a passenger was going to appear in one of the Sydney
evening papers recm-ding the collision. He telegraphed to
Mr. Baker to know if the passenger would con-
to Sydney if he wanted him to do so. Ho also
received a telegram from his brother who was on
his way to Ynmba to see Mr. Maher, who was a storekeeper
thero, and he sent a telegram himself to Mr. Maher to
know if ho would como to Sydney, and to this ho rccoived
the reply referred to bv Mr. Rogéis.
Mr. wise said thai he desired .to obtain a list of the
names of the crew and passengers of the Helen Nicoll at I
the time of. the accident. I
Mr. Seo said he did not object. Tho crew were »till in
his employ, and ho was very desirous of giving the board
all information in his power.
Mr. Wise said they wanted the attendance of one man in
particular.
Mr. See aBked what tho name of the man was. '
Mr. Wise replied that he did not know.
Mr. Rogers said that if his learned friend went on board
the Helon Nicoll at 3 or 4 o'clock, tho crow could bo
mustered for him on the quàrtor-deck at that hour.
Mr. WI'BO said that would aiiBwor his purpose.
Mr. Rogers said that every one in Mr. See's employ
might be inspected by Messrs. Howard Smith or their
detectives.
Mr. Wise said that his side had been led to understand
that there was one man who could give the Board important
information, end if the crew were mustered the person who
had led them to this understanding might identify him.
Mr. Rogers said that if reasonable time wero given him
ho would undertake to have the crew anywhere that was
desired.
Nelson, the lookout-man on board the Keilawarra, was
recalled. He said bo went on the bridge to look out, and
did not go on the forecastle at all ; tho man he relieved had
been also on tho bridge. i
Captain Bloomfield suid that it was understood then that
tho remainder of tho crow of the Helen Nicoll would be
pie-cnt at hulf-pnst 9 o'clook on Monday,
The inquiry was adjourned until 10 o'clock on Monday.
Tho Melbourne Herald say B :-.' The many friend» of the
Rev. E. H. Du Bois will extremely regret to hear that his
eldest BOU was 'an officer on the ill-fated ship Keilawarra
and was not nniong the saved. "" Tho rev. gentleman ia well
known in the city and in Maryborough as an active'and
senlouB clergyman, and has secured a very large circle of
friends, who will be grieved to hear of the untimely death
of his «on. who waa a general favourite with both officers
and men with whom he had sailed. What makes the affair
more snd is that this trip was to have been the last for

Tho third of tho Mines of winter lectures arranged by
tho management of the Y. M. C A. was delivered last
evening in the largo ball of the Association, and in the
presence of a large audience, by tho Rev. Dr. Itoscbv,
MA. of Marrickville, who took aa his subject,
""God'« Wonderful World-Some 1 bought« on the
btudy of Nature "" Tho doctor laid down that science
in general term« was tho knowledgo of God, of «ature,
and of man. Theology, or tho knowledgo of God,
stood at the vory head of and far abo\o all
other departments of learning, and next to
tbeologv carno the sciences that group thomselvcs
round God's noblest work-man, aud in the third
rank stood physical and natural science No science,
othor than that of theology, was more fruitful in sue
gestion than astronomy, for it illustrated «oma of the
largest question« concerning God and man. The
theory of the linn erne was largely built up by observed
fact« and phenomena of nature, and while the study of
thing« natural of necessity took plsce beneath the study
of things divine, yet nature could claim, and the claim
might well bo allowed, to live under the same roof aa
things divine in the relation of handmaid. One could
not fail to ponder deeply over the eight of what
belonged to the far distant past. Fossils, for instance,
belonging to the carboniferous age, or when Australia
formed part of the bed of the Pacific Ocean, made one
wonder now many million« of year« had paused bv einco
thia continent was formed. One of the most interest-
ing geological places in the colonies waa Ballarat, where
«rold-mimng bad passed through three snccsaaive stages.
First there was the alluvial stage, then the deep lead,
and thirdly, tho deep quartz-reef mining ia the
Silurian rock. When the shaft waa aunk to
tho bed rock and the leads followed. e\ crj thing
ecoinod to be in a maze, but when mining
surveyor« put all the lend« togothcr, and plotted then»
on maps, then it waa seen that all the deep lead« con-
stituted ono great mor system, and on the banka of
these rivers were shrubs and trees and fruits, all
fossilised The plant life, as represented by fossil«,
differed from the plant life of the present ago, but yet
it was marked by features which enabled ono to trace
tbo charactcnetica of our Auabalian flora in the fossi
lisod vegetation Overlying the plant-kxarmg beda
were immense «beeta of lava or bluestone, representing
«ucceasivovoicaniooutbursts, ex tending over a great «pace
of timo and an enormous aroa of country. And m con-
nection with volcanic outburst«, it would bo remem-
bered that about 20 miles off the coast, from Cape
Howe to Newcastle, the bod of the eea dropped to a
great depth in some places as much as 12,000ft 1 his
sudden drop was caused by a vast rent in tho tilioceno
formation, and similar cause«, bringing tho sea into tho
dopiessed land, gavo Sydney its beautiful harbour
In the study of the physical and natural sciences
nno could not fall to be mten-sted and charmed
Mudies such as these led to the awakening of
curiosity, closely allied to which was tho sense of tho
mysterious, and these were raost potent forces.
Ihey led to the gratification of the sense of the beauti-
ful-a wondrous incentive to research Tho charm
about tho different constellations, for instance, lay in
their appeal to the sense of the beautiful, and so with
batanv-at once the puzzle and admiration of all
students Again, tho principle of recognition, in other
words the ploasuro derived from meeting that, perchanco
under now forans, which we formerly knew, and the
thought of an all-embracing unity arose out of
tho study of natural aud physical scionco,
and absorbed the mind with a strange interest. Ihe
very end of philosophy was tho récognition of unity
As to the practical value ef «cionlilio study, ono could
not deprécalo too strongly tho making of science tbo mere
handmaid of wealth The day was coming whon
knowledge would bo truly usod, aa being a divino trust
for the world's benefit. If a man pursued learning
only for the purpose of afterwards filling his pocket,
hi« learning waa a degradation. A lad beean
by making experimenta with his mother's kettle, and
the result wa« that tho world became possessed of a
power which ought long «ince to have reduced tho boura
of labour from 10 to 8, and from 8 to 6, and at the
same time increased the comfort of living tenfold
Benjamin I ranklln became a boy again, and amused
peoplo by flying his kite, but the electric kite girdled
the world with the electrio cable. Sir James Simpson
began bv making compound« of alcohol and other, and
the result waa found in the fact that the mare terrible
operations of snrgery may now be rendered pedaleas,
and some which were once impossible are now
easy. Scientific research, after «time, would supply
a recreation not to bo obtained from books, it would
supply ? recreation intellectually nobler than the
bowling green or cricket field, though these pursuits
were undoubtedly good, and would render more and
more distasteful the dissipation» of the casino, the
skating rink, and the publicbouso. There was hardly
anything which could inculcate a greater modesty and
love of truth than science There the student had to
be willing to learn by trial and by error, and to keep
ear and eye open. That was the principle of
all true science, and that Christ told the
world, was the principle of the kingdom of
God. Again, aa stepping-stones to higher things, aa
tonding to guard against provincialism of thought, the
study of eoience had a verv great valne, and, lastly,
true science novar presumed to deny the existence of
things divine.

-was passed:-""That this meeting views with alarm I
the apparent disposition of the Legislature of not
making the contingent rights of a further term of five
year*'lease absolute, wherebv the pastoral lessees could
and would at once commence to improve their holdings,
principally by the clearing of pine sorub, whioh during
the past five years has made immense growth and
<which must bo cloared before the rabbits which
, are fast appearing can be dealt with ; it is further the
. opinion of this meeting that there IB plenty of land for
settlement for the next 10 years, especially if all the
reserves on the resumed areas wera cannetlad ; and to
withhold the promised lease would be a great injustice,
.nd quite contrary to the expressed opinion of the
Minister for Lands in his speech at Maitland in Sep-

tnat the lino would open up a large quantity of

NOUMEA, SEIT. 16.
A rema--bio trial, and one of interest to
Australian readers, has just been concluded at the
Supreme Court It will be remembered that so
far back as 1883 two (schooners, named respectively
the Ambroua and Idaho, commanded by Cap-
tains BrmultandDuniols, were trading between
Noumea and tho New Hobrides Tho rumours
theo current connected with these and other
traders of the day were of a sensational charac-
ter lu Juno of tbo samo year Daniels, Brmult,
with other persons, woro charged with
kidnappai g, burning «liages, io After
a len/thy trial all were acquitted excepting
Brmult, who failed to put m an appearance, and
m default ho was found guilty and sentenced to
five years' p°nal servitudo An attempt was sub-
sequently made by tho authorities to bring him to
justice from the New Hebrides, where he has
since resided they had not tho power to
enforce the judgment there Strange as it may
appear, Brmult a fow weeks since returned to
Nuumea and immediately surrendered himself to
tho police, at tho samo timo appealing against tho
sentence imposed upon him Tho appeal was
granted, and tho cane ro-opened on tho ""th in-
stant, before a jury and threo Judges The only
evidenoa tendered was that of the acoused
himself, who upon examination by the presiding
Judge, denied the whola of tho charges made
against him Evidence of choraoter wa« not
oven produjod, tho Court apparently having been
satisfied that he had borne a good ono for several
voars past After a short deliberation, a verdict
of ""Not guilty"" was returned, and tho accused
was discharged Great interest was taken by all
closseu in the result of this trial, for Briault at
the moment is well known by all New Caledonian
and Australian ti adera doing business at the
Islands An important matter waa brought to
light during the inquiry, »nd conclusively proved,
that notwithstanding tho Now Hebrides was hold
under tho "" treaty,"" yet the law of extradition
waa not m force there, i e , so far us the French
nation was concerned These remarks, however,
do not apply to British intorests held in the same
direction, for the High Commission-' has the
neoeesary power to enforco judgments of every
dosenption
_ho ofhcml Custom-house loturna havo just
been declared Morohandiao to tho valuo of
£2a2,4Ü7 sterling has been imported into the
colony since tho 1st Tanuary The total value of
foroisu (Neu South Wales) goods reomved during
tho month of August amounted to £15,283, and
during the same period French importations
totalled £14,025, the latter consisting chiefly of
wines £4722, buttei £4dJ, rice -flfil), _c , _o Tho
anomaly of the new duties imposed is exemplified
by tho fact that although tho ta rift on foreign
(Sydney) lard is almost prohibitory, vot the only
parcels to hand during tbo month, amounting to
£299, arrived from places outsido of Franco The
quantity produced in tho colony is almost ml, yet
the consumption of this nrticlo is largo, henoe tho
absurdity of the tariff, and tho complaints whioh
are daily boing mado against it by tho community
The Government aro calling for tenders, return-
able on the 5th proximo, for tho supply of 1000
tons Non castlo and 2000 tons Southern coal, also
for sugar, tea, rnaizo, ¿lo The above are
embraced in tho ordinary yearly contracts, which
supplies aro usually drawn from Now South
Wulcs
Treasury drafts to the valuo of £16,000, payable
in Paris, w«io offered by the Government to the
merchants on the 12th instant The>ro was a good
demand for them, tho wholo being disposed of at a
promium of about 1 per cent The ruling rate of
exchange upon Sydney is J per cent
Wo havo had a continuance of fine weather,
hence a slight improvement is perceptiblo in busi-
ness circles Tho Tanais and Ville de Ciotat are
both discharging large cargoes, and as many of
tho lines aro scarce thoy will go into immediate
consumption
It is to bo regretted that the steamers of the
A U S N Company do not visit Noumea on their
rotura trip from Fiji Great inconvonienco is ex-
perienced by commercial peoplo doing business
-nth Sydney holmes, for it often occurs that we
havo no regnlnr opportunity of forv, arding Aus-
tralian letters for a period of nearly threo weeks,
unless sent via Tiji, v,luch means about 15 days
from here
Iho large quantity of merchandise regularly
drawn from Sydney should bo sufficient induce- I
mont for tho Government there to subsidise
British boats such as the AUSN Company's to
run bctv ecu tina plnco and tho udandu Tt is
certain that if steps uro not soon taken in
tho manner indicated most of tho trade will
go over to Victoria Already the merchants in
that cjuarter are anxious to have a share, and, in
ondcivourmg to obtain tho object m view, aro
