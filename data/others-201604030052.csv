Sm,-Havingbeen present at two ef the above concerts,
and viewing with great pleasure Mr. Gassner's great
exertions in tbe cause of charity, I think that it would
not be out place if the patrons and officers of those
institutions which have received help from the above
source, would tender a complimentary return to Mr.
Gaesner and the members of the band. What I would
venture to suggest is that Mr. G. be asked to prepare
a programme and give a concert, the proceeds of
which to be devoted, either in purchasing a testi-
monial, orto be given in some shape or other to Mr.
G. and his brother musicians.
Hoping this will bring the matter under the notice

COOK V. 11Y11NEÍ, AND ANOTHEK.
Tho trial of this case, which had already lasted two
days, was resumed and concluded.
It was on action bj- Simon Cook, a farmer of Illawarra,
against James Bj-mcs and William Byrnes, proprietors of
tho Mount Pleasant Colliery, to recover damages for the
pollution of a creek or small stream of fresh water which
ran through tho plaintiff's land, by coal from tho defend-
ants' worts. Tho plaintiff'B declaration put tho case in
two ways, first, that the creek had been wilfully polluted
by tho casting of coal therein ; secondly, that tho damiegti
had been the result of ncgltgenco. Tho defendants had
pleaded-first, a general doninl that thej- had dono any
injury to tho plaintiff ; secondly, that whatever injury had
been inflicted lind been the unavoid.iblo result of what thoy
had done in the lawful conduct of their businoss as coal
lumera.
Sir William Manning, Q.C., Mr. Darloy, and Mr. Salo-
mons, instructed by Mr. Maguire, appeared for the plaintiff;
and Mr.,Butlor, instructed by Messrs. Allen, Bowden, and
Allen, for the defendants.
Tho plaintiff was the lessee of Spring G rovo, a farm of
fifty acres, at Fairy Meadow, Wollongong district,
in the vicinity pf the Mount Pleasant Colliery. His
case was that a small stream of water which ran through
his and other lands in that neighbourhood had been ren-
dered unfit for uso bj- tho deposit of n largo quantity of
slocOc coal from the collierj' in question, ana that his farm
had boen otherwise injured from the samo cause. Tho
defendants' caso was that there had been no such injury,
and that although the creek might have boon partially fillod
up by slack coal, this had not been the result of any care
lossnoss on tho part of tho emploj-ccs at the colliery, but of
n land slip, the result of a flood, for which tho defendants
were not responsible. The evidenco was very voluminous,
and in'many respects very conflicting. Tho amount really
in question was a small one, but tho object of tho contest
was rather, it would appear, to determine tho genorol ques-
tion whether or not tho proprietors of cool mines in that
district were to be held responsible for damages of this cha-
racter. According to the plaintiff and his witnesses the
creek had clearly been damaged by the presence of a
quantity of slack coal which hod como down from an
immense henp noar the mouth of the mine-a result bl ought
about by the carelessness of the minors in allowing bo vast
an accumulation at such a place. Tho supply of water from
this creek had previously been regular ana abundant. Tho
water, although a littlo hard for washing purposes, hail
been excellent for every other kind of domestic use, but
since the conl had come down it had been quito useloss.
Tho waterholes had boen completely filled up, so that the
constancy of tho supplj- of water was to it great extent put
an end to, and such as was still to bo had was very bad.
The flood, too, bad carried tho slack coal over some of tho
cultivated land, and hod destroj-cd or damaged tho crops.
Cook had about forty head of cattle which had boen accus-
tomed to drink at this stream, but which could
now scarcely use ii. He had boon compelled
therefore to sink a well. Ho had offered to toke £20
in full compensation for these injuries, and for this sum to
clear out the bed of tho creek himself, but tho defendants
had refused lo give him that amount and had offered only
£10. According to tho defendant«' wltnosses the water of
this creek, which had always been a littlo brackish,.had
been in no way injured by tie influx of slack coal, which
was far less than had been represented, and was occasioned
solely by a landslip during a flood which hod brought down
at the samo time a largo quantity of soil. The spread of
slack coal over tho land to a small extent had rather a
tendency to increaso its productiveness than otherwise, and
tho catUo had in no way suffered. The^offer of £10 had
been tendered, it was sworn, without prejudico-that is to
say without admitting any liability-and only in tho hope
by dealing liberally with tho plaintiff to save all trouble and
expense. Samples of tho water from . this
creek were exhibited in Court, whioh sample«
presented a very uninviting appearance. It was contended
tint they had not been fairly token, but that the water must
havo been btorcd up, but this was denied. Some of this water
was analysed by Mr. Watt, from whose evidence it would
appear that its"" foulness aid not in all probability result
from tho presence of coal, but from that of organic matter.
It further appeared that watcrcrcsscs wore growing plen-
tifully in the creek, and that decomposed vegetable matter
might in dry weather help to make the water bad. Tho
water of the creek, according to Mr. Watt, was naturally
brackish, and tho slack coal from this'mino when settled
(as it. would, settle) ,at. tho bottom of theiBtreain when
' 'net flowing rapidly- would'« not pollute it as alleged.
There was nirtfccr evidence that a stream of water coming
.ut of the same seam of coal was quite pure, and was con-
stantly used for domestic purposes. Seme of the coal was
broken up in Court and placed in tumblers ef water, upon
which it left a slight scum, although without otherwiso
rendering the water apparently impure. The impurity, J
however, va« most positively «vom to by the plaintiff'« *
**""?""-~-i _.
.witnosBcs. Somo evidence was gone into on the part of tho
I ?'_.nti(T lo show that tho lond-slip, if it did canso tho dam-
age (which was denied), lind been the result of some mis-
management of tho excavation. This was mot by direct
contradiction on tho(pnrt of tho defendants. Tho ovidenco
was directly contradictory na to the quantity of slack coal
in tbo heap nenr the colliery, and in nearly ovcry other im-
portant particular, even ¡is to tho local features of tho
gi omul.
His IIokoh directed the jury that the plain ques-
tion for their deteniiiuation was whothor or not tho
plaintiff hnd mndo ont any claim to damages for
injurj"" sustained by him through any want oi duo core on
tho p'nrt of tho defendants' employes. Evory man had a
right to work n coal mine, but ho was bound so to monago
it as that his neighbours should not bo injured. Against
lend slips nud floods no amount of caro could guarel ; but
tho miners wero bound to exctciso duo caro and forethought
so ns when buch accidents took placo their neighbours
might bo «s little injured as possiblo by any escapo from tho
minc.

BEAR. IN MIND,
when disease undermines the health, and the physical
system has become prostrated, a stimulant that will not only
strengthen, but remove the c*use, should be immediately resorted
to. Mental distress is also a fruitful source of the break'ing down
of the constitution, and the ravages of this enemy to health are
truly alarming. For all such maladies,
HOSTETTER'S STOMACH BITTERS
have been found unsurpassed. By acting directly upon the
digestive organs, they remove the heavy, disagreeable fcelinj
atter eating, so often complained of by persons of a delicate tem-
perament. As soon as digestion is restored, the patient finds hil
strength increasing, and his general health improved.
Thousands of persons certify that it may be relied on in all
cases of weakness or nervous debility attendant upon sedentary
habits. The generality of Bitters are so disagreeablo to the taste
that they are objectionable to a weak stomach. This is not the
case with Hostetter's Bitters, whioh will be found mild, and
extremely pleasant. Balsamic barks, plants, and roots contribute
their restorative juices to render it soothing and strenc-thening.
Its basis is the only pure stimulant which has over been produced,
containing no fusil oil, or any other deleterious element. The
most careful and skilful chemists have analysed the bitters, and
pronounce them harmless. This is scientific testimony ; hut the
testimony of the hundreds of thousands who have experienced the
preventive and curative effects of the GREAT VEGETABLE
TONIC and ALTERATIVE of modern times is still moro con-
clusive. In Fever and Ague. Dyspepsia, Billiousness, Nervous
Complaints, Chronic Complaints, and general debility, it Is as
nearly infallible as anything in this fallible world can be.

NOTES ON PASSING EVENTS.
[KItOM OUU OVWX COWIES I-ONDKNT.)
AUOKT.AXJ), 20th January.
Tin; news from lho East Coast is hy no means
so good Ihis last week. At Opotiki, there is a
return of a stale of filings which is very far from
pleasant in the recommencement of hostilities
by (he natives in the line of murdering any
European or loyal native they can catch. All
along they were of course ripe for this, if the
opportunity had been considered favourable, and
the fact that for a considerable time nothing of
the sort was tried went to show that they were
deterred by fear from the course. They have,
it appears, entered upon it again, and this, more
than anything of more decided want of success
to our troops or loss to our men, is the real bad-
ness of the news.
The Auckland papers are a little too much
affected hy it, I think, and seem to lay stress
upon it as if it involved the loss of prestige, and
the undoing of work supposed to be done
already; but 'there is no good ground for sup-
posing that any change at all affecting the
ultimate position of the campaign has taken
place.
Colonel Lyon, who commands at Opotiki,
has, I believe, already taken measures to
repress the forward movement of the rebels,
and a short time will, 1 have no doubt, see
them driven back once more to their fastnesses
where they were to have been attacked some
weeks ago-a course which, if taken, would, no
doubt, have put a stop to the present evils.
Although a good many ambushes have been
set by the rebels, we only know of one victim
having been secured-a Maori of the native
contingent, named Johnson, who was toma-
hawked and brutally hacked to pieces. There
are more than suspicions entertained regarding
the position of many of the natives professedly ,
friendly in the district. No doubt, many arc
traitors, but that is not so remarkable as the
readiness with which we seem always to trust
these people again.
Lower down the coast the last stronghold of
one section of the natives seems to have fallen
to our attack with but trifling loss ; and we may
now consider that, with the exception of the
force at Opotiki, which is a conglomerate of a
good many sections of rebels,-there is now no
fear of a formidable resistance being offered to
our aims on the East Coast. Of course, it is true
that these people arc very easily moved from
place to place, and a little vigour displayed at
Opotiki rntiy soon cause the re-appearance of
ícbcls at Turanga-mii or at Waiapu. This, in
fact, is a main difficulty of our position, and one
not easy to provide against but by constant care
and watchfulness.
On the ""West Coast, at ""Wanganui, it is grati-
fying to find that something vigorous is at last
being done. The operations of General Chute
have not been characterised by any startling
display of military science or of original genius,
but they have been vigorous and well-timed,
and as such have produced better effects than
many more correctly planned operations would
hove done.
The loss of another field officer in Colonel
Hassard, of the 57th, is a great pity, as the
officers hare been very heavy sufferers already
in comparison with the men in this war. How-
ever, the moral effect on the natives of finding
Ile soldiers able to storm pas off-hand and
follow them boldly into the bush will be excel-
lent indeed. To the colonist, too, it is no small
gratification to find that the troops are to have
tile chance before they go to remove the re-
proach which was made against them of being
afiaid of the bush and of native forts. It is no
pleasant position for people of British race at
any time to hear sims cast upon the good name
of the British aimy, of which they arc proud
almost by instinct. A little beating will be
enough for the AVaneanui natives, for they arc
a chicken-hearted race, too cruel to be really
brave, and so esteemed even by their own
people.
1 hope General Chute may see their submis-
sion complete before the troops are all with-
drawn from the colony.
In my account of my experiences of the
northern part of this island (which is the result
of a careful personal inquiry into the facts), your
readers will have learned most of the local facts
of interest al present.
The discovery of a fine vein* of copper at the
lower Thames, in the neighbourhood of the
place where gold has been found in payable
quantities, but inaccessible, owing to native
jealousy, is a fact of some importance.
Copper has been known to exist for some
time in the neighbourhood, and the
proprietor (native) of the land is quite willing
to have it worked. It is said that there is a
good deal of the silver with the copper, which
will of course enhance the importance of the
discovery, if correct.
I am informed that a cominmy, with a capital
of £20,000, is in course of formation to work
the New Zealand flax on the plan discovered by
Mr. Purchas, some of which was in the Sydney
maiket previous to the Avar, and commanded
excellent prices. The present effort promises
well, as some of the best names in Auckland are
concerned.
AUCKLAND, 2'Jlh January.
To-day is the twenty-seventh Anniversary of
the founding of this colony, and all Auckland is
holiday-making in consequence. The weather
seems not to have proved particularly favour
i able to the regatta, which is our way of holding
high festival here on this occasion each year,
I and the absence of the old Maori element to a
great extent from the scene lakes much from
the romance of the affair. Formerly
it was the Maori festival j.ar excellence,
but for the last two years the natives
have not been on sufficiently cordial terms,
excepting to the North-and the Northern
natives never did much in canoe-racing-to come
in any considerable numbers to the regatta.
Were the Northern tribes removed or unfriendly
we should soon be much in the position of the
Australian cities, where an aboriginal native is a
comparatively rare sight.
The position of matters on the West Coast is
veiy greatly improved by the operations ""of the
troops under General Chute. In a former
letter I gave some details of his earlier
operations in taking the pas at Manu
taki and Manapawa, where Colonel Has
sard, of the 57th, was unfortunately mor-
tally] wounded. These successful operations
were, however, only preliminary to his larger
scheme, which he has now, in great measure,
accomplished. That was to penetrate from
Wanganui to Taranaki by an inland route, and
to take all the fortifications, and destroy all the
houses and plantations he could find on the
way. Starting with about 750 men in all, of
whom about 500 were her Majesty's troops,
and 250 colonial forces, either natives or Forest
Bangers, he forced his way through serious
difficulties of all sorts, the chief of which was.
the want of food, which was moro than once
very seriously felt, to the extent of obliging the
troops to eat horse-flesh, as tho commissariat
J»
fe ""*- -*
could.not keep up with them. On the march
about ten days seem to have been consumed'
and it is stated that in the various fights that
occurred on the route not less than 150 natives
were killed. Every fortified place was assaulted
and taken by storm, on the principle established
by the colonial forces on the East Coast, and in
all cases the defenders of the pas seem to have
been panic struck at the apparition of soldiers
actually rushing a pa before a single shot had
been fired at it from the traditional great guns.
General Chute had reached New Plymouth at
our latest dates, and had been received with the
greatest possible enthusiasm, which displayed
itself in the form ol triumphal arches and ad-
dresses.
The General's work, however, is not yet done
by any means. This march indeed is but the
first blow, which must be followed up with
others in rapid succession, unless it is to be
forgotten. He is quite aware of this happily,
and is about to recommence his march back
again, only taking the coast line instead of the
inland route.
At Warca, near the Patia Uiver, and on the
wonderfully fertile plateau that stretche3 away
southwards from the base of Mount Egmont,
there is reason to believe that the natives will
be found in very considerable force, and with
formidable works of defence. The country is
difficult, owing to the heavy scrub of manuka
and flax which occupies most of the district
and the natives are so fully competent to take'
advantage of this that it may safely be said
that the heaviest part of the work is yet to
come.
A continuance of the same fearless tactics
will, however, in the opinion of every compe-
tent judge, lead to the complete and early
success of the operations at Warca as elsewhere,
and loo much credit can scarcely be given to'
General Chute for the ready and able way in
which he lias adopted and applied to regular
military practice the lessons to be learnt from
the experience of the colonial forces.
The native contingent on the East Coast has
been gaining fresh laurels, and the rebels we
may hope have been gaining new experiences
within the last few days. The rebels who were
defeated so often by the combined native and
colonial forces under Major Frazer, retreated on
the difficult country at the head of the river '
Wairoa, where in the very inaccessible district
round the Waikarcmoana Lake, where the river
takes its rise, they considered themselves safe
from molestation. Such was not the view of
either Major Frazer or the friendly chiefs who
followed them up with about 400 fighting-men.
On the 11th and 12th days of this month a
severe scries of skirmishes were fought close to
the banks of this large and romantic lake
where the rebels had erected a pa of some
strength. The struggle seems to have been
severe, and the arts of the defending party were
so clever that it seems hard that they
should have proved so ineffectual. On the
second day the victory of our men was so well
established that the rebels, having lost their pa,
took to their canoes, and favoured by the fine
weather-in windy weather the lake is too
stormy for ennocs-made their escape, leaving
forty-one dead bodies behind them. Many, no
doubt, were wounded in the affair on their side,
as thirteen were on ours. The greatest chief of
the Wairoa was left dead by the rebels, as well
as five or six men of leading rank. Amongst
the loyal dead (twelve) there were no men of
note ; but old lhaka, a great chief and warrior,
who was, in fact, commander-in-chief, was
rather badly wounded in the thigh.
There is no news of further fighting at
Opotiki, but some may be daily expected. The
escape of some fifty-three native prisoners from
the hulk at Wellington, effected hythe removal
of a port and dropping into the water or a boat
on a stormy night has caused some sensation.
The principle of keeping these men shut up in a
hulk doing nothing beyond eating and sleeping
has long been condemned by the colonists, and
this second escape may perhaps stir up the
Governor to consent to some more reasonable
plan. They were offered to Otago as hard-labour
men, it may be remembered, bul the offer was
not accepted owing to a mistaken notion that
the chiefs would not work. The old proposal to
deport them to the Chatham. Islands
seems better than allowing the poor wretches to
make their escape and lose a large percentage
by drowning in the attempt-no less than six
out of the fifty-three arc known to have lost
their lives.
'Hie confiscation of half a million »f acres at
Opotiki, will throw into the Government's hands
some of the first land in New Zealand, and the
settlement of half the 1st Waikato Regiment
upon part of it will give security, and therefore
value to the remainder, which can at no distant
date be sold for a good price. The province
of Auckland is promised a further loan of a quar-
ter of a million to enable her"" to deal satisfac-
torily with the ceded Waikato territory, but
how the money is proposed to be used by the
Provincial Executive does not yet appear.
Mr. Weld, the late Premier of this colony,
has announced his retirement from public life
owing to ill-health. Had he done so before he
headed a Ministry he would have carried far
deeper regrets with him than he now can do
from most of the colony.
From the papers, per tho Prince Alfred steamer, wo quote
as follows :
Under the head of Native Intelligence, in the Southern
Cross, that journnl publishes somo ""gleanings"" on the
nativc question, which are not without thoir significance, and
for the accuracy of which it vouches.
Wo learn that many Europeans havo recently ponotratod
into tbo bcai t of the disturbed districts, amongst the Pal
Mnrire fanatics. With several of those tourists, wo have
had an opportunity of speakincr. Starting from Auckland, and
going up to tho Waikato and Thames countries, ono remark
is made by all tourists-namely the diminished numbors of
tho natives. On being questioned regarding the cause of
their decrease, they state that the loss by war did not nearly
so much niTect them as tho loss by disease. Affeotiona of
the throat and chest have been the chief agency in carrying
off (he native people ; and as they have, as a rule, gono book
to the licentious and communistic practices, in voguo
twenty-five or thirty years ago (amongst othors, the whare
piihi), theie can bo little doubt that the mortality witt
increase. . ,
Several gentlemen who penetrated into a comparatively
unknown country, in tho interior, were treated ovcrywhere
with marked respect and kindness. They attribute tats to
what took place a short time previously at Matamata, wita
Thompson. It would appear, as the natives report, that a,
deputation from all tho inland tribes, numbering about tut)
men, waited on Thompson, asking him to lead the tnbos ut
an attack on Auckland. Thompson isBaid to liave asked
.'Do you know tho way to Auckland?"" After a pauso,
the deputation repliod-"" No ; but wo look to you to shoir

once, and! lost one eye. If I try to take it again I fear to
'otc tho other eyo. I made war on Auckland once, ano
Waikato is gone: if I mako war again I may lose

more. Thompson then added-"" As yea represent

questioned whether it was peace or war, the natives invau

'
THE message of Brigham Young, delivered according
to the Salt Lake iVetci, ""orally, on Monday, Feb-
ruary 22nd, to the Senate and House of Represent-
atives of the State of DeBeret,"" at Salt Lake City,
occupies nearly one and a halt columns of that paper.
We make the following extract :
We have met in the capacity of a State Legislature
with a view to preserve our organisation, and with an
eye to the time when, in the wisdom of God, He will
move upon the minds of Senators and Members of
Congrecs to give us oar legal, national, and legitimate
rights. We wait with patience to see this done.
Perhaps to some it «vould seem unnecessary to keep
up this organisation ; but it is that we may preserve
our identity as a part of the nation that we assemble
annually in this capacity. If the machinery
is kept in order, when the time shall come
for the water to be turned upon it there will
be no difficulty in starting it. It is not so much
to enact laws and to sit in a Legislative capacity that
we now meet, as to recognise our rights ; and in
doing so we do no more than others have done and no
more than is our right to do. If we who live in this
country were disposed to meet in this capacity three
hundred and sixty-five days in the year, it would con-
cern nobody but ourselves, except meddlers and those
who wish to infringe upon the rights of our neighbours.
In a republican government like ours it is our right to
meet as we do to-day. We have the undoubted right
to meet together and consult upon those points,of
governmental affairs that pertain to our future peace,
end to gather the necessary information to enable us
to proceed further in the'duties of life. Whether,lin
the providences of God, we Bhall be admitted aa a
State or not we leave with him. He will do as He
pleaseB ; the hearts of all living are in His hands, and
whattver condition He permits us to live in we shall
accept and conform to. Gentlemen, in coming together
to-day as the representa'ives of Deseret, we have the
proud satisfaction of knowing that we represent a people
capable in every respectif governing and controlling
themselves. We in this country have achieved a
freedom and independence such as are rarely pos-
sessed by any people in these days. We raise our
own bread and eat it ; we make our bridges and
streets and pay fur them ; we erect our public
buildings, develope our resources, sustain our Govern-
ment and officers, and are not in debt. That
which is accumulated as income from taxation is
appropriated for the benefit of the people. We have
no bondB in market for greedy financiers to speculate
in, to prove a cause of embarrassment to ourselves
or a vexation and announce to our children. Our
legislators have been wise enough not to go beyond
their ability, and burden the people with a heavy
indebtedness without having resources to refund the
same. Should we be aelmitted as a State, I look for
the snn.e policy to be pursued ; we shall
not fall into debt, _ but always live within
our mennB. This is the secret of succesB
with men, communities, and nations. Take men
in any capacity whatever, whether singly or
otheiwisc, and you will find that if they live within
their means they will be independent and powerful.
It is so in the case of a single individual, ana it is in-
creased))- so with a community or nation. We, as a
people, have had wisdom enough to perceive and act
upon this. A people or Government rtat will suffer,
itself to get entangled through avarice or other causes,'
and bring upon ita people war and indebtedness, and
then poverty and distress, proves that it is not capable
of exercising the proper lights of government. But a
nation that can maintain peace within i's borders and
with its neighbours, exhibits knowledge, wisdom, and
power that muBt eventually call forth the respect and
admiiation of the world. Thus far we have been able
J .to piestive ourselves from such contingencies. It is
true that war has been made upon us ; but the sword
of indignation has fallen harmless at our feet. Yet
o,ur own .wisdom did not produce this; it was by the
powtr and wisdom of God, which He imparts to those
who live eo as to receive them that they may preserve
themselves. j
ON POVEBTV.-111 informed in political economy,
the poor are worse informed in all matters of domestic
economy. Having scant wages to live upon, they
rarely spend those wages in the most prudent and
profitable wav s. They are too often the prey to their
own perverted tastes, and to the tricksters who trade
upon those tastes. They buy bad food, and cook it
badlj ; their bodies ore dirty,"" their clothes are dirty,
their hcmeB are dirty. Disgusted thereby, and
afflicted by the hopelessness of their condition, it is
almost a tule for them to stifle their feelings in un-
wholesome drink ; and thus they pass, from bad to
woice. Every clergyman, every dector, every one who
knows anything of the dwellings of the poor, can give
us instances. without number of the waste
ar.d unthrift that there abound. People whese
earnings are barely enough, with the strictest
economy, to supply their most pressing needs;
practise no economy at all. Families that
have, perhaps, twelve or fifteen shillings a, week
to subsist on, do not get more than eight or ten
shillings' worth of actual subsistence. The rest is
squandered foolishly or viciously. For this the poor
themselves are very little to blame, How can they
be expected to do better when they have never been
taught, when their cares are so overwhelming, when
they have every inducement to despondency and
none to hope ? Yet this is surely a matter in which
charitable persons, charitable women especially, might
exercise their charity with unspeakable advantage.
Much they do ; but very much more has to be done
befe re any important change can be wrought in the
eccnomic habits of our mulions of poor. So muoh
that any thorough reformation must be despaired of,
unlees another branch of education-in correction of
the third sort of ignorance here to be alluded
to, and the most ruinous of all-is also zealously
promoted. No great improvement in the con-
dition and prospects of the poor can be hoped tor
until they are taught to exercise ordinary prudence
in limiting the size of their families in accordance
with their means of decently and healthily maintain-
ing those families. Tbis ÍB not the occasion for dis-
cussing the general question of Malfhusianism, as it
is called. The great law of population, first enunciated
by the Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus in 1798-that
whilst, in the most favourable circumstances, the
food-producing powers of land can only he expected
to increase in an arithmetical ratio, population always
Ur.ds to incieaeo in a geometrioal ratio; and that
accordingly, unleBB the area of population can be
adequately extended, its proper growth U inevitably
restricted by famine, plague, war, and other in-
voluntary checks, if not by voluntary checks
resorted to by man himself-is SB simple and
ir controveí tibie as the Newtonian law of gravition.
At any rate, though many have ridiculed
it, and many more haTe ignored it, no one has
ever seriously attempted to controvert it. Multitudes
have rejeced it without consenting to reason upon it;
but all of the few who have reasonably considered it,
have been ferced to adopt it. The precise bearings of
the law and its detailed applications, however, include
many problems that have yet to be settled. We do
not vet know how rnanv inhabitants our own country,
for instance, can be fairly expected to maintain in
that measure of comfort which all human beings haye
a right to claim ; nor have the possibility and ex-
pedience of drafting off to other and thinly peopled
districts those of our offspring for whom there is no
room in. the me ther country, been properly taken
account of; nor have the special means by which the
law shall be ec forced been dulv investigated and
defined. These questions and others like them are
worihy of careful consideration, and will have to be
considered before long. But we need not, and may
Ineit, wait for that time before recognising the force of
trc law in its relation to the present state of the poor. I

BALANCE OF-THE ANIMAL AND VEOBTAHLE KINODOMS
IN AK AQUARIUM.-In Chamber ft Miscellany we find
the following :- In remarking .upon the result;
of his experiments, Mr. Warrington observes, "" Thus
we have that admirable balance sustained between the
animal and vegetable kingdoms, and that in a liquid
element. The fish, in ita respiration, consumes the
oxygen held in solution by the water as atmospheric
air, furnishes carbonic acid, feeds on the insects and
ycung snails, and excretes material well adapted as a
rich food to the plant, and well fitted for its luxuriant;
growth. The plant, by its respiration, consumes the
carbonic acid produced by the fish, appropriating the
carbon to the construction of ita tissues and fibres«
and liberates the oxygen in its gaseous state to sustain
the healthy functions of the animal life; at the same
time that it feeds on the rejected matter, which has
fulfilled its purposes in the nourishment of the _ fish
and snail, end preserves the water constantly in a
clean and healthy'condition. While the slimy snail,
finding its proper nutriment in the decomposing
vegetoble matter and minute confervoid growth, pre-
vents their accumulation by removing them ; and by
its vital powers"" converts what would otherwise act as
a poison into a rich and fruitful nutriment, again to
constitute a pabulum for the vegetable growth, while
it also acts the important.- part of a purveyor to its
finny neighbours."" This perfect adjustment in the
economy of the animal and vegetable kingdoms,
whereby the vital functions of each are permanently
maintained, is one of the most beautiful phenomena
ef organic nature. In the marine aquarium, the pre-
sence of molluscs is as necessary as in the fresh-water
aquarium, to prevent an excessive growth of con
fen a.-, which otherwise soon make the water turbid
witn their innumerable green seeds or spores, and
obscure the glass by establishing themselves upon it
in vast colonies. The common periwinkle, topshell,
and limpet are very suitable for this purpose.
TUB New York Tribune uses the tallest language in
reporting the ceremony of the 4th instant. Mr.
Lincoln's words are recalled as "" beautiful and elo-
quent,"" and "" the sad spectacle of a drunken Vice
President"" is flung at the back of the out-going
Chief Magistrate. There is not much exaggeration in
this ; indeed, it is not until the Tribune reporter
arrived in the ball room of the Waite House that he
wiitCB "" high falutin."" Then, possibly the united
effect of the scene and champagne induced him to pen
the following rapturous description of the Inaugural
Ball:-""Thebrilliant scene presented within and with-
out the building, radiant in colour, glowing with light,
brilliant like tropical flowers or the plumage of hum-
ming birds, and ever shifting and varying like a many
hued and constantly-changing kaleidoscope. Fahr faces,
lovely forms, penetrant perfumes diffused as the
brilliant robes moved about their wearers ; distin-
guished men, bearing names renowned in war, states
manship, letters, and the other activities of our
crowding life, clothed in the martial uniform, wearing
the orders and diplomatic insignia of their own
sovereignties, or, better still, in the simple if sombro
dress of the American citizen ; all these and much
more met and mingled here. Great waves of music
puh-ated along the heated and perfumed atmosphere,
and the witching mazes of the dance, and the moro
bewitching forms of the dancers-the ladies of coursa
-with all the brilliancy and beauty of colour and
fe rm, made up a scene worthy of pencil or pen*, yet
both must fail in any attempt to render it fitly.""
POSITION OF THE WAK MINISTER.-The Royal
Older which defines the relation of the Commander-
in-Chief to the Queen, the Army, and the War Office^
was published on Saturday. Now that it has been
biought to light, the discovery of the Sangraal should
not be despaired of. Member after member of the
House of Commons has gone in search of it, blun-
dered, gone far astray, lost himself, and then re-
turned to sit down in dumb resignation. The jealousy
with which its official guardians kept their secret, and
their blank complacent look while the representatives
of the public were stumbling about in the dark after
it, vveie admirable in their way, but they are now
things of the paBt. The Order has become
a public document, and now that it is
submitted to the judgment of the country we
expect to hear no more of the dispute whether ^4
the Army is or is not under a dual government.
The Roj al Order, which is dated Balmoral, October,
1861-five years after the Duke of Cambridge had
been appointed to the chief command-defines the
position of his Rojal Highness in no mere incidental
mssner. The purpose for which it was framed is
declared to be ""to prevent any doubts as to the
powers and duties of the Commander-in-Chief.""
The Order does not, however, set forth what those
powers and duties are, but after staling to what
they relate-the government of the Army and the
administration of military affairs-it directs that
"" they ßhall be excepted from the Department of
the Secretary of State for War."" A second para-
graph of the Order completes the purpose of the
tim, by strictly appropriating to the Commander
in-Chief all the powers and business relating to the
matters - aforementioned. The latter are ""to be
deemed to belong to hiß office,"" and to be ad
mini&teied, ""subject to our (the Royal) general
control over the government of the Army, and to the
responsibility of the Secretary of State."" Responsi-
bility for what ? Of course not for the act of the
Commander-in-Chief, whose powers and duties are
excepted from the Department of the Secretary of
State for War, but, as the* Order further explains,
"" for the exercise of our Royal prerogative in that -
behalf, and subject to any powers formerly exercised
by the Secretary at War. No words could more
plainly mark out the position of a great and in-
dependent e fficer of the State, who has the power of a
Minister without a Minister's responsibility. We do
not now ask whether this is an objectionable arrange-
ment, or the best that could be made ; we are only
'calling attention to the evidence of the fact. The
meaning and intention of the Older are beyond
doubt, and so far BB they go they are in derogation
of the principle of responsible government which
Englishmen are sSipposed to value highly.-Daily

THE DECAY 01 THE HOUSE OI COMMONS.
It is very unsatisfactory to find that before the new
Houses of Parliament have been fully completed, they
are actually decaying in parts ; and the same esti-
mates include votes for the building itself, and for the
appliances to arrest the progress of destruction. The
stone of which it is constructed was taken from a
Yorks!: ire quarry on the recommendation of a com-
mission appointed to inquire into the subject, but
almost immediately after being placed in position, this
particular stone began to shew signB of decay. The
facade of the building was marked by large patches,
and the Gothic tracery of the architecture was sadly
disfigured. So far back as 1857 various processes for
preserving the stone were tried on different parts of the
building, and subsequently Professor Faraday and Sir
Roderick Murchison were requested to give their opin-
ions on the relative merits of such methods. They con-
curred in awarding the pre-eminence to the process
of M. Szerelmy, of which the particulars are, of
course, a secret. Professor Faraday, in his report,
said that so far as a judgment could be formed upon
two years' experience, he believed that the process
would sustain its character for a lengthened period, of
time. '' I do not find,"" said the learned professor,
""in other parts of the building,"" where M. Szerelmy'»
application is more than two years old, any signs of
exfoliation, or defection of the prepared face of the
stone, or any grounds for fear in that respect."" The
process has been applied with equal success to the
iron of the roof, which was deteriorating at an equally
rapid rate. Part of it had been coated with »ino or
galvanized iron. This had scarcely been fixed when
it showed signs of preihature oxydation. M.
Szerelmy's preparation was applied to one of the
affected parts, and also to the gilding of the clock
tower. On a careful examination last year, it was
found that the portion treated with the preservative
material was perfectly sound, while the rest of the roof
had suffered more or less from atmospheric influences.
The First Commissioner of Works has accordingly
directed that the remainder of the roof should be
covered with the composition. Meanwhile the stone-
work shews signs of disintegration, and there is som«
ground for the anticipation that, so far as external ap-
pearances are concerned, the new Palace at West-
minster will shortly look as ancient as the venerable
Abbey, which reckons as many centuries as Sir
Charles Barry's costly building can reckon years,
M. Szerelmy's process is capable of application to
many kinds of building materials. Experiments have
been tried on stone, brick, iron railings, and timber,
with very gratifying results. Pieces of timber coated '
with the preparation have been sunk for two year» in
he water at Portsmouth, and are now perfectly sound.
Textile fabrics are also rendered waterproof and in-
destructible by it.
Ar-pAux-iNo ENTERTAINMENT.-Mr. Howard Paul,
who is always indulging in some form of eccentric
advertising, announces in the Daily TsUgraph that he
will give JE6 fur a short sharp title for hil Entertain-
ment at St. James's Hall. We will present him with
one end forego the prize. "" Cheek ! "" That's short
and sharp enough, and in Mr. Paul'« case more or
less appropriate-which cannot be said of all titles.

Tho A. S. N. Co.'s steamer Yaralla arrived hero this
morning. On her passage from Braodsound to Mackay
iho rescued twelve men witli* a whaleboat, off, Cr
talc, part of tho crow of tho barquo Onward, lost
.on tho 15th September, at Blond's Reef, Now Cale-
donia. They wero twenty days in the whale-
boat, the provisions being biscuits soaked with salt
wator. Sixty hands all-told loft tho wreck in fivo boats,
and thoy' separated on the fourth day, the male,
William Bryant, being in chargo of tho whale-boat.
Tho parly wero beating about in the boat for two days,
looking for Huon Island, and tho other boats, for which
island they wero steering. Bryant was afrnid the bis-
cuits would run short, and thoy ran for the Queensland
coast, crossing tlio Barrier about cast of Bell
Bay and made High Peak Inland. Thoy went into
Port Bowen mid Shoal Water Bay, but"" finding no
chanco of relief ran before a S.E. guio and landed on
G Islo on Sunday, tho Oth instant, 6inco
which timo thoy have lived on oysters and
fresh water, of which lhere wero plenty on tho island.
When taken on board Iho men were in a very weak
condition. Heavy rain fell oueo during the passage,
and this enabled them to get a supply of fresh water.
The name-: of the men aro William Bryant, mato;
Thomas Gibb, carpenter; and George Smith, Andrew
Cockrans, ablo seamen ; Samuel Goldsden, ordinary sea-

(From the Times.)
[ Whoever Osman Bey may be, it cannot be denied
that he has written an amusing and instructive book.
His second title, "" Major Vladmimir Andrejevioh,""
seems to imply that he is one of those Russian exiles
who, finding their political or social opinions too ad-
vanced for their native country have fled to Turkey,
taken root in her soil, and there flourished. Against
this theory of his foreign origin must be set the fact
that he writes of the Turks as a Turk-an
enlightened one, be it remarked. ""Nourri dans
le sérail, j'en connais les détours,"" he says
of himself - speaking of "" our "" family,
""our"" harem, and ""our' slaves as though
he had been to the manner bred; while in one in-
stance, when telling us that it is the nature of that
unhappy class which guards Turkish harems to be
either mild and melancholy, or wild and demoniacal,
he mentions that his mother, being the fortunate
possessor of one of the latter kind, got rid of him and
his malignant presence in her household by making
him a present to one of the Sultanas. For the rest,
Osman Bey seeing to have had powerful protectors
among the Pashas-old H- Pasha (Hafiz Pasha)
having been his great friend - to have been
on the Staff and to have served a great
deal in the precincts of the Sultan's Palace.
Supposing him, therefore, to be a real personage,
which there seems little reason to doubt, Osman Bey
was in a position to know his subject and to be
capable of writing with authority, founded on expe-
rience, on "" Women in Turkey."" ne can hardly,
indeed, remember the bad old times when the Slave
Bazaar existed as a public institution at Constanti-
nople, when Circassia belonged to Turkey, and when
the fair maidens of that land, were so common as tobe
comparatively cheap. He had a friend, in-
deed, who used to tell him of the old
state of things, a sort of Turkish Legree—Hadji
Abdallah, of Morocco, a venerable ruffian, near a
century old, whose latter days seem to have been
spent in compelling recalcitrant ladies in the various
harems of Stamboul to be better behaved. Slight
cases of this kind he treated on the spot with stick
and whip ; more obstinate offenders he took in hand
at his own house by starvation and dungeons, and
torture; and it was generally remarked that when
these ladies returned they were 'singularly obedient.
One visit to the old Hadji's house was enough, for, as
one of them confessed, she was afraid lest she should
have been buried alive, a little accident which had
often happened in Hadji's dealings with obstinate
ladies. That was what he did towards the end of his
days. His earlier life had been spent in carrying off
slaves in every possible way, begging, borrowing, and
stealing them, and then selling them in the Slave
Bazaar, in which business he had acquired an ample
fortune.
But to return to Osman Bey, as his experience of
Constantinople does not carry him back more than
twenty or thirty years, it is rather of new Turkey
that he writes than of the old. Though he can re-
member the wild justice which even the mild Abdul
Medjid dealt out to one or two of the friskiest
Sultanas and their favourites, the days of the sack
and the bowstring were pretty nearly over before he
knew Turkish life. It is enlightened Turkey that
he describes, and though he handles his native or
adopted country with comparative tenderness, he can
find no enlightenment for Turkey until the two great
plague-spots of the Ottoman system—the degradation
of women and the existence of slavery—have been
healed. Nor let any reader imagine, that his treat-
ment of these two evils is light and trivial. His book
is no prurient collection of anecdotes raked together
from the hotbed of the harem. He begins from the
beginning, and points out the inherent vice of Ma-
homet's system, in which, while recommending true
believers to have but one wife, he permits them to
have four, and even to add to that number innumera-
ble concubines. In a word the Prophet tried to
cure the evils of polygamy as it existed
before his time in the East and failed.
He gave his followers good advice, while he winked
at the bad practices which he denounced. Slavery,
too, he found engrained in the civilization of the East,
and though he ameliorated it so that the lot of slaves
in Turkey, according to Osman Bey, is comparatively
easy, still he permitted it, and there it exists side by
side with polygamy as one of the curses of modern
Turkey. There can be no real enlightenment in a
country, no element of stability in a system which
at one and the same time looks on woman as an inferior
being and regards her as a chattel or plaything, and
keeps large classes of the community in bondage for the
profit of a peculiar class. Until these flagrant wrongs
have been remedied, Osman Bey sees no prospect for the
continuance of the Ottoman Empire, the existence
of which he declares has been only prolonged by the
jealousy of the Great Powers which surround it.
Were it left to itself, it woudd dissolve into as many
fragments as there are nationalities which profess the
Mussulman faith.
Having thus disposed of polygamy and slavery in
principle, Osman Bey, as one who well knows all
the ins and outs of domestic life in Turkey, pro-
ceeds to give a very lively and amusing descrip-
tion of the Turkish household, as shown in the
respective relations of man and wife, or rather of
a man and his wives. Under the instances of Izzed
Bey and Zerah, an imaginary couple, he shows how
a legitimate Turkish marriage-that is, when a young
well-to-do Turk marries a young lady his equal in
social position-comes after all to be very like what
the proverb tell us is the' fate of those who are rash
enough to buy a pig in a poke. When Izzed Bey
informs his mother or best female friend of his desire
to marry, he need trouble himself no further in the
matter till she comes back, and tells him that she has
found in Zera, a moon-faced, plump young lady, the
object of his affections. It may seem absurd, but Osman
Bey declares it to be true, that it is part of the young
Turkish nature to fall vidlently in love on the spot
with this imaginary object, whom Izzed Bey has
never seen and never will really see till the fatal
moment when, in the bridal chamber, he lifts the rose
hued veil and beholds in the object of his affections
either a houri or a ghoul, or, it may be, a nondescript
something between the two. But so it is ; Izzed
Bey is at once enamoured, worships the tip
of his mistress's little finger when poked
out of a lattice, or her eyes as she whirls by
him in a carriage. So the courtship proceeds till
all is settled between the mothers and a handsome
sum paid down by the bridegroom. At last the
happy day arrives, and all the world hastes to the
wedding to behold the bride standing upright,
veiled from head to foot : to admire the presents,
and to make remarks not always complimentary on
the bridegroom, who has to run the gauntlet of the
sharp tongues of all beholders. Thus the day wears
on, until the happy pair are left alone, and Izzed
Bey lifts Zerah's veil, and either discovers that he
is the happy possessor, of charms which, reckoned
in the Turkish fashion, would be worth, if the bride
were a slave, some three or four thousand pounds,
or the unhappy owner of one or those scraggy, very
plain persons who at the same valuation would be
dear at fifty shillings. In the first case it is quite
possible that the union of Izzefd and Zerah may be
long and happy ; in tho last, it is not likely to last
many moons in a country where mere physical
beauty goes for so much, and where the women are
singularly uneducated
But what is to be done, setting beauty on one
side, if what is known in England as incompati-
bility of temper springs up between the new-married
couple ? Are the Turkish mon and wife bound to
live on chained together? Not at all, if it is the
husband's wish. He has only to say, "" Get away with
three; banish thee from my house,"" and the
poor thing must take heeself off there and then and
never darken his doors again. That is the Turkish
law of divorce, and, be it observed , it is not reciprocal.
No woman can repeat the same words and be rid of a
brute of a husband. One right she has which was
made much of by John Stuart Mill—she has the
entire disposal of her property, whether as a wife or
as a divorced woman ; but, as Osman Bey well points
out, the general condition of women in Turkey is so
absolutely one of dependence on the male sex that a
wife can hardly spend her own money without the
consent or assistance of a husband ; and
if divorced finds herself so preyed on by
adventurers that she is forced in self-defence to
find another husband in order to free herself from
their machinations. But, of course, this speedy divorce
between Izzed Bey and Zerah is not common. Every
ill-assorted union in Turkey is not cut short by those
dreadful words. The unhappy pair may still live to-
gether, and the husband, at least, be made happy.
How? By that gloss called polygamy, which accom-
panies the text of the Koran, which recommends all
true believers to have but one wife Izzed Bey, if he
has the will and the means, may have four wives all
at once, and supplement them with as many slaves
as his pocket can procure. Zerah will always be
his ""first"" wife; but he may take to him another
called ""the second,"" a third called ""the middle
one,"" and a fourth who rejoices in the title of "" the
little one,"" and who, though the last, is usually not the
least in the dear love of her lord. And here arises
one of the great economical objections to polygamy
its expense. Some people in Europe know how costly
Les Femmes en Turquie, par Osman Bey (Major Vladimir
AndreierUlil. P*ds : Catmwi, Levy, and Co. 1878.
one wife can he ; but here, under one and the same
roof, there may be four,-all, be it remarked, with
separate rooms, slaves, and establishments for them
and their children ; all clamouring for fine clothes
and sweetmeats and trinkets, and all expecting
a carriage in which to take the air and
eunuchs on gaily-caparisoned horses to ride
after them. Quite apart from the intrigues of
these ladies against one another, it is clear that
polygamy is a question of money, and at once implies
one law of marriage for the rich and another for the
poor. The ordinary working Turk, if you can sup-
pose so lordly a race ever to work, rubs on with one
wife and a slave or two ; a happier man, no doubt,
than Izzed Bey, who, discontented with Zerah, marks
each step of his rise in life by taking to him a new
wife, until before he is buried himself he may, like
Osman Bey's old patron, Hafiz Pasha, have married
and buried more wives than he could reckon on his
fingers.
And after 'the legitimate wives come the slaves ;
slaves both female and male. As to the first the
Turk hates trouble. But legitimate marriage with
an equal such as we have described in the case of
Izzel Bey and Zerah takes time and trouble. It is
somothing like that heavy form of marriage called
"" confarreatio,"" which got to be so tiresome to Roman
patricians. Why have all this worry when you can
go to some private slave-dealer, for though there is no
slave bazaar, slaves are bought and sold every day at
Constantinople ? Why not go to some modern Hadji
Abdallah and choose for yourself, not at all on the
pig-in-the-poke principle, but by natural selection
face to face ? That is how many of the Turkish
harems are filled with white female slaves, all more or
less valuable in the wife market. It is a horrid
practice, and the Turks ought to blush at it ; only
we remember that young ladies, though, not slaves,
are often bought or sold for wives in other European
countries. As for the male slaves, they are chieily
negroes, and so are the lower female slaves who do
all the hard work in the household, for no Turk
will work if he can help it, and so he must have
slaves. In his own household Osman Bey gives us
an amusing instance of the uselessness of a free
Turkish woman who came in to help. This unfor-
tunate creature was forced to give up the place, be-
cause whenever she had taken off her veil and was
just settling down to her work some man would
pass through the room, when she had at once to
huddle on her veil and turn her back to the in-
truder lest he should behold her face. At last,
in throwing on her veil while she held a lighted
candle in her hand, she set herself on fire, and had
to be put out by Osman Bey himself. The difficulties
of free female labour under such conditions may be
imagined. Our housemaids are bad enough, but what
would they be if they had to jump up and veil them-
selves every other minute lest John or Thomas should
behold their very ordinary faces ? Slaves, therefore,
are necessary to the Turk, both in his marital, his
social, and his domestic relations. They are an institu-
tion, and so long as the present Ottoman system
continues, slaves must form part of the daily existence
of the Turk.
That is, so long as the present Ottoman system con-
tinues, but how long can it be capable of continuing
—we do not say in the recesses of Asiatic Turkey, but
in that portion of the Empire which touches European
civilization, and which, therefore, may and must be
civilized ? The first step to that civilization will be
the emancipation of women from their present thral-
dom ; for, as Osman Bey well insists, "" civilization is
the joint work of both sexes, and to degrade the one
is to fetter and prevent the healthy action and energy
of the other."" The time has come when the
Turk must look at home, and consider what
he really is if he is to continue any longer
a European Power. He must reform and
remodel his social and domestic relations along with
his political system. It is not a question of religion,
for Mahomet, in spite of his fifteen wives, recom-
mended monogamy to his disciples. Polygamy, too,
as we have seen, is a question of money. Few Turks
.can have more than one wife. If they had, the in-
equality of the sexes would be so great that half the
men in the country would be cutting the throats of
the other half for the sake of their women. But how
is the reform to begin ? Not assuredly by any
of those sham concessions which are so well
exposed by Osman Bey in his book. Poly-
gamy in Turkey will not be extinguished by
any such feeble innovations as what he calls
"" Diplomatic Polygamy"" inaugurated, we believe, by
Redschid Pasha, by which plan each high functionary
was to have one diplomatic presentable wife who ap-
peared in society, while he retained his other three
old wives in separate retreats near Constantinople.
This, quite apart from its absurdity, resolved itself,
again, at last into a question of expense.
The new reform in Turkish polygamy must begin
where its evils are most apparent, and where it will
produce the greatest effect on the subjects of the
Sultan. That spot is no less than the Seraglio of
the Sultan himself, of which Osman Bey treats
in the third part of his book. In the harem, or
woman's part of the Seraglio, he has never set foot ;
but he knows every corner of the mabein, or male
quarter, of that immense palace, and he does not
hesitate to say that the social and domestic reform
of Turkey must begin within its walls. What with
the harem with its seven classes of Sultanas, from
the Sultana Valide to the Imperial Princesses with
their separate establishments of ladies and eunuchs,
there are not far from 2000 souls in the harem of
the Sultan. Then on the male side, between
buffoons, musicians, eunuchs, cooks, and dwarfs,
the Commander of the Faithful has more than
1000 attendants to wait on him. Fancy 3000
souls and bodies, all extravagant and grasping, and
reckon how many purses it must cost to maintain the
establishment in the Seraglio. One little fact, if it
be a fact, may show how wasteful the Sultan's ways
are. According to Osman Bey, it wouid he con-
sidered high treason against the dynasty of Othman if
the Sultan ever wore any article, of dress twice. From
the fez on his head to the slippers on his feet he must
have new clothes every day of his life. His tailors
must have no sinecure ; and as for the Sultan himself,
how he must suffer from new coats and pantaloons on
every day ; never allowed to keep any article of his
dress till' he can get fond of it ; and then if he be
enlightened to wear shoes, how his feet must be tor-
tured by a new pair every day. His 400 wives and
their quarrels and their children must be bad
enough, but new shoes every day would be worse.
Seriously speaking, all this barbarous and useless
extravagance must be swept away; the Augean
stable of the Seraglio must be cleansed. The new
Sultan will have hard work to make both ends meet
in future. Let him try to effect that useful process
by a reform which has became a necessity for the
preservation of his Empire.
SroJiTiNoLoitE.-The discovery of bows and arrows,
and also the remains of apparently favourite hunting
dogs in the burial-places of the early Celts, seem (the
Gardeners' Magazine remarks) to prove the war that
was waged by our ancestors against the wild animals
which infested the wide British forests, as well as
with the object of obtaining food. History also tells
that it became a pleasurable puisuit with the early
chiefs, nobles, and kings. The country at that date
was filled with such animals as the wolf, bear, boar, wild
cattle, ns well as the deer, wild swine, goats, &c, which
afforded objects of chase. The wolf, it is well known,
was once very common in England. The month of
January was by the Anglo-Saxons called Wolf
monat, as, according to an old writer, "" people aro
wont always in that moneth to be more in danger to
be devoured of wolves than in any season els of the
yeare."" This animal was looked upon as a type of
courage and ferocity, and, as implying those qualities
which in those days were so highly esteempd, it was
frequently adopted as a name. Thus we find Ethul
wulf, the noble wolf; Berthwulf, the illustrious
wolf, &c. Great pains were taken to exterminate this
dangerous and destructive animal, which appears to
have been first taken in hand by King Edgar, who
commuted the Welsh tribute from gold and silver to
300 wolves' heads. -Edward the First, too, gave re-
wards for their destruction, and, according to Camden,
lands were held by some persons on the tenure of
hunting and killing them. The wild boar was no less
ardently pursije'd. In connection with the boar was
an old supprstrtion that its tusks were hot, and burned
anything which they touched. The heat .of his
teeth was said to inflame any wounds he made,
and burn the hair of the dogs'. Although the hare
was hunted by the ancient Greeks, it was some time
before it became an object of chase with our fore-
fathers, by whom it was considered unclean and unlit
to eat. Ciesar mentions the great numbers of these
animals which he found in Britain. In early times
the fox, whose thieving character had alrcndy ob-
tained for him a bad name, was tiapped, dug out,
speared, or attacked with clubs and arrows, and it
was not till long after that ho obtained the distinction,
of being chased in the modem style.
German Medical Students.- The Official Alma
nack informs us that the number of medical
students entered at the various German schools during
the past year was 0116. Vienna still stands at the
head of the list with 756 students, while Berlin counts
only 281, coming sixth on the list after Prague.
Strasbourg has 222 students ; Heidelberg, 84 ; while
Rostock, the lowest on the list, has -only 34.

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1871.
THE terrible events of Paris have set all
persons accustomed to inquire into the causes
of things to endeavour to expound those which
Have led to this fearful episode in the history
of civilization. The strength of the rebellion
and the destruction which it wrought, the
terrible sacrifice of life in its suppression,
and the apparent reappearance of its elements
in another form, have filled the world with
wonder and with alarm. ""Where is it all to
end?
The highest form of civilization existing in
Europe has, by common consent, been attri-
buted to Paris. The moat perfect examples
of skill, both in science and in art, have been
furnished by its population. It was the most
beautiful city, and had the greatest range of
pleasures of every kind, and in the most perfect
order. Europe received from the French
theatre its popular plays, It received from
the same source its universal fashions. Luxury
pf all kinds was carried to the highest per-
fection in Paris. Nowhere was the art of
cookery capable of producing such diet. In no
'country could all the adornments of the house,
of the person, of the table, be so readily
'assembled. The rich people of eveiy nation
hastened to Paris to partake of these splen-
dours and these pleasures, which continued
throughout the season without intermission.
The citizens of this great metropolis of gaiety
and enjoyment looked with complacency on the
. gathering of all people to pay homage to their
intelligence, skill, and boundless resources.
.Those who look back two or three years to
'what Paris was-say, when the Great Exhibi-
tion attracted all the world-and what Paris
has become, may well be stunned with aston-
ishment or moved with pity. All this
splendour and plensure passed away, and the
city finally fell under the power of its loweßt
inhabitants, who endeavoured to gain its con
tiol, to subject its wealth, its intelligence, its
refinement, all it possessed, to a domination
which, when embodied in the persons of
ihose who wielded it, strikes the mind with
absoluta terror.
A splendid paper has been contributed to
the Revue des Deua Mondes, by M. E. CAKO,
on one phase of this great phenomenon,
entitled, "" The End of Bohemia, or the lite-
rary Influences in these Last Events.*' This
treatise attributes the Communist Revolution
to the ascendancy of that class created by the
refinements and the yicissitudes of the great
city. A Bohemian signifies, in French phrase,
a writer living by ephemeral literature, an in-
ferior artist of any kind, a member of the
medical or legal orders without patients or
clients.-any person, in short, thrown upon
the casualties of a calling, and dependent
day by day upen the fluctuating success of a
profession. It is from this class have arisen
the writers who have corrupted, or at least
expressed the ¡corruption of, Parisian society.
I They are principally persons who have no
recognised position, no established reputation,
who live day by day having this question
continually recurring, Where shall we dine, and
how shall we pay for our meal ? They live on
the margin of society, in isolation. They are
devoured by envy. Their chances are an
election to the academy of France, or a place in
the hospital or^in the morgue. These persons,
having no recognised status in society, have
made themselves the expounders of every senti-
ment which divides and corrupts it. They
have produced a literature only copied faintly
| in the English publications. All the bad
passions of mankind have been analysed and
laid open in the mocking tone of those who share
them, who have boasted of them, and who haye
been destroyed by them. They have professed
no moral principle, they have offered no ideal,
they have animuted no effort for the improve-
ment of mankind. They have put, without
disguise, the defects and disordeis of society
into the language of derision, and, while they
have lessened the respect for human nature
as a whole, they ha\e been equally opposed to
all those institutions which have been de-
signed to raise the fallen and solace the dis-
tressed. Their lessons have been intended to
excite a hatred against the persons of men, an
envy of their good fortune, and of those
superiorities which arise from knowledge or
industry. The only tone in which they have
been known to addiess the unhappy portions
of society has been calculated not to relieve
but to exasperate their resentment. They
have said to the vicious that they have been
made so by the organization of society; to
those who have found it difficult to live, that
the rich have taken away their natural right to
their portion in this world. All that society
has secured by united labour foi the go»d of
the State has been treated as deductions from
the daily enjoyment of the workman. The
employers of labour have been always spoken
of as criminals, who are joined together in con-
spiracy against the operatives.
The consequence of thiB kind of ""education,
continued for twenty years under the shadow
of an Imperial system, was to produce a fixed
hatred of everything that existed and a
desperate determination to reverse, to over
tlnow, and to sweep all that had been ex-
hibited as the representative of wealth or dis-
tinction. It is this literature which has found
in tiie daily Press a full development for the
last two years. The relaxation of the
laws and the fall of the Empire gave
still fuller scope for these opinions.
The conduct of many prominent persons
afforded the text of satire and denunciation.
During the siege of Paris the clubs were j
ruined, and the Bohemian class made them the
medium of their propagandism. Men, women,
and children attended these assemblies, and
the most extravagant oratory found the
warmest reception. There were two classes of
speakers. Commonly the orators of the work-
ing class had somo degree of sincerity. But the
old leaders weie mete actors ; they were
. obtaining a living or a place without any
faith in the principles which they proclaimed.
They had experienced a long trial of patience.
Their contribution* to the Press could not in
ordinary times provide them with bread. The
revolution carne lo float them upon the surface.
When the Commune was proclaimed they
seized its guidance. They appropriated
the profits upon which they could
lay their hands, and, without believing in the
permanence of anything, turned to present
account the wild rage of those who were
incapable of discerning their delusions. The
number of men of this class who assumed
omeo in the Commune was remarkable. They
had a degree of education, of science, and
knowledge of society, but they had long been
nmong the disinherited. What a change,
then, to become, even for three months, the
dignitaries of a great city, and to command
an army of 100,000 men.
A remarkable development of the Commune
was the prominence it gave to some female
politicians. The emancipation of woman was
a grand cry. Lectures were delivered and
journals published by them in this interest.
The incidents of the last revolution show how
frightful was the demoralisation of Communist
women. i
Among the stimulants of mischief with
which the Bohemian had been long familiar
is to be reckoned the use of absinthe. This
dangerous liquor produces a special kind of
frenzy more pernicious than ordinary spirits,
and more maddening than opium. It is im-
possible to say how far even this agent of
human degradation is responsible for the crimes
of the revolution.
The author attributes the character of this
insurrection to the utter absence of religious
principle in the Bohemian class. While the
savons and philosophers have been propound-
ing the doctrines of atheism in elegant lan-
guage, and as the means of liberating the
mind from all prejudices, the lower classes
of writers have accepted their conclusions, and
surrounded them with all the decorations of
an obscene literature. Every excitement to
the indulgence of the passions has been pro
¡ duced in their writings ; and their whole
s) stem - has been based on negations. Is
there a GOD? No. Is there a future
state'? No. IS there a soul? No. Is
there responsibility for tinknown actions'?
There is none. Is theie any compensation
for patient suffering? Never. Is there any
reason for the relations of social life ? No
These have been the set of principles with
which Communism has started There are
numbers who have professed to substitute
others for them ; but these at present have
remained in all their deadly influence, and
havö shown themselves in the terrible events
of this last civil war.
AN , interesting discussion took place a few
.months ago in the Ilouse of Commons in
relation to harbours of refuge on the English
coast. The question involved the considera-
tion of a large variety of facts, commercial,
humanitarian, and national. The debate arose
on a motion by Lord C. J. HAMILTON, whose
object was to obtain a grant of public
money for the construction of a harbour of
refuge at Filey in Yorkshire. The policy
of making further grants of public money
to construct and improve harbours of refuge
on the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland
had been the subject of inquiry and solici-
tation during the previous fourteen years.
A committee recommended that national money
should be granted for the construction
of harbouis of refuge, and that funds
should also be voted towards the extension
and improvement of existing harbours. It
was also proposed that a commission of
inquiry should -visit the coast for the pur-
pose of inquiry. This was delayed by
change of Government ; but the commis-
sioners having been appointed, brought up
a report recommending that £2,365,000
should be granted, with loans at a low
tate of interest for harbours, on condition
that cci tain stated local suma should be
raised to meet the national grants. These
facts were stated by Lord HAMILTON, who
also gave an account of the numerous
attempts which had been made in vain to
give practical effect to the report of the
commissioners, which, however, was opposed
on the ground that it was "" altogether too
sweeping."" Mr. MILNER GIBSON, when Pre-
sident of the Board of Trade, incurred con-
siderable odium by his opposition, and when
sailors were drowned on the coast, there
were those who did not hesitate to speak
of the widows of those unfortunate
seamen, as "" MILNER GIBSON'S widows.""
Attempts to induce the House to adopt the
report of the commissioners were renewed in
each session from 1862 to 1865, and the sub-
ject was revived in 1866 and 1869, but without
any results satisfactory to its promoters.
Among the commercial facts adduced during
the debate it was stated that the trade was
most extensive on the north-east coast, and
that its harbours were barred, and there-
fore not approachable at all tides. It was
ghen in e-vidence that the entire tonnage of
British sailing vessels clearing coastwise from
ports in England was 8,162,000 tons ; coast
wajs and foreign together, 15,796,00<>; and
that the annual loss to the nation by wrecks
ivas a million and a half sterling. But since
that e\idcnce was given there had been a very
laige increase in the foreign as well as in
the coasting trade. The total foreign and
toasting trade in 1857 was 23,178,782 tons
(Blitish ships), or an average per month
of 1,931,565 tons. But in February of the
present year, the total foreign and coasting
trade was 5,156,000 tons. Taking the coasting
trade only there was a considerable increase
shown. In 186-9, the coasting trade for the
month of February showed 2,587,000- tons.
In February, 1871, it represented 2,684,900
tons. Lord HAMILTON, speaking of the
fisheries on the coast, quoted from the report
oí the Commissioners of Fisheries in 1866,
to show that the annual value of the fisheries
on the east coast was £2-,000,000, and that
""the north-east coast fisheries were of the
same extent as the supcrfitial area of
Ireland, and were annually increasing in
value to the extent of £10,000 per
annum."" The Boaid of Trade re-
turn showed, iL that the number of re-
gistered fishing boats in England was 16,195,
representing 127,013 tons, and employing
I 47,290 men, and 7467 boys.""
These figures, indicating the large commercial
interest at stake, were not disputed, and facts
were given te show how gieat are the advan-
tages which may be expected from an improve-
ment of the harbours on the coast. As in this
colony in regard to railways, so there appears
to have been in the House of Commons on
this matter much local rivalry, and
the question divided itself into two main
branches - first, as to the expediency
of spending large sums of money on one
harbour of refuge, when (it was arguod)
"" unless '.they were multiplied almost ad
wßnitum they would be of very little use;"" |
and, second, as to how far Government
assistance ought to be extended towards the
improvement of harbours. It was stated by
one member that the Government had advanced
money on easy terms to the Tyne Harbour
commisioners. Another observed that the
sum of £1,600,000 had been spent during the
last few years in improving the approach to
the Tyne Uiver so as to render it a good
harbour of refuge ; that most of the
money was made a local charge ; and
that, in consequence of the improvements
effected, a herring fishery had been estab-
lished there. By an Act passed in 1861,
money may be granted for harbour improve-
ments on condition that it be repaid, with
interest, in twenty years. The Tyne Harbour
commissioners had availed themselves of
these harbour loans; but it was remarked
that they had not done so to such an ex
lent as they would otherwise have been
glad to do had the interest not been in-
creased. They obtained £100,000 at 3J per
cent., and another £100,000 at 3.J per cent. ;
but the Government after that refused to
lend to them at less than 5 per cent.,
and the commissioners became reluctant to
borrow on those terms.
From a national standpoint it was argued
that Filey ought to bo made a harbour of
refuge. It was contended that the events
of the past few months had altogether
altered the military position of the country;
that England had now to look for danger
norn the East, and that therefore the |
construction of a naval station on the east
coast was a matter of serious moment. It
was also remarked by the mover that
Filey was recommended by the committee of
1857 from a strategetical point of view-1
that it would be good as a look-out, and
safe for shipping in time of war. Several
authorities were quoted showing the import-
ance of a naval station on the east coast,
and these were supplemented by arguments
based on local considerations.
The humanitarian reasons urged recall the
dangers and sacrifices annually made in the
cause of commerce and navigation - the
terrible disasters which occur to vessels baffled
by winds and unable to weather rocky
points - ships with torn sails and broken
masts left to the fury of a gale - the
foundering of vessels unable to find a
pott of refuge, and long lines of coast
black with wreck. The members were
reminded of "" scenes of agony which
beggared description,"" and certainly the loss
of life shown is most lamentable. All this
was admitted by the Government. Mr.
GLADSTONE quoted from a Parliamentary
paper the number ©f shipwrecks which had
occurred during eleven years, showing that
1480 lives had been lost on the south coast,
1240 on the north coast, and 2772 in the
Irish Sea. But the inference he drew from
the figures was, that there was no
material différence to be traced be-
tween those portions of the coast which
had harbours of refuge, and those which had
not. The policy of the Government was
clearly stated to be in favour of an improve-
ment in the mercantile marine, and it was
held that a reckless plan for a wholesale
creation of bar-harbours would have the effect
of retarding that improvement. It was argued,
however, on the other side, that much re-
mained yet to be done, inasmuch as it could'
not be denied, in the face of wrecks so
numerous, that many ships went to sea in
an unsafe condition.
But the most fatal objection to the propo-
sition appeared to be its local- application ;
and upon this point Mr. GLADSTONE and
Mr. LOWE spoke out boldly. The former
said he could not do otherwise than euter
his protest against local propositions of the
kind, "" because they were a fruitful source
of political demoralization."" Mr. LOWE said :
-"" The noble mover did not propose to fol-
low the general spirit of the recommendation
of the Commission, but picked out one iso-
lated point, with respect to which the Consoli-
dated Fund was to contribute all, and local
resources nothing. A more fatal blow, not
only at the Exchequer, but at the reputation
of that House, could not be imagined. He
had some experience on such a point. He had
been a member of a Colonial Assembly, the
greatest part of the time of which was taken
up in discussing measure» such as the noble
lord now proposed, involving the application
of general revenue to local purposes, such as
the making of a road in one place, or the con-
struction of a railway in another. The main
time of the Legislature was occupied in that
most discreditable manner, and he, therefore,
ventured from practical experience to warn
the House not to encourage such motions as
the present, for it would find no course so
injurious to the respect and estimation it
should be held in by the 'public as countenanc-
ing the grant out of the general revenue of the
country of money to be expended for local
purposes.""

'i hey are still getting splendid stone from the 40 foot lovel.
The company aro ulse erecting] a battery of six head'of

expected to bo at work in about a month's time, [
We understand McsBrs. Cox' and Rouso havo purchased
a fourth of M'Clymont and party's ground (16'acres).
Ihey intend putting m a tunnel to cut tho roof at j st dopth
of about 300 feet. Carter and party are still raising fiist
class stone. On account of tho bad state bf the reads they
bave been unable to get their stone into the barks, so that
they havo postponed their crushing for an indefinit« period,
'lhey aro down to a depth of 43 'feet The reef has
increased in thickness very muoh, averaging. 2 feet, and
showing gold as freely as ever. J( "" ,i
Holioid and party, adjoining, are still sinking. for the
reef, and have every indication of cutting it oro long. '
No. 1 North, Smith and party, aro still driving at a dopth
of 67 feet, lhey havo cut several leaders, and expect to cut
the main reef in other 3 feet at most. .,
No. 2, Campbell and patty, are idle.
Goninon's Reef.-The prospectors are still vigorously
Sushing forward the work. They aro now about 60'feet
eep ; broke down about 4 tons of stone to-day, averaging
fully 20 inches in thickness, and showing an encollent
prospect, lhey ore also putting in a tunnel along the reef
to the south at a dopth of 40 feet, and are in about 26
feet.
{ No. 1 North, after being at a standstill for a month,
resumed work about three weeks ago, but havo not brokon
down any stone yet. > '

I -'?
(Trum the Special Corrcsjmnlent of the Standard.) \
TUE European Consuls have been so profoundlj' im-
pressed by the misery of the refugees, who are
crowded together in Constantinople, and are, more-
over, so apprehensive that the epidemics which
have already made their appearanco amongst us
will increase in intenbity and fatality, that they
haye met for the purpose of considering how the
existing and yet impending evils niny best be
averted. It is believed that they will urge the
Government to adopt some such plan as that which
1 am about to describe. They will recommend that
for the purpose of restoring the refugees to their
homes, or where that cannot be done, for the purpose
of sending them into Asia, the Government shall
obtain an advance of from £200,000 to £250,000 from
the local bankers ; and that with a view to give the
local bankers due security for the repoj-roent of the
advance, tilo dutj' on all goods passing through the
Custom-house shall he raised from 8 per cent.-the
present uniform rate-to 10 per cent., the additional
2 per cent, being applied to the payment of the
adv ance. They will also propose that the »um raised
for tile benefit of the refugees Bhall ho administered
bj- a mixed European Commission. The scheme is
excellent. The additional tax is not great, and it
woidd bopaid chiefly by the well-to-do classe». The
money raised would be well and even remuneratively
expended, since it would be expended in the transport
of labour to the fields which are almost denuded of
those who should till them. Constantinople would
thus be relieved of a very great aud pressing danger.
But I do not think it is at all probable that
the scheme can he carried out. The existing
Customs duties are established under treaties with
foreign Powers, and even if European diplomacy
could be induced to reconsider those treaties
with a view to their amendment, it would
hardly complete its task in the lifetime of the
refugee». I fear that to the greater part of these un-
fortunates the grave alone can bring relief. I see
much of them, and the more I see of them, the more I
am impressed by their patient, and even cheerful,
resignation under trials which daily become more and
more intense. The situation is always becoming worse,
for the conduct of the Bulgarians is such that none of
the Mahometan refugees will return to their homes,
whilst most of the Moslems who have not already left
Bulgaria, aro preparing to fly from the brutality of the
Slavs. In addition to this, an exodus is now
taking place from Epirus and Thessaly, so we aro
likely to be overwhelmed by a fresh crowd of 'fugi-
tives. Meanwhile, the Porte continues to bring fresh
recruits to the capital, in which, and in the neighbour-
hood of which, there are now one hundred and eighty
battalions of Turkish soldiers.
The dissensions among the Ministers have arisen to
such a height that the Administration is paralysed,
and nil business stands still, while the partisans of
Russia and those of England struggle for the
mastery. I ara told that yesterday the Council had
under consideration n fresh Note from Russia,
making a final demand for the strategical position»
described in my previous letters, and that it had
also under consideration a counter Note from
England, protesting against the cession of these
positions to Russia, and stating that if they were
ceded it would he necessary to take immediate
measures for the protection""of English interests
against the combined hostility of Turkey and Russia.
The Council could como to no decision with regard to
these note», and when it broke up Mehmed Ruchdi,
who has recently been made a Minister without a
portfolio, and who is expected bj- some to replace
Ahmet Vefyk, proceeded to the Sultan to inform him
of the subject which the Council had had under con-
sideration. The Sultan, in the hope of gaining time,
proposes to ask the mediation of the French Ambas-
sador, but the strategical positions which Russia and
England demand are so important to cither nation,
that the mediation of the French Ambassador is net
likely to be effectual. At the same time, the conduct
of Austria gives the Porte other causes for uneasiness,
Austria demands to be allowed to occupy Bosnia and
the Herzegovina, avhere the insurrection has assumed
dangerous proportions, and is preparing to move her
troops. The Porto refuses the required permission,
and throws on Austria the responsibility of the
disastrous consequences which must follow from the
occupation. This, however, is not likely to prevent
the occupation. Lastly, Italy is taking a very
lively inteicst in the insurrection in the Greek pro-
vinces, and is showing phainly her fixed determina-
tion to be present when the time arrives for the
partition of Turkey. Under these circumstances, the
Russian party gains strength &»ily, and -will probably
triumph. The Sultan and the Pachas are clinging,
naturally enough, to their capital, and will do any
thiiiE it only tiley may retain their hold upon it.
Apparently the Russians are far f rombeing unwilling to
allow the Sultan to have a further tenure of power in
Constantinople, and they are thus in a position to bid

Mr BUCHANAN opposed tho motion
Mr S C BROWN said, nllhough ho was open to Hit
charge of not having attended lory much to his duties
during tho present session, yet knowing that his absence
had been from inability to attend, ho tolt no scorpio in
lotwg for tho motion Ho thought if tho Government
w ero to accept tho ndvieo gil cn thom by hon membors op
pósito, they w ould be guilty of a breath of f util and bo un
worthy to rotam their scuts. The motion must bo con
sidered OB if tho Goi eminent woro bound togo on, and
their bills as if the A] piopnntion Act li id not Icon passed
It w ns nfter all a question of tho bnlnnco of com ouionce
and it w ould be Burch moro com enient to gi\ o an additional

lion members had said there was no unpoitmt business
onthcpnptr, but there wns tho Superannuation Bill, nu I
the prêtent state of that question was ii disgrnco to tho
country Theienas also tho Border Duties question tole
considered, ind hkowibo tho Mining Bill The fact tint
this bill contained 174 clauses, and therefore would take a
long timo, was another reason for having an additional day
A fresh department to deni with Innung m tttets had been

any Government to let it rest now 1 ho loan estimates,

them would also take sonio timo Then thoro was
the Uppoi Houso Bill, which waa down for second reading
AVhcn they saw all theso things upon the ]apcr, and

Mr ROBERTSON said ho did not know any man m
the House who had not desired to pass tho Appropriation
Act The Opposition had remained there st indmg by tho
Estimates, and desiring to haio them carried But it was
really suipnsmg that tho hon member for Nowtown should
tell them that tho present motion was only a matter
of com emente Ho submitted that far higher ques-

asked hoa members whether it was in their powoi to givo

their minds clear and capablo of dculing with tho questions
before them nifcht after night Ho should como if tlioj sat

matter of conicnnnce Ho rejected tho idea that thoy weio
so lowered in rcgnid to their desire for tho public weal that
thci would only deal with this matter as ono of com onienco
Ho looked upon that view of it as utterly contcniptiblo
Ï hey w ere called upon to deal with a number of measures
of ai cry peculiar kind which would require, if thoy gai o
proper attention to them, a great amount of timo T ¿ko for

whowos perfectly familiar with tho matter, to bo prepared
to deal with it on the following day, but other hon gon
tlcmen were in a diflcrent pobition How were hon mem-
bers to deni with the mattei unless thoy had an opportu-
nity of reading the papers It w as a matter of labour, and
ono miolvmg a hue, o amount of thought It was n matter
which if (hey desired to do jubtito to their own delegates,
they should approach with a thorough understanding of it
Then there nab tho Mining Bill If hon members gai o
proper attention to this matter it would inioho a vast

even excepting the lion Premier, had gncn their attention
to tho bill Ho did not think EO ill of tho hon

its tflccts would bo, ho would ho thcro supporting it Ho

Mr BAKER thought tho motion fo an extra sitting

assent lhere woio several very important mensuro»
bcfoie the Houso which should bo dealt with this session
If only those which had been montioned by the lion,
member for the lumut wcro dealt with, it would tako a
long time if tho Houso sat only four days a week lh»
Government would alienate some of its supporters, and o
gnat deni of the support of people out of doors, if thoy
allow ed such important mensures to stand oier for thrco
or foui mouths In tho speeches that had been mndo on
thepusent motion, Uio convenience of country members
lind been overlooked Sonio consideration should surely be
given lo them It appeared to lum that our sessions wer»
too long Ho thought tho House of Commons not only sit
five nights a week, but it had two morning sittings as noll.
Ab far as tins colony was concerned, ho would ho only too
ha] pi if the Houso could always tako Monday as a sittmg
dni, foi they then might get through tho business of tho
session m three or foul months, instend of dragging it on
to hi e or six Such a stato of things w ould bo bettor for
the country, for the Government, and for country members
Iho chnrgo which bud been brought ngninst tho Govern-
ment of wasting tho lime of tho HOUBO was not just,
leinuse the Government, having tho Appropnntion Act,
could pioroguo at nnv timo thoy liked but, mstoad of
doing so, they not only enmo forward with measures of
mi] oitanco to tho country, but nlso asked for an oxtn day
to enable them to deal with thom In all this thcro waa
certainly no appeal anco of shirking their duly Eiersinco
he had been a member of tho Houso ho noticed that tho
tactics of every Government up to tho prosent timo had
been to mnko tho session as long and tho recosa
as short as was possiblo, but now when thnro
w is a Government who desired lo m uko a radical chango for
tliebcltei, theyweio met with all manner of opposition
when the} onli asked for n littlo moro timo to onablo thom
to keep up to then work Ihero weio thrco measures that
w ci o imperiltn c1} required to be passed-tho Mining Bill,
the Upper House Bill, nnd Uio Supeiannuation Bill but
vei} little discussion would bo required on either of these,
for the Mmmg Bill had been alieady dobatcd, and had
been long befoi o thellouso, the Up] 01 Houso Bill contained.
only ono or two mam principles, and tho superannuation
question had been fairly worn threadbare by discussion
Thus, hon niombcrs ought to hal o mado up then minds
upon tho whole of them, and ought to ho prepmed to doal
with them without delny, nnd ho would only add th s, that
if S} dnoy members could not spnro timo to attend tho
nicotings of tho Houso on Mondays, thoro wore country
membcis who would do so, mid bo quito ready to tako thoir
pinces, so that there should bo no fear of tho want of a
quorum.
Mr. MACINTOSH intended te opposo this motion of the
bon. Premier, and regarded it only ns anothor schemo to
waste tho timo of tho House. Thoy had a Mayor in the
City Council, who, when ho wanted to bo economic,
brought a lot of dcbatnblo correspondence boforo tho alder-
men m older to set them talking, and to waste tho time,
so that thoy should not havo it in their power to volo away
tho city money. Mr. Parkes seemed to havo taken a loaf
out of the Mayoi's book, by setting his followers forward to
waste the timo of tho Houso by speeches and motions,
so aB to prevent tho real business from being reached. It
would bo impossible to have n short session so long as such
a number of unimportant motions wero brought forward te>
tnko up tho time, and such lengthy speeches wero mad»
when a really important question was boforo tho Houso.
He had remarked too that it was tho Bupporters of the
Goiernment who wtro tho most to blnmo, and this made it
appear to him as if it was a set pinn of the Government.
If ho thought that by carrying tliiB motion tho session
would bo shortened, ana that tho Houso would
bo nblo to meet ngnin in Juno or July,, so that
they might havo the business disposed of by Christ-
mas, ho would not object to it. If an Act
were passed making it compulsory on tho House to pass the
Appropriation Act every year before Christmas, ho would
i oto for Monday being a sitting day ; but, as things now
stood, ho believed it would only bo giving anothor day for
these unimportant motions and discussions of whioh tUpjr
had already had so many. His everionco had shown him

{From the London Review.)
ONE of the most remarkable facts which the
historian of the future must take into account
in estimating the forces that have governed
progress in our age and country is, in spite of
Mr Buckle, the individual influence of a great
man. At whatever department of thought we
glance, we distinguish, by comparison with the
conditions of twenty years ago, the unmis-
takable stamp of one mind. Within the period
named, the experiential school of philosophy,
which had almost disappeared from the country
of Locke, driven out by a crude deluge of
German transcendentalism, has been raised
almost to scientific perfection, has been formu-
lated, criticised, cleared of obscurities. In-
ductive logic, since Bacon's time practically
regnant in England, has vindicated as well a just
philosophical supremacy The great problems
of social and intellectual freedom have been
boldly shaped into a grand code of tolerance, to
which even bigots are now compelled to yield
at least a lip worship Among our public men
and writers a broader view of responsibilities,
class pretensions, and national claims has begun
to prevail Both in theoretical and practical
politics the narrow selfishness, which aped
Utilitarianism but was really its antithesis, has
been to some extent discarded and now, if we
have not quite escaped the taint of party bitter
ness in political discussion,we have at all events
the gratification of seeing that the number is
ever increasing of thinkers and even statesmen,
who set philosophy above intrigue and petty
private interests On the whole we are
justified in the boast - though we see
more promise as yet than performance
that this generation is less the slave of
prejudices and formulas, more earnest, more
thoughtful, more logical than that which imme-
diately preceded it It would be difficult to
over-estimate the share in this distinct and
welcome advance which is due to the personal
influence of Mr John Stuart Mill.
Mr Mill's earlier appearances as an anony-
mous wrnter were of a very varied kind
Poetry, history, and fiction, were among the
subjects of his keen impartial criticism But
after the publication of his great works on
political economy and logic, wc find that he
limits his labours to the severer walks of study,
in which he has become illustrious is an
authority 'Hie third volume of his collected
essays, which lies before does not include
any enuc d discussions such as these on Alfred
de Vigmy in the first volume, and on Michelet's
History of France in the second Politics and
metaphysics divide tins latest republication of
Mr Mill's periodical writings Under the
former he id ni ty be included the valuable papers
""'Thoughts on Parliamentary Reform,"" and
""Kettnt Writers on Reform,"" winch appeared
during tht discussions attenelant on the appear-
ance ol Mr Disraeli's Bill of 18V), as also ' A
Few Words on Non-intervention,"" and "" Hie
Contest in Amené i,"" rejinnted from /Vene; t
JUai/tizitir 'Hie el.iboi ite and exhaustive
criticism on ' Vustin s Lectures on Juris
piudcncc"" occupies to s0nie extent a neutral
ground between the foregoing strictl) political
et-sajq, and the two importint contributions to
mental science whim lorni pirt of the same
volume-tin disstnations on Ham's Pi)clio
log),"" and "" Grotc's Plato '
The governing principle of all Mr Mill's
teaching, whether in polities, in social science,
or in philosophy, may be fairly descrubed as an
enlightened and systematised individualism li
we assume, »t is tlie almost tinivcrsjl custom
with Englishmen, that any attempt to base
society on the idea of fraternity must be per
nicious. and is to be denounced as Socialist and
revolutionary, we shall find in Mr Mill's system
the most admirable type of modern develop
ment Where the political economy of others
is hard anti narrow, his takes a broader view,
and docs not arrogate an irrational dominion
over the higher instincts of human nature
Thus we find that ulonc, after Adam Smith, Mr
Mill has put Ins favourite science into i form
not repulsive to those bene'olent aspirations
which no science can extinguish in man In
the same way he has softened down the harsher
traits of the utilitarian philosophy, as it derived
itself from Bentham In politics, the tin
Radicalism of his fathtr, James Mill, and his
school, has been vivified and informed with i
new soul by that noble chapter in the "" Political
Economy ' on ' '1 he Probable Futurity of tne
Labouring Classes, ' by the "" Essay on Liberty,
and the ' Representative Government"" And
those students ol mental philosophy who wotilel
have rejected the gross materialism of Hartley
and Condillac can recognise in the refutation
of Hamilton a metaphysical theory which
neither revolts the logical sense nor the
spiritual nature It is this apt combination of
the strictest principles of individualism with a
generous enthusiasm for everything that is just
and noble, which has gained for Mr Mill his
wide and potent sway over the mind of
England Resting as that sway does, on the
free allegiance of the mest enlightened and the
most ardent spirits among the younger genera
tion of Englishmen, it must, beyond question,
be extended and strengthened with mere lapse
of time How far this philosophy can be con
sidered an ultimate growth admits of more
doubt It ein only be supplanted, however, ii
at all, by a system based on the solidarity of
mankind, and on theories which only a few
thinkers in this country regard as other than
hopeless unattainable dreams
Almost cvtiy page of ihe volume befoie us
furnishes us with in example of Mr Mills
power over opinion To him is due the grow-
ing interest felt by the public in Mr. Hare's
scheme of personal representation, and the
glowing toleration accoided to its discussion
'lins plan is very cekariy the very apothcosis of
individuihsm in the domain of practical politics,
and, as such, will never meet with the approval
of those who regard rather the action of the
popular will through masses than the divlsion of
the State into little groups of personal interests
It is so very improbable that we can go so far in
the wat of recasting our institutions as to adopt
Mi Hare's ingenious machinery, that the ques
tion is practically taken out of the sphere of
useful debate, since we believe even Mr Mill
himself, in bringing it under the nonce of the
House of Commons, rather desires to assert
the principle than hopes to establish the
actual change A more real benefit, in our
present effort to complete some satisfactory
representative Reform, may be derived from
Mr Mill's sensible statement of the advantages
of grouping, in a redistribution of seats Wh lt
ever ma) be the fate of the fianeluse clauses of
the present Government Bill, no one believes
that Mr Disraeli's redistribution plan has an)
chance ol fav omable acceptation In this
point, however, the scheme of last year was
very little better, and was open to all the ob
jections which Mr Mill ably urges against
Lord John Russell's Bill of 1852 in view of
some probable modifications of the grouping
system being proposed by one or other party,
the following remarks on the radical vice of
previous propositions will be found interest-
ing -
"" ""i et, if the principle of combining several boroughs
was once admitted, what course could be more obii
t>ovb than to taut all the present boroughs, and nil
unrepresented towns of more than a certain amount of
population (bay, for example, oOOO), and leaving out
all those, w hellier existing as boroughs or still tobo
created, avhose importance entitles them to one mem-
ber, or more than one, of their own, to arrange the
others in groups according to geographical conveni-
ence, care being taken lo give to each group something
like the same number ol electors No reason is appa-
rent tilly this plan was not adopted, except the mis-
placed scruple against merging two existing boroughs
into one if what is now i borough is to beeomo
one ol a group, what difference can it make to the elec-
tors whether thev ure bound up with existing, or only
with newly enfranchised re electors 5 What couldbe

when, the Hungarians having shown themselves likely
to prevail in tins struggle, the Kussian despot inter-
posal, and joining his force to that of Austria, de
livered back the Hungarians, bound hand and foot, to
their exnsperated oppressors, it would have been an
honourable and virtuous- act on the part of Lngland
to have declared that this should not be, and that if
Russia gave assistance to the wrong side, England
would aid the right It might not have been consultent

its own safety for Lngland to have taken up this posi-
tion single-handed But Lngland and Prance together

To the Editor of the Herald.
Sm,-Havingbeen present at two ef the above concerts,
and viewing with great pleasure Mr. Gassner's great
exertions in tbe cause of charity, I think that it would
not be out place if the patrons and officers of those
institutions which have received help from the above
source, would tender a complimentary return to Mr.
Gaesner and the members of the band. What I would
venture to suggest is that Mr. G. be asked to prepare
a programme and give a concert, the proceeds of
which to be devoted, either in purchasing a testi-
monial, orto be given in some shape or other to Mr.
G. and his brother musicians.
Hoping this will bring the matter under the notice
of those before mentioned,
I am, Sir, yours, &c,

TUESDAY, JANUARY 19, 1875.
We commented, a few days ago, on the fucij
thatr Sir Redmond Barhy had been sworn-in
as ActiDg-Governefvof Victoria almost immedi-
ately upon the departuie of Sir George
Bowen-a fact that in itself, under the eil .
cumstancee which rendered immediate action,
by an Administrator of the Government Impe-
ratively necessary, was in no degree incom-
patible with the existence of a discretionary
right on the part of the Ministry to have
held, under different circumstances, the dormant
commission in abeyance. Later events
have shown still more clearly that the
whole'Question requires, to, be more carefully
looked into, and that contingencies may aribe
which,involve doubt as to whether they have
been adequately (as they have not been ex-
pressly) .forseen and provided for.
- Ihe difficulty in Ifew South Wales arose
from doubts as to whether the telegram from
the Secretary of State, which the Govern-
ment interpreted as 'constructively sanctioning
their arrangements,<,was sufficient to cure tha
omission on the part of the Queen's instruc-
tions or commission to provide expressly for
the absence of the 'Governor during a longer
period than a month without ¿ailing in ai
Acting-Governor to take his place. The
difficulty in Victoria was not as to the
swearing in of Sir Redmond Babiiy. That
was disposed of by the force of circumstances
which left the Ministry but one course to
follow. The difficulty there arose from tho
absence of the Chief Justice (the Acting-Go-
vernor designate) at the time when an Acting
Governor had to be sworn in, and from his
return whilst the duties of the office were being
discharged by the senior Judge, the official
designated by the commission to take the
office if the Chief Justice were ab.ent.
Was Sir W. Stawell, the Chief Justice, to
assume the Acting-Governorship on his return,
or was Sir Redmond Baeiiy, in whom the
powers of Governor were legally vested, to
retain and exercise them ? Doubt was felt
amongst the lawyers as to whether the power*
of the commission under which Sir Redmond
Bakey had been appointed were not exhausted
bj his appointment. These doubts, however,
were overruled. Sir W. Stawell was sworn
in on the 11th, Sir Rldmond Bakry art
ministering the .oaths. And it is said that in
the event of any embarrassment occurring,
a telegram will be sent to London, asking for
[the execution of a fresh commission.
As this is cutting the Gordian knot, instead
of untying it-a process thati may be ver)
¡agreeaole to ,'Ministries tin Victoria, but is
hardly excusable' on constitutional 'principles-~
the difficulty remains still undisposed of. Let
us, then, inquire into its nature more closely,
The Argus describes Sir W. Stawell as
"" assuming "" the administration of the Govern-
ment, But how was it possible for hira to
assumo it ? Did Sir Redmond Barry give it
up, or was it taken from him, or did it pass
from him by the operation of the commission? I
The last supposition is untenable. If Sir
GroROE Bowen had leturned before Sir W.
Stawell, this sort of self-acting transfer i
would certainly have taken place. Sir Red- I
mond Barry having become Acting-Governor
during the Governor's absence only,- the
Goveinor, in viitue of his own commission^
would have resumed his full powers on te
entering the territory of Victoria aB a matter of
course. Sir George Bowen was Governor
before he left, was Governor whilst absent, and
would have been Governor on his return, his
commission having been neither cancelled nur
withdrawn, but simply suspended as to its
operation during his absence. Not so with
Sir W. Stawell. He ""assumed"" the ad-
ministratorship ; he did not resume it, because
it was not his to resume. He had not held it
before. If he had held it before, and had then
left the colony, and if Sir Redmond
Barry had then become administrator
in his place, there would have been
an analogy between the two cases, and Sir
W. Stawell might have claimed, like the
Governor, the right to resume the powers
which by his absence he had become tempo-
rarily incapable of exercising. As it was,
when he reiurned, he returned as Chief Justice,
not as Acting-Governor. He could not become
Acting-Governor till he was Bworn in. He
could only take office by assumption, not
by resumption, as Sir George Bowen
could. Sir George Bowen, on returning,
would have resumed power as Sir George
Bowen in virtue of a personal appointment
by a commission still operative. Sir W.
Stawell could neither reaBon1 nor assume aa
Sir W. Siawell. lie had not been
personally named in any commission. And the
onl} circumstances under which he could have
claimed a right to assume the administratorship
as Chitf Justice-as the official designated to
fill the vacant office-were manifestly when the
office wat, \acant. But was it vacant? ' !
Ai Sir Rj.dmoîsd Barry was not absent on
Sii W. t>TAWH.L's return, and not suffering
Irom incHpucitv, a vurancy could not have
existid unless he had been deprived of the
office or resigned it. But, having taken the
oaths, «ho was.to deprive him of the office had]
lie chocen to hold it, adopting Marsh ii
MacMamon's motto, ""J'y suts;j'y reslc'1'""
He could have held his footing in
the Malakhofi' agnvnst anybody short
of the Secretary of Stnte. The sup;
position, then, is that ho re_igned.(
But will that resignation hold together on'
being shaken ? When Sir George Bowen
left the colon), he did not resign the Gover-I
nort-hip. He simply went away, and left the
office to fall into the hands of the official first
I in rank designated to fill itj' whensoever
'hat official should he duly eworn in J
[ But Sir Redmond Barky did hot go away.]
If he resigned, he resigned and still
remained, able, if not willing, to discharge the
duties of the office. But had he the powei'
thus to resign and remain? He_ was, bo to,
speak, seised of the business of administration,
and had he a right of his own motion to relieve
himself of it, and hand o\er his duties to
another who, bo long as Sir Redmond was
Acting-Governor, was his subordinate ? If Sir¡
George Bowen had resigned he would have'
sent in his resignation to his superior officer,)
the Secretary of State, and have awaited
his reply. Sir Redmond Barry, derivingj
his authority as Acting-Governor from the
same source, could presumably resign it only
in the same manner. Resignation, apart from
supervening incapacity, implies a reference^
to an authority competent to accept or decline«
it. But there was no such authority in Vic-
toria in Sir Redmond Barry's case. He
could not tender his resignation to the j
Ministry, for their status was not superior;
to his own. When once he had been,
s worn in, they were rather under his
authority than he under theirs. He could not
tender it to Sir W. Stawell, of whom
as defacto Governor, whilst Sir W. Stawell,
was only Chief Justice, he took precedence.'
On the whole, the theory of resignation seems
as little tenable as that of transfer by the mere
force of the commission, which, if our reasoning
be correct, could only have taken place if Sir1
W. Stawell had been the Acting-Governor,
first sworn in, and had returned after a tem-*
porary absence, during which Sir Redmond i
Barry had been his hourn (mens. A j
vacancy might have been created readily]
erpugh, ifSir Redmond Barry, who is now I
in New South Wales, had arranged for an'
earlier i isit, and quitted Victoria the day before '
Sir W. Stawell's arrival, or if the Govern-
ment had delayed swearing in Sir W.
Stawell until after his departure. But he
remained, and the question is, how while he
remained could the office become legally
vacant ? '
It appears to ,us that, just as it was only
though the absence of Sir W. 'Stawell
when an Acting-G o vernon ,was required, that
Sir Redmond Barry obtained the office, bo,
when Sir'Redmond Barry had once obtained
it and been duly sworn in, it was only by his
departure from t the colony, or by supervening
incapacity, that Sir W. Stawell could rightly
assume it. ' Sir Redmond Barry became
Acting-Governor because the swearing
in of an Acting-Governor was requirod
by , the public interest. But no such
necessity aroBe. on the return of Sir
W. Stawell, because the office had been
filled and itB duties were being discharged' in
the manner provided hy the Royal Instructions
und Commission. The provisions of the Com-
mission and the Instructions were intended to
show how a vacant office was to be filled, and
not, when the office had been duly filled, to
create a vacancy in order to substitute another
officer for the one in whom the powers attach-
ing to the position legally vested.
\ Wir at a mine of wealth there would be in the
\inej aids of Australia if only we had a market
I under our lee, such as France has in Europe.
I'the day may come perhaps when in America,
¡if not in Europe,, Australian wines maybe a
popular drink, but at the present time the costs
'of production and carriage aVe against us, and
dhe reputation 'of our vineyards and wine
icellsrs is not high enough, and in the main the
! market for Australian wines is still in Aus-
tralia. *
j As some compensation for the disasters it has
'latelv undergone, France was last year blessed
with an unusually splendid vintage. Notwith-
standing the oidium, notwithstanding the
¡phjlloxera, and notwithstanding hailstorms,
'the vintage was productiv e to an extent which
has only once been equalled, and that was in
¡the year 18G9. The produce is estimated at
170,000,000 of hectolitres, and sr a hectojitre ;s
Twentr-two-1-4 gallons,"" ttíiB'Ms ""s equal1'* to'
1,540,000,000 gallons. The growth of
the trade out of which France makes
so much money will be visible by |
noticing tViat in 1854, that is only twenty years
ago, the product was only eleven millions of
hectolitres; in tho following year it rose to
fifteen; during the eleven years from 1863 to
1878 inclusive, it rose to an average of fifty
three millions ; ""but in 1873, which was a very
bad j ear, it dropped to thirty-six millions, and
now, in the following year, it is very nearly
double, hating risen to seventy millions.
There are only ten departments in France
which produce no wine, and the vine covers
4} per cent, of the whole surface of the
country, or in round numbers about five million
acres. There are, however, three chief wine-
growing districts, namely the Bordelais, Bur-
gundy, and Champagne, and the produce from
those districts has not yet been rivalled by any
other part of the world. The number of
people employed in thia industry is in propor-
tion to the acreage covered, for it is reckoned
to give occupation to no fewer than seven
million labourers ; that is to say, one industry
in .France alone, and that an industry which
produces an article of luxury, finds wages for
more than three times the whole population of
Australasia. '
Nor is there any fear at present of France
over-producing. There is an indefinite market
for all the good wine that is made, although it
is possible that a great or sudden glut might to
some extent lower the price, in order to allow
.-?ales to be effected rapidly. But in its wine
Fiance has an article which tbe world
eagerly buys ; and, as the world is grow-
ing richer every year, and becoming more
and more luxurious, there is more and
more eager demand for wines of the' best
quality. In this way, France is taxing the
whole world to help it to pay its debts ; and
everyone who sips his claret or his champagne
assists towards the pa} ment of that satisfaction'
which Bismarck and Von Moltkk exacted. <
It is impossible not to notice in this yield of
(he French vineyards how much the commerce
of the world has gained by the greater humanity
of modern methods of war. When we read
ancient history, we hear of conqueTorB who
..eemtd insatiable in their revenge, who razed
cities to the ground, and who ploughed up the
cultivated fields and sprinkled them with salt.'
and who seemed never to be able to do enough
lo tatisfy themselves that the people who had
piovoked their wrath should be ruined hope-
lessly. If the samo spirit had animated modern
war-if the Germans, not content with conqu_
luig, had sought only to devastate-if they,
had pulled up the vines and destroyed
the wine-presses, in how different a
situation would France have been! How
heavy would have been the pressure of
the taxation, and how cramped the resources
lo meet that taxation. What numbers would
have been out of employment, and what years
would have been waited by capitalists till vines
could have been replanted and again become
productive ! But, as it was, the German occu-
pation did. not appreciably affect the vintage,
which even, during the disastrous year of thç
war kept up its''average. <** * ,
It is quite true that this more humane pian
mils the conqueror quite as well as it suits* thfct
conquered. The victor takes it out in monej
inptead of having his payment in revenge. lV
Geimany had destroyed the productive industij'
of France, it would have had to content itself
with a far smaller indemnity. The credit of
France would have been too prostrate for it io
have raised the necessary loans with the'
promptness that it did, and Germany i1-'
iewar.de,d for not having destroyed French ¡
vineyards by the receipt of hundreds of million«
of French gold. Doubtless to a Christian
spiiit this mode of reí enge is more satisfactory,
and to the wine-drinkers of the world it is moie
satisfactory also.
It is impossible also in connection with this
subject not to notice how much of the wealth ',
of France is due to it being a producer for the
luxury of the world. In the way of exporting
the necessaries of life it does not do mucn,.
and produces mainly for its own popu-
lation. It exports but little of com' or of
meat ; but with regard to all that comforts the
stomach or adorns the person, France stands
in the first rank of producers. It is the grand
purveyor of luxury, and, in a world that is
getting every year richer and more luxurious,
it does not fail to find a splendid market.
France, though it has no monopoly of the busi-
ness in luxuries, has the undisputed lea-1.
Italy provides many objects of art, and English
manufacturers are improving yearly in tbiii
productions of taste and ingenuity. Still it is to
France that the world turns for models and foi
its choicest objets de luxe; and there seems no
likelihood ' of its pre-eminence in this depart
ment being interfered wi li. The French
manipulators seem to have as great an aptitude
for work of this sort as their soil and climate
have aptitude for a special class of wines. The
commercial position of France in these respects
| brings it wealth, in spite of all its foreign wai s
and its intestine discords, and of the damage in-
evitably done to trade when capital is alarmed
by insecurity and labour is oppressed bj
taxation.

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 137C.
In yesterday's issue avo published a letter of
Mr. CnACKNELi/s on the second cable question.
The letter, as our readers Avili have observed,
although addressed to the Government of this
colony, comes to us by AA'ay of Victoria. On
several occasions during the last, few months
we have been indebted to Victorian sources of
information for the official correspondence of
Noav South ""Wales. Matters Avithheld from
the public by our own Government are com-
municated to the Government of tho neigh
I bouring colony. By that Government they
aro sent to the Press, and in this way, in
regard to the cable question at least, we have
got to know Avhat is going on in ofticial
circles in Ncav South Wales. We are not
aware whether this anomalous state of
things is attributable to too much communi-
cativeness in the one Government or to too
much reserve in the other. It is, however, a
state of things which can scarcely bo said to
bo satisfactory.
Anything that relates to the improvement
of telegraphic communication between these
colonies and the mother-country is just now of
the utmost importance, and if there is any in-
formation in the hands of the Government in
regard to a great question of this lund, the i
people of this colony are, to Bay the least, as
fully entitled to it as the people of Victoria.
We have no wish to contend for the publica-
tion of private documents. A large section of
the correspondence that passes through the
hands of a Government is judiciously with-
held, at least temporarily, from the public.
There are also documents which may be Avisely
sent to the Government of another colony
and as wisely kept from the people of
this colony ; and as to what documents should
be regarded as private and what as public the
Government itself must be the primary judge.
It is not too much, however, to insist that
there should be a proper xinderutanding and a
proper agreement between Governments like
those of Victoria and New South Wales, and
that any departure from the agreement on
either side should be made the subject of
immediate inquiry. We certainly cannot see
anything in Mr. Cracknkll's lost communi-
cations that should necessitate their being
confined to diplomatic circles. But, on the
other hand, such things cannot be claimed
by the public as a right. If these
and other communications have. been
sent to the Government of Victoria as
private documents, the Government of this
colony has sufficient ground to complain of
breaches of courtesy and of trust. If stich
documents are public, and not priA'ate, the
public of the colony to which they aTe sent
ought not to be dependent on Victorian
channels of intelligence for a sight of them.
Under any circumstances, it can hardly be
deemed satisfactory that we should be
dependent upon the Government of another
colony for a knowledge of Avhat is being done
by the agents of this colony to increase the
means of telegraphic communication between
Australia and the rest of the world.
It is certainly matter for congratulation
that Mr. Cracknell is so fully devoting his
leisure time to the task of duplicating the
cable ; and in one point, at least, Mr.
Cracknell's last letter reports material pro-
gress. The letter of Lord Caknahvon,
which reached us a Aveek or two ago, so
far as we were able to understand it, sub-
mitted the cable from Rangoon to Penang as a
question, the settlement of which Avould be
dependent upon the decision of the colonies.
Mr. Cracicnkll tells us that the new cable
I between thes9 two places has actually been
I shipped, and from this we may gather that
I this cable will be laid whether the colonies
| agree to pay the subsidy of £20,000 asked for
I or not. The object of the subsidy named is
the reduction of the rates, and bo far as this
' part of the line is concerned, the colonies will
have to choose between the payment of high
Tates and no subsidy, and the payment of low
rates and a subsidy of £20,000 a year. Tho
Eastern Extension Company has its own in-
terests to consider as well as those of the
colonies, and ic is not improbable that the
1 company have already found out that business
considerations Avili compel tbem to construct
the duplicate cable to Penang whatever the
decision of the colonies may bo. Under any
circumstances we may conclude, that in a
very short time there will be a duplicato cable
between London and Singapore.
The immediate question, ""according to Mr.
| Cracknell, is the -duplicating of the cable
I between Singapore and Banjowangie. This
would remedy the evils of a very defective
1 section between Singapore and Batavia and of
the Java land lines, which ave Avorked by ,
Dutch operators. The distance ia about 1000
mile., and the subsidy risked for is £21,780,
inclusivo of interest and renewal. Mr. Crack
sru, thinks that tlio cabio from Singapore to
Baujowangio should ho arranged for at once,
I and about this there really ought not to be two
opinions. This is a part of the line that
specially concerns the Australian colonies, and
one that no company could bo expected to
establish -without au Australian subsidy
Mr Cuax'Kneli. thinks that a second cable
between Java and Australia is not a matter
of immediato importance, li it is found that
such a cabio is necessary, ho recommeuda
that the duplicate lino should extend from
Baujowangio to North-West; Capo in Weston.
Australia. Tho Eastern Extension Company
offer to construct a second Australian line,
connecting at theso two points, and covering
a distance of about 900 milos, for a subsidy
of £23,220. But Mr. Cäacknklt. think* that
prolonged interruption between Java and Port
Darwin is not likely to occur for flomo time,
and that a Becond lino this side of Java need
not be undertaken for tho next few years.
Wo hopo that tho Conference which is
promised for tho purpose of considering
tho whole question of a second cable will
be of a different opinion. It is
not likely that another interruption in the
Darwin-Banjo wan gie cable would ho as pro-
longed as the one that commenced about eight
mouths ago ; but experience has shown beyond
all question that on greaC couti al lines a
duplicate cabio is absolutely necessary, if
the cable is to bo relied upon for the transac-
tion of business of importance. Should we
content ourselves with one cable, wo may not
have another interruption extending over four
or fivo months for a long time to come; but
tho liability of an interruption for a month, or
even a week, may, under critical circum-
stances, involve risks which aro too serious to
be incurred, A second cable botween London
and nil the principal cities ol' Australia would,
under any ordinary circumstances,, auswer all
commercial and political purposes, but nothing
short of this will suiflco.
From Mr. Chackmet.t/s tole_j;rara we
learn that the Eastern Extension Com-
pany are prepared to lay a second cable
betwoen Singapore and Western Aus-
tralia for a subsidy of £4-""3,0OO. This, it
seems, is submitted as a definite offer, and if
so the question to be decided by these colonie?
is whether this offer shull be accepted or
not. The alternatives which present them-
selves are our lomaining as wo are, with the
inconvenioncies of a single cable, or the adop-
tion of another rouro altogether. Solar as we
are able to gather, the prevailing opinion in
Victoria is in favour of having the second
cable in the direction of the Mauritius or
Ceylon. The duplicating of a cable on the
present line is, however, the course that has
been advocated by the Government of this
colony. Tins course is strongty urged by Mr.
OiiACKNTtLL, whose opinion in matters of this
kind is certainly entitled to respect The same
course ia urged upon tue colonies by the Im-
perial Government, and it is said tn_,t it is not
improbable that that Government will as___t
in subsidizing a second cable between Singa-
pore and Java.
Should the Australian colonies agree to
accept the terms of the Eastern Telegraph
Company, there is no reason why Are
should not have a second cable around the
world in a very few months from the present
date. The non-acceptance of these terms
will, however, lead either to the postpone-
ment of the whole quesltion, or to no
inconsiderable delay iu the settlement of
it. When the duplicate cable reaches Singa-
pore it will be within less than 2000 miles
from the Australian coast. This is the
shortest route for the second cable,, and must
be the least expensive. Objection» may be
raised against our having a Becond cable on
the same route as the fit st, but objjectkms
more formidable may possibly be urged
against any other route that is suggested.
The most natural and the most reasonable
proposition for securing a supply of an
increasingly urgent public want is the one
that is now before the colonies, and it would
be well if some arrangement could b.e made
by which Mr. Cracknell could be kept ia
London until the terms for laying down a
second cable between Singapore and Australia
are actually agreed upon, and the work is
actually begun.
In accordance with the provisions of the
Sydney Corporation Restoration Act, eight
aldermen o£ the city of Sydney-being one
for each ward-will go out of office on the 1st
of December next, and an election will take
place in their respective wards to supply the
vacancies thus occasioned. The aldermen
who go out by eftluxion of time, are, unless
specially disqualified, capable of being re
elected. The present is therefore an exciting
time in aldermanic and municipal circles.
Our readers are aware that the municipal
laws which relate to the city, and the Act
which relates to municipalities generally
throughout the colony, are separate and distinct
statutes. The Act by virtue of Avhich the
affairs of the city are regulated is as remark-
able on account of ita incompleteness as are
the municipal efforts of the city aldermen for(
the want of appreciation of the importance of
the duties which are entrusted to them. At
every election we hear the cry that "" new
blood "" is necessary, and some frosli candidate
u damned with a fatal iiuency,"" comes forward
as a sort of municipal saviour, and promises
reforms without number. Hut after maldug
one or two ineffectual straggles, ho becomes
as tamo as his municipal brethren, whose
principal object appears to bo to fix upon the
treasury chest like so many horse-leeches.
The two grand characteristics of the Sydney
Municipal Council are a magnificent capacity
for borrowing, and a patient endurance under
deficient legislation' and ridiculously light
taxation.
A seat in the City Council has been for years
a sort of procrustean bed on which all alder-
men of more than ordinary mental and moral
stature have been dwarfed to the proportions
of aldermanic mediocrity. It is time that this
condition of things should be changed, and
as another opportunity is now presented to
the ratepayers, we hope that they will have
some regard to the importance of tho
occasion, and return men of sufficient in-
tellect to understand the position in which
the city is placed, and Bufíicienfc inde-
pendence and force of character to make
their influence felt. The city of Sydney
cannot go on much longer without fresh legis-
lation, it needs it quito as much as the sui
urban and country municipalities, and in
regard to the metropolis, of which Sydney is
the contre, we must have a radical change.
Nearly twenty years Lave elapsed since the
City Corporation was restored, and the altera-
tion of circumstances which has taken place
dnriug that timo bus completely altered"" _,_
condition of things. The suburbs have bl«!

city must bo checked, and whon al) tue°muni

to manage and control. It is R mistake to
supposo that auy man will make an efficient
alderman, or ( that the best municipal repr«.
sentatives will be those who promise ""a
liberality which they do not exercise-towards
their own employes. The most objectionable
candidates aro certainly those who have
individual or relative "" axes to grind/' uni
who seek to attain their own ends by 1:0.
Cessions of profuso generosity. It ia desiriblj
that those who a i-f elected to fill the municipal
ofliee, both in Syduoy and the suburbs, should
be men of independent character and vigorous
intellect-who are above log-rolling and the
lowest aldermanio nits ; who will not htmc ia
any power which will scenic to them a few
extra votes-who will not iuvolve the city in
largo expenditure to promoto their own private
interests, but who will endeavour'to carryon
the municipal work on true municipal*
principles, and exercise their influence to
securo tboso r« Conns which are necessarv to
promote uumJeip.'J usefulness, Experience
has already shown that municipalities areno'
to bo trusted with matters affecting the public
health, and that in order to secure an eftlcient
system of dtainage and water supply for the
whoio metropolis, a Metropolitan Board of
Works has become nu absolute necessity.
Municipal duties thereforo will probably, it
no distant chite, be properly brought w_t_in
a much more narrow compass.
A good many theories on municipal ""govern-
ment have been set up by candidates for
municipal honours. We have sometimes heard
| people who aspire to the oflioo of alderman
expatiate at considerable length upon th« sub-
ject ol' loca) taxation generally, us xlioufb,
they were about to be elected to a sxit in the
Legislative Assembly ^ Avheve tiley might hops
to give a vote for the purpose of determiniug
thi* important question. Occasionally casii
dates are eloquent on the subject of the eight«
hour question, in order to conciliate the support
of Corporation labourera and others. Some ate
grear, upon the subject of municipal endow-
ment , not as to the necessity o£ increasing
the c«.lnwment or otherwise, but U9 to the
mode in whioh that endowment ought
to be raised. rliie,> -want pnblicani'
licenses, wine and spirit merchante' licenses,
auctioneers' licenses, the proceeds of the dog
tax, and in addition to all these they want »
special endowment from the public Treasurr
of pound for pound extending over a number
of years. With thinse sources of income, the) Í
are of opinion that they could conduct tin
municipal business with great satisfaction
and financial success. They set forth a pro-
gramme so liberal as to draw forth unlimited
applause. But, after all, their opinions upon
points of this kind are of very small conse-
quence. They cannot give any practical
effect to them as members of the Munici-
pal Council, and the rate-payers will do
well lo remember that they are no*
about to elect men to perform purely
municipal duties, and not to take part
in legislation to amend the municipal law.
We are clearly of opinion that the munici-
palities are entitled to a more liberal endc-iî-'
ment, and that they ought to possess more
perfect and extensive powers of taxation. But
in connection with the present elections we
have to consider, not how we can best secure
an alteration of the law, but how we can best
securo a proper administration of the law
which at present exists. We hope that this
will bo borne in mind by the various rate-
payers, and that they will not give their votes
to mea whom they would not trust in private
life, or to men whose mental capacity and
moral status they hold in contempt.

'Ibis was an application for new trial on tho ground
that, lho damages aw arded to the plaintiff were excessive.
HÍB Honor refused tho application bocauso the question of
damages had been left to tho Judge and determined by him
at tho trial. Mr. Pilcher appeared in support of the
application, and Mr. S. C. Brown opposed it.
HAM.SDON V. OAKMNEU.
This also was an application for now trial, made on
behalf of tho defendant, against whom a judgment had
been obtained on an order for tho payment of £30 tnado by
him in favour of ono O'Brien. Tho ground of tho applica-
tion was that the order was not an oidor in which tho
defendant promised to pay any amount. For tho pkintiff
it was contended that defendant's order'was a guarantee for
(ho perfommncoof a contract taken by O' Brien from the Cor-
poration. Tho aflidavit of one of the' professional gontlomon
engaged in tho caso slated that tho Judgo had held thnt
the order was a good and valid dooumont in law, and that
that was the ground of the decision. With respect to tho
| order, his Honor held a different opinion, and a new trial
must thcroforo bo granted. Mr. Gannon appeared in sup-
port of the application, and Mr. G. C. Davis opposed it.
îiAvrs v. iionoiiGir OP PADDINGTON.
The plaintiff in this caso h id been tho Council clerk to
tho borough of Paddington, and ho now sued the defendant
for wrongful dismissal. He claimed £160 damages. Mr.
Pigott appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. S. C. Brown for
tho defendant. The agreemont undor which the plaintiff
served tho Council provided that the engagement
might be terminated by cithor party on a
month's notice. Mr. Brown objected that tho
new Municipalities Act conferred oxprosaly upon the
mayor of any borough power to diBmiss any of tho servants
of tho borough, and that it was not competent for the
Court to review the mayor's dotormination in that respect.
His Honor was ef opinion, on the provision cited, that tho
power of suspension was delegated to tho Mayor, and that
the power to dismiss rested with tho Council. He hold
that it was competent for him to review tho dismissal by
tho Council. Tho evidence showed that tho plaintiff was
suspended on the 9th of Juno, and that tho sus-
pension was confirmed by tho Council al its next
meeting, held shortly afterwards. Plaintiff's testimony
shewed that tho mayor of tho borough (Mr. Taylor) told
him that ho only suspended him because ho was askod_ to
do so ; Taylor admitted that ho had no fault to find with
him, and spoke highly of his efficiency, Messrs. Penfold
and Peate, aldermen of tho borough, gave evidence to the
effect that tho plaintiff had at all tunes performed tho duties
of his office in tho most efficient and satisfactory manner ;
while, on tho other hand, Aldermen Humphrey and Stone
states that tho plaintiff had inaccurately kopt the minutes,
withheld certain vouchers, whereby tho borough lost tho
Government endowment for tho half-year-that he had
diEobcyed orders, and had been disrespectful to tho Mayor,
in practically calling him a liar on the occasion of a public
meeting, and again at a meeting of tho Council. Theso
allegations were contradicted by the plaintiff. Tho minutes
of Council contained no record of the cause of plaintiff's
dismissal, and tho only evidence on this point was in tho
vorbal report of the mayor, who thon stated
that he had suspended the plaintiff because his
conduct was distasteful to a majority of tho
aldermen, and because he bad no confidence in him.
Mr, Taylor (the mayor of tho borough) sworo that ho did
sot dismiss Davis in consequence of any ill feeling, but
simply becauso on ono or two occasions Mr. Davis had
asserted that he (witness) was a liar, and that Davis had on
more than one occasion altered things in the account-books
in opposition to his (tho mayor's) instructions. Ho was of
opinion that Davis was out of his mind at times. [At this
Btagc of tho caBc, his Honor intimated ho was of opinion
that plaintiff had been wrongfully dismissed ; that
if there had not been any ill-feeling in exist-
ence, plaintiff would never havo been dismissed.]
Mr. Brown «intended that tho mayor of a municipality
had the power to suspend a clerk or servant, at any time,
who in his opinion was guilty of misconduct; such suspen-
sion, of courso, would bo subject to csnfirmation by tho
Council. In this instance, tho Council had confirmed tho
suspension, that Davis had no right, boing a servant of tho
Council, to have attended any public meeting of tho rate-
payers, and; that Davis, having charged the mayor with
telling falsehoods was quito sufficient cause for his dismis-
sion. Tho utmost that could bo claimed by tho
plaintiff was,"" a month's pay. Mr. Pigott con-
tended that plaintiff was entitled to a year's
salary, tho contract having been for that period.
His Honor was of opinion that he had jurisdiction to
consider the question whether tho plaintiff hod been
wrongfully dismissed. He did not think that it was evor
the intention of the Legislature that the Council clerk
should be entirely at the meicy of tho Council, and should
be deprived of all resort to a Court of law. As a matter i
of fact, he was of opinion that tho defendant had been
wrongfully dismissed by the Council. He was disposed to
think that the plaintiff had shown a spirit of |
par'ialify, and had been guilty of conduct
which was unbecoming, and which would havo
justified the defendant in giving him a month's
notice ; but he did not think that that impropriety of con- j
duct was sufficient to justify his summary and absoluto
dismissal. He was of opinion upon the ovidenoe that tho
plaintiff had not been dismissed for misconduct, but becauso
he did not givo satisfaction to a majority of the aldermen.
The contract was for a year¿ and that contract had not
been determined by the notice in writing required to be
given under it. Ho thought that £50 would bo sufficient
to compénsalo tho plaintiff, and ho directed a verdict to bo
entered for that sum.",The Sydney Morning Herald ,"665,119,627,412,795,825,826,828,827,624,353,798,830,827,827,826,833,828,825,828,823,824,826,855,833,791,558,804,837,835,836,840,837,834,837,837,837,834,832,837,834,836,837,836,835,837,835,836,835,834,835,833,835,831,834,834,834,835,830,836,837,835,837,837,837,838,837,835,837,838,838,839,837,838,838,837,837,837,835,839,835,836,837,830,838,835,838,834,839,838,834,837,837,838,839,839,838,860,838,837,860,841,840,843,861,840,839,840,834,838,840,839,839,298",Sat 21 Nov 1868,"6135,6173,6198,6236,6264,6290,6320,6350,6382,6413,6452,6473,6503,6534,6565,6596,6626,6656,6688,6719,6750,6779,6810,6835,198,228,263,289,320,350,382,412,445,477,505,536,567,598,629,659,689,716,751,782,813,844,874,904,934,965,997,1028,1058,1090,1119,1151,1182,1212,1244,1274,1305,1336,1366,1397,1428,1459,1490,1521,1545,1581,1612,1643,1674,1704,1735,1765,1797,1827,1858,1888,1919,1950,1980,2011,2043,2073,2104,2129,2165,2196,2221,2257,2288,2317,2344,2380,2410,2440,2471,2497,2533,2564,2594,2626,2656,2687,2718,2748,2778,2809,2840,2866,2897,2932","1276,1549,1196,1414,1227,1196,1197,1195,1196,1196,1432,1226,1195,1196,1195,1197,1195,1197,1198,1196,1196,1197,1198,1171,2083,2082,2217,2112,2080,2079,2080,2079,2078,2077,2078,2077,2078,2078,2079,2077,2077,2077,2077,2077,2077,2076,2078,2077,2077,2077,2077,2077,2077,2077,2077,2077,2078,2077,2076,2076,2076,2076,2076,2075,2075,2075,2075,2076,2075,2074,2074,2073,2074,2074,2073,2074,2074,2072,2073,2072,2072,2071,2071,2072,2072,2072,2071,2074,2070,2070,2071,2070,2071,2070,2069,2069,2070,2069,2069,2070,2069,2068,2068,2065,2068,2069,2069,2068,2068,2069,2068,2067,2069,2069",13175999,Page 5

Tho Russians are close to Constantinople,
and threaten to occupy the city if the English
fleet enter tate Dardanelles.
The fleet entered yesteiday, despite the '

than English.
Russia, among other terms, demands portion
of Bessarabia, which may involve complica-
tions with Austiia and Roumania.
There is general excitement here. ii

I öi'ORTINO NOTES.
At the request ol a number of members
Mr. R. Grice lia» decided to stand for one of
the vacancies on the V.lt.C. committee, and
hi« nomination was handed in on Tuesday.
Mr. Grice haa previously acted as a com
mitlecman, and lie I as such a wide circle of
friends that hischunce of election is regarded
as a good «ne. Mr. J. C. Walker's nomi-
nation is also in, but Mr. J. C. Howden, who
has been mentioned as u certain candidate,
has not yet been uomiuated, though ho
probably will be in tho course of a day
or two. There are eight vacancies to fill
at the annual meeting of the members on
August 7. The retiring members of the
committee aro Mcsirs. W. If. Croker, C. B.
Fisher, C M. Ll^yd, W. Lonard, S.
Miller, F. Madden, J. Whittingham, and
G. Watson, all of whom, it""is understood,
will offer themselves for rc-clent.ion.
A New Zealand wiitcr thus speaks oí
Launceston and Loyalty, who aro engaged
in the Melbourne Cup : - "" Among the
horse« doing useful work on the Riccarton
course are Launceston and Loyalty. Laun-
ceston, who is a light-fleahcd horse, lojks
in really capital irirn, and, in fact, BO
forward that it would probably not take
many week» to g^t bin fit. Loyalty,
on the other hand, U a particularly
gross colt, and although he lias already
?bown himself to be something out of the
common, I fancy ho will not be seen at hi»
very best until later on in Ids career. He
wi 1, of course, be rjy.ite fit to race next
»pring, but if his legs stand-and they cer-
tainly look a» if they will-he will continue
to improve with age, and hi» best perform-
ances »ill probably be registered when be is
four or five years old.""
Mr. H, K. Falkiner has sold hi» well-per
farmed hone, Hopetoun, who will probably
find hi» way to India. The Bagct Handicap
winner was leased to Mr. S. Miller, with
whom Mr. Falkiner carno to an understand-
ing which permitted of the horse's sale.
Hopetoun is a good little horse up to a cer-
tain weight, and fit and well in India he
should be able to win a few good race».
Hopetoun has been scratched for the two

m iTr e e s~t a r claret.
It has como to our knowledge that a roport hns boon indus-
triously circulated by somo dishonest person to tho effect
that the CLARET, CHABLIS, SAUTERNE, and other
WINES imported and sold by us, with a label bearing the
above mark,,nnd tho name of A. VIGOTJROUS undor
neath, aro composed partly or wholely of colonial winos,
and that tho cases, bottles, &o. aro imported empty ! ! and
filled hero. However ridiculous this may appear to mer-
cantile men, and those possessed of tho modorato amount of
knowledge necessary to enable them to distinguish French
from Australian wines, it may mislead others. Wo will
therefore pay £50 to any person who will givo us such infor-
mation as shall lead to tho conviction for slander of the
originator of this report.

'
THE message of Brigham Young, delivered according
to the Salt Lake iVetci, ""orally, on Monday, Feb-
ruary 22nd, to the Senate and House of Represent-
atives of the State of DeBeret,"" at Salt Lake City,
occupies nearly one and a halt columns of that paper.
We make the following extract :
We have met in the capacity of a State Legislature
with a view to preserve our organisation, and with an
eye to the time when, in the wisdom of God, He will
move upon the minds of Senators and Members of
Congrecs to give us oar legal, national, and legitimate
rights. We wait with patience to see this done.
Perhaps to some it «vould seem unnecessary to keep
up this organisation ; but it is that we may preserve
our identity as a part of the nation that we assemble
annually in this capacity. If the machinery
is kept in order, when the time shall come
for the water to be turned upon it there will
be no difficulty in starting it. It is not so much
to enact laws and to sit in a Legislative capacity that
we now meet, as to recognise our rights ; and in
doing so we do no more than others have done and no
more than is our right to do. If we who live in this
country were disposed to meet in this capacity three
hundred and sixty-five days in the year, it would con-
cern nobody but ourselves, except meddlers and those
who wish to infringe upon the rights of our neighbours.
In a republican government like ours it is our right to
meet as we do to-day. We have the undoubted right
to meet together and consult upon those points,of
governmental affairs that pertain to our future peace,
end to gather the necessary information to enable us
to proceed further in the'duties of life. Whether,lin
the providences of God, we Bhall be admitted aa a
State or not we leave with him. He will do as He
pleaseB ; the hearts of all living are in His hands, and
whattver condition He permits us to live in we shall
accept and conform to. Gentlemen, in coming together
to-day as the representa'ives of Deseret, we have the
proud satisfaction of knowing that we represent a people
capable in every respectif governing and controlling
themselves. We in this country have achieved a
freedom and independence such as are rarely pos-
sessed by any people in these days. We raise our
own bread and eat it ; we make our bridges and
streets and pay fur them ; we erect our public
buildings, develope our resources, sustain our Govern-
ment and officers, and are not in debt. That
which is accumulated as income from taxation is
appropriated for the benefit of the people. We have
no bondB in market for greedy financiers to speculate
in, to prove a cause of embarrassment to ourselves
or a vexation and announce to our children. Our
legislators have been wise enough not to go beyond
their ability, and burden the people with a heavy
indebtedness without having resources to refund the
same. Should we be aelmitted as a State, I look for
the snn.e policy to be pursued ; we shall
not fall into debt, _ but always live within
our mennB. This is the secret of succesB
with men, communities, and nations. Take men
in any capacity whatever, whether singly or
otheiwisc, and you will find that if they live within
their means they will be independent and powerful.
It is so in the case of a single individual, ana it is in-
creased))- so with a community or nation. We, as a
people, have had wisdom enough to perceive and act
upon this. A people or Government rtat will suffer,
itself to get entangled through avarice or other causes,'
and bring upon ita people war and indebtedness, and
then poverty and distress, proves that it is not capable
of exercising the proper lights of government. But a
nation that can maintain peace within i's borders and
with its neighbours, exhibits knowledge, wisdom, and
power that muBt eventually call forth the respect and
admiiation of the world. Thus far we have been able
J .to piestive ourselves from such contingencies. It is
true that war has been made upon us ; but the sword
of indignation has fallen harmless at our feet. Yet
o,ur own .wisdom did not produce this; it was by the
powtr and wisdom of God, which He imparts to those
who live eo as to receive them that they may preserve
themselves. j
ON POVEBTV.-111 informed in political economy,
the poor are worse informed in all matters of domestic
economy. Having scant wages to live upon, they
rarely spend those wages in the most prudent and
profitable wav s. They are too often the prey to their
own perverted tastes, and to the tricksters who trade
upon those tastes. They buy bad food, and cook it
badlj ; their bodies ore dirty,"" their clothes are dirty,
their hcmeB are dirty. Disgusted thereby, and
afflicted by the hopelessness of their condition, it is
almost a tule for them to stifle their feelings in un-
wholesome drink ; and thus they pass, from bad to
woice. Every clergyman, every dector, every one who
knows anything of the dwellings of the poor, can give
us instances. without number of the waste
ar.d unthrift that there abound. People whese
earnings are barely enough, with the strictest
economy, to supply their most pressing needs;
practise no economy at all. Families that
have, perhaps, twelve or fifteen shillings a, week
to subsist on, do not get more than eight or ten
shillings' worth of actual subsistence. The rest is
squandered foolishly or viciously. For this the poor
themselves are very little to blame, How can they
be expected to do better when they have never been
taught, when their cares are so overwhelming, when
they have every inducement to despondency and
none to hope ? Yet this is surely a matter in which
charitable persons, charitable women especially, might
exercise their charity with unspeakable advantage.
Much they do ; but very much more has to be done
befe re any important change can be wrought in the
eccnomic habits of our mulions of poor. So muoh
that any thorough reformation must be despaired of,
unlees another branch of education-in correction of
the third sort of ignorance here to be alluded
to, and the most ruinous of all-is also zealously
promoted. No great improvement in the con-
dition and prospects of the poor can be hoped tor
until they are taught to exercise ordinary prudence
in limiting the size of their families in accordance
with their means of decently and healthily maintain-
ing those families. Tbis ÍB not the occasion for dis-
cussing the general question of Malfhusianism, as it
is called. The great law of population, first enunciated
by the Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus in 1798-that
whilst, in the most favourable circumstances, the
food-producing powers of land can only he expected
to increase in an arithmetical ratio, population always
Ur.ds to incieaeo in a geometrioal ratio; and that
accordingly, unleBB the area of population can be
adequately extended, its proper growth U inevitably
restricted by famine, plague, war, and other in-
voluntary checks, if not by voluntary checks
resorted to by man himself-is SB simple and
ir controveí tibie as the Newtonian law of gravition.
At any rate, though many have ridiculed
it, and many more haTe ignored it, no one has
ever seriously attempted to controvert it. Multitudes
have rejeced it without consenting to reason upon it;
but all of the few who have reasonably considered it,
have been ferced to adopt it. The precise bearings of
the law and its detailed applications, however, include
many problems that have yet to be settled. We do
not vet know how rnanv inhabitants our own country,
for instance, can be fairly expected to maintain in
that measure of comfort which all human beings haye
a right to claim ; nor have the possibility and ex-
pedience of drafting off to other and thinly peopled
districts those of our offspring for whom there is no
room in. the me ther country, been properly taken
account of; nor have the special means by which the
law shall be ec forced been dulv investigated and
defined. These questions and others like them are
worihy of careful consideration, and will have to be
considered before long. But we need not, and may
Ineit, wait for that time before recognising the force of
trc law in its relation to the present state of the poor. I

BALANCE OF-THE ANIMAL AND VEOBTAHLE KINODOMS
IN AK AQUARIUM.-In Chamber ft Miscellany we find
the following :- In remarking .upon the result;
of his experiments, Mr. Warrington observes, "" Thus
we have that admirable balance sustained between the
animal and vegetable kingdoms, and that in a liquid
element. The fish, in ita respiration, consumes the
oxygen held in solution by the water as atmospheric
air, furnishes carbonic acid, feeds on the insects and
ycung snails, and excretes material well adapted as a
rich food to the plant, and well fitted for its luxuriant;
growth. The plant, by its respiration, consumes the
carbonic acid produced by the fish, appropriating the
carbon to the construction of ita tissues and fibres«
and liberates the oxygen in its gaseous state to sustain
the healthy functions of the animal life; at the same
time that it feeds on the rejected matter, which has
fulfilled its purposes in the nourishment of the _ fish
and snail, end preserves the water constantly in a
clean and healthy'condition. While the slimy snail,
finding its proper nutriment in the decomposing
vegetoble matter and minute confervoid growth, pre-
vents their accumulation by removing them ; and by
its vital powers"" converts what would otherwise act as
a poison into a rich and fruitful nutriment, again to
constitute a pabulum for the vegetable growth, while
it also acts the important.- part of a purveyor to its
finny neighbours."" This perfect adjustment in the
economy of the animal and vegetable kingdoms,
whereby the vital functions of each are permanently
maintained, is one of the most beautiful phenomena
ef organic nature. In the marine aquarium, the pre-
sence of molluscs is as necessary as in the fresh-water
aquarium, to prevent an excessive growth of con
fen a.-, which otherwise soon make the water turbid
witn their innumerable green seeds or spores, and
obscure the glass by establishing themselves upon it
in vast colonies. The common periwinkle, topshell,
and limpet are very suitable for this purpose.
TUB New York Tribune uses the tallest language in
reporting the ceremony of the 4th instant. Mr.
Lincoln's words are recalled as "" beautiful and elo-
quent,"" and "" the sad spectacle of a drunken Vice
President"" is flung at the back of the out-going
Chief Magistrate. There is not much exaggeration in
this ; indeed, it is not until the Tribune reporter
arrived in the ball room of the Waite House that he
wiitCB "" high falutin."" Then, possibly the united
effect of the scene and champagne induced him to pen
the following rapturous description of the Inaugural
Ball:-""Thebrilliant scene presented within and with-
out the building, radiant in colour, glowing with light,
brilliant like tropical flowers or the plumage of hum-
ming birds, and ever shifting and varying like a many
hued and constantly-changing kaleidoscope. Fahr faces,
lovely forms, penetrant perfumes diffused as the
brilliant robes moved about their wearers ; distin-
guished men, bearing names renowned in war, states
manship, letters, and the other activities of our
crowding life, clothed in the martial uniform, wearing
the orders and diplomatic insignia of their own
sovereignties, or, better still, in the simple if sombro
dress of the American citizen ; all these and much
more met and mingled here. Great waves of music
puh-ated along the heated and perfumed atmosphere,
and the witching mazes of the dance, and the moro
bewitching forms of the dancers-the ladies of coursa
-with all the brilliancy and beauty of colour and
fe rm, made up a scene worthy of pencil or pen*, yet
both must fail in any attempt to render it fitly.""
POSITION OF THE WAK MINISTER.-The Royal
Older which defines the relation of the Commander-
in-Chief to the Queen, the Army, and the War Office^
was published on Saturday. Now that it has been
biought to light, the discovery of the Sangraal should
not be despaired of. Member after member of the
House of Commons has gone in search of it, blun-
dered, gone far astray, lost himself, and then re-
turned to sit down in dumb resignation. The jealousy
with which its official guardians kept their secret, and
their blank complacent look while the representatives
of the public were stumbling about in the dark after
it, vveie admirable in their way, but they are now
things of the paBt. The Order has become
a public document, and now that it is
submitted to the judgment of the country we
expect to hear no more of the dispute whether ^4
the Army is or is not under a dual government.
The Roj al Order, which is dated Balmoral, October,
1861-five years after the Duke of Cambridge had
been appointed to the chief command-defines the
position of his Rojal Highness in no mere incidental
mssner. The purpose for which it was framed is
declared to be ""to prevent any doubts as to the
powers and duties of the Commander-in-Chief.""
The Order does not, however, set forth what those
powers and duties are, but after staling to what
they relate-the government of the Army and the
administration of military affairs-it directs that
"" they ßhall be excepted from the Department of
the Secretary of State for War."" A second para-
graph of the Order completes the purpose of the
tim, by strictly appropriating to the Commander
in-Chief all the powers and business relating to the
matters - aforementioned. The latter are ""to be
deemed to belong to hiß office,"" and to be ad
mini&teied, ""subject to our (the Royal) general
control over the government of the Army, and to the
responsibility of the Secretary of State."" Responsi-
bility for what ? Of course not for the act of the
Commander-in-Chief, whose powers and duties are
excepted from the Department of the Secretary of
State for War, but, as the* Order further explains,
"" for the exercise of our Royal prerogative in that -
behalf, and subject to any powers formerly exercised
by the Secretary at War. No words could more
plainly mark out the position of a great and in-
dependent e fficer of the State, who has the power of a
Minister without a Minister's responsibility. We do
not now ask whether this is an objectionable arrange-
ment, or the best that could be made ; we are only
'calling attention to the evidence of the fact. The
meaning and intention of the Older are beyond
doubt, and so far BB they go they are in derogation
of the principle of responsible government which
Englishmen are sSipposed to value highly.-Daily
Neus.
THE DECAY 01 THE HOUSE OI COMMONS.
It is very unsatisfactory to find that before the new
Houses of Parliament have been fully completed, they
are actually decaying in parts ; and the same esti-
mates include votes for the building itself, and for the
appliances to arrest the progress of destruction. The
stone of which it is constructed was taken from a
Yorks!: ire quarry on the recommendation of a com-
mission appointed to inquire into the subject, but
almost immediately after being placed in position, this
particular stone began to shew signB of decay. The
facade of the building was marked by large patches,
and the Gothic tracery of the architecture was sadly
disfigured. So far back as 1857 various processes for
preserving the stone were tried on different parts of the
building, and subsequently Professor Faraday and Sir
Roderick Murchison were requested to give their opin-
ions on the relative merits of such methods. They con-
curred in awarding the pre-eminence to the process
of M. Szerelmy, of which the particulars are, of
course, a secret. Professor Faraday, in his report,
said that so far as a judgment could be formed upon
two years' experience, he believed that the process
would sustain its character for a lengthened period, of
time. '' I do not find,"" said the learned professor,
""in other parts of the building,"" where M. Szerelmy'»
application is more than two years old, any signs of
exfoliation, or defection of the prepared face of the
stone, or any grounds for fear in that respect."" The
process has been applied with equal success to the
iron of the roof, which was deteriorating at an equally
rapid rate. Part of it had been coated with »ino or
galvanized iron. This had scarcely been fixed when
it showed signs of preihature oxydation. M.
Szerelmy's preparation was applied to one of the
affected parts, and also to the gilding of the clock
tower. On a careful examination last year, it was
found that the portion treated with the preservative
material was perfectly sound, while the rest of the roof
had suffered more or less from atmospheric influences.
The First Commissioner of Works has accordingly
directed that the remainder of the roof should be
covered with the composition. Meanwhile the stone-
work shews signs of disintegration, and there is som«
ground for the anticipation that, so far as external ap-
pearances are concerned, the new Palace at West-
minster will shortly look as ancient as the venerable
Abbey, which reckons as many centuries as Sir
Charles Barry's costly building can reckon years,
M. Szerelmy's process is capable of application to
many kinds of building materials. Experiments have
been tried on stone, brick, iron railings, and timber,
with very gratifying results. Pieces of timber coated '
with the preparation have been sunk for two year» in
he water at Portsmouth, and are now perfectly sound.
Textile fabrics are also rendered waterproof and in-
destructible by it.

one end forego the prize. "" Cheek ! "" That's short
and sharp enough, and in Mr. Paul'« case more or
less appropriate-which cannot be said of all titles.

dillon of affairs ? It was a pions princess, St. Helena-the ,
mother of tho Emperor Constantine-*who at tho commence-
ment of the fourth century caused the Pagan templo built
above the grotto of.the Holy Sepulchre tobo demolished,
and on tho samo spot raised for tho first timo the sanctuary
destined to cover the tomb of Jesus Christ. Why should
not tho princesses of all Christian countries, animating
themselves with this glorious memory, como to an agree-
ment to carry'out at last, under conditions worthy of
themselves and of Christianity, tho work in which tho
(tim I« of diplomacy havo not hitherto boon ablo to succeed ?
Who would refuse to listen to their voice, when, placing
themselves boyond tho region of politics, strangers to all
contentious, ideas, thoy would speak in tho name of pioty
and of Christian charity, and would address an appeal to
iho fuithful throughout tho wholo world, on a, subject which
ought to bo cquallv dear to all> But, in order that tho
work should completely respond to tlio spirit of Christian
conciliation which has inspired it, tho simple reconstruction
of the domo should not bo tho only object aimed at. Tt
would be advisable, alter having obtained tho consont of
tho Sublimo Porte, to entirely rebuild tho Church of tho
liol} Sopulchro on n now plon, and on a larger scalo, so
that it might alford accommodation for all communions.
Thus, for example, there should bo on one side a chapel,
and even a navo, consecrated to tho uso of the Latins, and
on (ho other a navo and a chapel rosorvod for the ubo
of tlio Greeks. Tho principal navo should be open to all,
and (ho, access of tho_ faithful to tho Holy Sopulohro, at
present eo diiliuilt, giving rise to frcquont disturbances,
would be freed fiom all hindrances. Tlio majesty of tho
new ponctuai y should as much as pOssiblo equal that of
the snered associations which uro' rccallod by thoso sacred
place«. For theo reasons a competition might bo oponed,
m-which tho architects and artists of-all countries should
be invited lo toko part, and an international jury might
I select from among the designs sent by them that vvluch, in
a purely nrtjstic pouit of view, might bo deemed tho most
worthy of so great an idea. As io tho funds necessary for
commencing and comploting without delay tho new Clrarch
of the Holy Sepulchre, thoy coiüd bo-furnished by a uni-

that the CLARET, CHABLIS, SAUTERNE, and other

above mark,,nnd tho name of A. VIGOTJROUS undor

Mr bAMUEL thought that, after tto discussion whioh
took place on tho previous night, it was unnooossary for
him to detain tho committeo with ai y remarks beyond
saying that the Government, boforo undertaking thoso
worl s, would well oonsidcr their cost, and would endeavour
to carry them out in as înoxponeivo a wnj aB it waB possiblo
to do, having n duo regard to their bomg permanent, nnd of
a character tuitablo to tho colony
Mr WILSON wished to know why tho Government
had como to tho cenalueion that thd railway should bo ox
ttndcd to Yass, and whether m coming to Buoh a conclu-
sion thoy had been guided by the advicoof thoso sciontulc
' (lieera whom tho Government wiro bound to consult m

Mr SUTHERLAND eaid the estimate Aad baon nub

Sir JAMES MARTIN enid ho could not imagino for a

carrving this vote It so happouod thnt on tho previous
evining tho Houso was not afiordod an opportunity of ex-
pressing its opinion on tho proposal originally submitted to
it, Tho roport of tho committeo waB brought up, and a
motion was made that tho recommendations contninod in
thnt rinorl Bhould bo ndopted. J ho Houso had not pro-
nounced its opinion on the matter. Ho gathered from
what wns taid in tho courso of tho dobato by mimbors of
the Government, thal tbey at this moment woro not in a

locomotives and trucks, when nil the ndvintigcs of railwvy
communication could bo secured bj narrow lines with light
echini B and other miling stock, it waa timo tho Government
paused lo deliberately consider tho question. Tho fact was
before them that tho Russiun Government somo joara ago
cunmcnccd a railway from TeBtiniog to Portmadoo, a
distanco of \¿\ miles, at a cost of something like £2000 por
mile This lino, ho obsorvod, had originally been com-
ún need at great cost, but upon the recoinmeudation of nn
English engineer-Mr. Fairlie-tho Russian Goiernment
stoiped the works morder to mnkcinquiries into tho ex-
penditure necessary for tho construction of nnrrow gaugo
railwnjB. Iho result was that the roBt of ihn line was not
onlv constructed with a nnrrow gnuge, but twolvo miles
which bad nlrondy been laid down wis taken up The
Russian Government also sent BODIO of its most ominent
engineers to inquire into tho matter, who j unod with
D nmiirk, Trance, Germany, and England in experiments
to test the value of the narrow guage sjstom If wo
could construct railways at a cost of £2000 per milo with
ly.Lt engines, carriages, and trucks, the country would bo
much moro inclined to sanotion nn expenditure to carry su""h
a svsttm into tho interior than to sanction a further expen-
diture of £10,000 or £15,000 per mile to go »n with the
prisent extensions If tho result of tho experiments which
had been rondo in Europo was before the Government
thi j would boin a much botter position to say what system
thej intended to ndopt, nnd thoj would bo acting wisely in
withdrawing the cstimnto until such information had
rinched them, He hoped, therefore, that tho Government
Honld net upon such advice, and not ask tho Houso to givo
a decision upon the voto, for ho did not wish tho Houeo to
tolo any step which would reflect upon their policy. Tho
lino of roilwny to whioh he hnd referred was 1 i', miles ia
length, nnd had been in operation for ooiuo years, and had
cost no moro than £5000 por milo including the oxpendi
turo on a tunnel which extended to n distance of 700
ynrdp, a work much moro cxponsivo than the tunnols on
the Bnthui st line
(An hon member "" What is tho state of labour in the
country r ')
Sir JAMES MARTIN said that labour was cheapor
than it wns here, but the cost of land made up for that,
whilo in the colony land WOB much cheaper It was proved
that the cost of tho wenr and tear of our linos aroso froa
tbo enormous weight of the rolling stock. Wo took an
ongino weighing 35 tonB with a vory heavy rolling stock,
while in eomo instances the trafilo was confined to a fow
flooring boards or a few louds of hay, amounting to one or
two tone Iho materials which wero convojed woro, thero
fore, out of all proportion to the truaks, and would not pay
the coat of working The light system of railway of which
be had been spenking would, however, only have n gua^o
of H feet, nnd in the casa of the Uno to which ho hid
particularly called attention, tho lino hud not
on)j been found to answer all requirements, but
hud paid dividends of 29J per cent The
gradients were also something remirkablo, nnd tho curveB
could be travelled over at tolerable speed, and with tho
greatest safety. There woro somo railways in England in
which the narrow gauges wero used, nnd tue same
system hnd been adopted m Trance and other parts of tho
world lhere could be no doubt that m Russia the
Government wero fully alive io tho importance of tho
question because of the groat extent of territory to be
cevered, and therefore tho inv ostigationa which had beon
mudo would bo of very great benefit Wo were now in a
position to take advantage of theBo great experiments, and
tbo Government ehou'd pause until the results wero boforo
them Ho submitted that the Govomment would do well
to hold back the Estimates for a few weeks, so that all tho
available information which could bo obtained was
received
Mr. COWPER admitted that there was a great deal of
truth in the remarks whioh hnd fallen from the hon
member, 1 ut tho proposition of the hon member carno rather
unexpectedly, and had taken the Government by surprise.
Ho was, therefore, not prepared atonce to state what courso
tho Government would pursue, although after a fow
minutes' conference they might amvo at a decision. Ho
would, however, point out that considerable difficulties
would ensue upon the withdrawal of tho estimate, seeing
that thero wero a largo number of workmen and contractors
on the lineB who would havo to be disbanded. Tho Go-
vernment ought to have a reasonable timo to conBidor the
proposition. At the present time his hon colleague, the
Colonial Treasurer, waa collecting soma information as to
tbo works now proceeding, to ascertain how far the worka
had progressed up to the present timo, but at tho present
moment he did not seo any difficulty m the Government
withdrawing tho item, unless bia hon colloAguo suggested
ftomo difficulty of a moro formidable ohnracter He thought
the Gov ernment had committed itsolf to works of a vory ex-
pensive character, which could have been constructed at
one-half tho cost, and tho information ho had gamed of
the working of tho Queensland and other linoB convinced
him of this fact, but he was not propared, without consi-
deration, to accept tho proposition of tho bon mombei for
EaBt Sydney
Mr. BUCHANAN said there wero other objections te
the estimate besides those advanced by the bon. and learned
member for East Sydney. He (Mr Buchanan) objected
to tho great expenditure proposed on the ground of its im-
policy, and he could seo nothing which vi ould prevent the
bankruptcy of the colony if tho présent expenditure of
mt ncv for tho construction of railways wero s inctioned
Ho tfiought, taking the population of Bathurstnnd Orange,
that thero would bo a ruinous Ins» on the outlay , and tho
same might bo said of other districta to whioh it
was proposed to give railwav extension. But ho
thought the objoct in view was tho concilia
tn n of the reprcBontntive8 of thoso districts.
We had also a proposition to construct a railway from
Goulburn to Yass, out of borrowed nionoy, which could
onlv havo the effect of gratifying the cupidity of different
Governments, and result in rum to the colony With tho
financée of the countrj vorging on bankruptcy, it was
monstrous to bring forward such propositions as this Lot
the Government introduco population into this wide
country to develop its expansive resouiccs, and then we
shtuld require railways and be able to pay for them
£241,000 for a railwaj from Bathurst to Orango would bo
nriecoof prepobterous folly, and if any private company
proposed it with their own resources tbey would bo pro«
iiounccd menee Tho receipts would be infinitesimal
Wo had nlrcndy constructed moro railways than the
country required, und having done that we might now
tit on the stool of repentance and look at our empty cir
ruiges running to absoluto seed. Ho would not be a party
to borrowing any moro money. We found tho Govern-
ment remitting taxation for purty purposes, constructing
railways for party purpose», and doing everything to pleaso
everybody and keep themselves m office, and it was high
timo to put a drag upon this sort of thing Our finances
wero in n hornblo state of confusicn, and if tno truth were
known, our expenditure was exceeding our income, and,
metí ad of imposing now taxation, wo woro adopting tho
Îrnctico of borrowing money for every conccivablo purposo.
f these p-oposnls to construct railways between placos
which had ne population wero known in England, they
would lauth the Government to seam, and look upon us as
a parcel of lunatics
bir JAMES MARTIN said, that if we had decided as to
the kind of railways wo should construct, Btill ho could not
givo his support to the construction of theso throe lines.
Ho still retained the opinion that tho propor course to con-
struct a railway m a national point of view was, to take it
to the south, and the Government of whioh ho waa a
member did proposo to take tho lino to Nnrandorn. Rail
w ays wero constructed m the United States, not onlv from
one inhabited place to another, but, in thousands of in-
stances, thoy had been taken to places where thero
was no population, nnd thej wero invariably found
to induco tho Bottlement of population by tho
groat facilities which the raúway gavo to enable
them to got their produce to a markot Ho thought that at

They ought to connect the two lines (Hear, hear ) It
would bo desirable for many purposes-tor tho purposo of
union and federation, which bo believed would ultimately
como about. It would be statesmanlike policy to connect
tho two linos Produce would then como to the nearest
and bcBt market, whether that market wero Sydney
or Melbourno, and it waa a narrow policy
which said they should not connect them.
It was altogothor a narrow and unmistakable polioy to
imoç,iuo that the traffic could bo diverged from the boat
nunket Iho hon and learned member would tako tho
Uno to tho Southern territory becauso ho desired to settle
population m a countrj which could bo cultivated only by
irrigation Surely Bathurst and Orango presented greater
facilities, where there was plenty of rich land which coald
bo cultivated without irrigation In tho neighbourhood of
Orango whoat could be produced varying from twonty to
íorty bushels per aoro, ana thoro wero also rich coppor and
gold mines. Ho maintained that if the polioy wero
adopted of extending the line to tho south, they ought to
om and connect tho two capitals Whenevor thoy
did determine upon a vote for the extension
of railways, ho thought thoy ought to go to
Orango (Laughter and oheers ) But having epokon
to tho Engineer in-Chief in rogurd to tho matter ho did
not think that any grout injury could occruo if this esti-
mule were withdrawn for a timo (Cries of "" Oh, oh."")
If ho thought any injury would ncoruo irom such an
arrangement ho would bo no party to it, and ho would bo
no patty to an extension to tho south, unless thora was an
extension also to the west and to tho north [An hon.
me mber And the east Laughter ] If thero was likely
to bo uny evidence produced to show that sorviceablo linos
could be constructed at loes cost ho thought it would bo
weil to pause, but ho confessed that ho hud some misgiv-
ings in regard to tho courso ho was ab»ut to take This
was a favourable timo for raising monoy in the English
market, and ho would rather that the House gava the
Government tho money, and left it to thom to make all
neccBBary inquirios in regard to the railways to which
roferenco had been made, before making the expenditure.
It was only becauso he thought tho feeling of the House
wus in favour of gaining further inform ic_on that ho gava
win
Mr ONSLOW Baid ho agreed with tho hon and learned
member (Sir James Murtiu) that tho railway to the south
ehould bo extended, but ho was of opinion that it ought to
join tho Melbourno lino If Melbourno took away some e£
our trade we should get something from Viotocia Ha
could not help thinking that this question was nut con-
sidered on national grounds, and that there was a mean
feeling in connection with the matter. If it could be dono
ho ehould like very much to test the sense of the House tut
to what lmo ehould bo constructed first If he wore in
'order ho would like to movo that tho Southern lino bo ex-
tended to Wogga Wugga
Mr LACKEY said such a motton could not now be put
Mr ONSLOW said thero wero a good many members
who had got "" a bndgo agin Ihoir place "" and did not cara
about tho railway going any farther Ho did not think wo
wero rioh enough to oxtend tho thrco linos simultaneously,
but was convinced that if any railway would pay it would
bo the Southern when connected with Melbourne.
Mr WILSON said that a more extraordinary speeoh than
/ that of the Treasurer liBd never been dohvorod by any Min-
ster in that HOUBB. The bon. gentleman seemed to havo
forgotten the hifeh position ho held, and had allowed hu
feeling as member for Orango to overcome the higher duty
which dovolvod upon him of looking after the com-
mercial prosperity of tho colony He (Mr. Wilson) did not
soo why we ehould spend millions of money for the purposo
of benefiting Victoria Viotona made its railway towards
our colony for the purposo of taking away our traffic
Wo had twice the number of sheop thoy had in Victoria,
and jet Victoria exported twice the quantity of Wiol ox
ported fioni this colony He thought it was our duty ta
top the Murrumbidgco with tho view of restoring that
tnielo Tho fact of tho matter was thiB, tho pafls°ngor
traffic for manj years to como, witn our sparse population,
would not malo our roilwaja pay Wo muBtlook to tho
carnago of wool and other produce to make them pay.
Another argument usad by tho bon Treasurer waschet
the two cities of Melbourno and Sydnoy should bo umtoi
for the purposes of defence That was morely a fanciful
idea If any of tho largo Powers wera to land in this
colcnj, tho assistance which wo Bhould got frota
Melbourne would avail us very little indeod.
Ho waa nslonishod at tho mgumont used by tho
hen Treasurer with respect to tho ad valorem
duties The hon Treasurer stated that if wo earned a raü
wav to the Murrumbidgee, persons in that district would
overlook then own interests, and still continue to trado with
Melbourne Our ad valorem duties wero 6 per cont , tim
ad valorem duties of Victoria wore 10 per cent And wo
were told bj tho Ircasurcr that ho intended to tako off th»
ad valorem duties hero altogether Ho did not beliovo that
persons in the bouthcrn parts of tho colony would bo so
dead to their own interests IIB to continuo to trado with Mel-
bourno under such circumstancas Ho believed that if a
railway was constructed to tho Murrumbidgee the trado of
that district would bo entirely restored to Sydney There
was another point m favour of Sydney, and that was the
superior facilities Bflbrded in our harbour for shipping
ge ods to the facilities afforded at Melbourno The superior
fuulities that Sjdney possessed for shipping was, ho be-
lieved, equal to 100 or 150 miles of railway Ho know that
if a railway was to be constructed to the Murrumbidgee,
nany of tho Melbourno merchante would shift their
quaitcrs to Sydnoy, in order to take advantago of
tho facilities offered m this port for shipping

TO TUE KDITOll OV THE HERALD. ]
I Snt,-As attention is just now prominently d-aw11 to the j
theoretical aspect of this subject, tho remarles I feel tempted,
to make may pivvc at least suggostivc.
Your correspondent "" G. II. C."" has quoted, from a '
document in tho Sydney Observatory, observations of dry
and wet seasons from 1799 to 1864.
Those seasons ai o recoidcd to ""have happened in cycles,
as follows, viz. ;
Wot period, 1799 to 1821 =22 years.
Diy period, 1821 to 1S41 = 20 years.
Wet period, 18-11 to 1804 = 23 years.
Jn all (iel years, divisible into periods approximately of 22 ,
years or 11 years. These periods of li years become .
romai kable when wo consider that the period corresponds
with that of the cycle of maximum and minimum of sun j
spots, which ifl'lljÇ years, and that tho sun spots aro found
to have a surprising effect upon atmospheric currents ; and '
on this subject the ""Year Book of Facts"" for 1875 has
tho following paragraph, quoted fiom tho "" Comptes 1
Rendus "" : - "" The relations between tho solar,
spots, storms at Paris, and tempests in iho North,
Atlantic,-M. Poöy has ? observed Hint the storm 1
at Paris lind Fé'comp coincide (in their maxima),
like the hurricanes ol' tho Antilles, with tho máxima of tho
¡solar spots ; but that North Atlnntic tempeste and g.-ilos
coincide with tho minima of sun spots. The writer tabu- .
lates 10C7 storms at Paris in the period 1785 to 1872, and
310 at Fccomp from 1853 io 1872, also 829 Atlantic gale""
from 1800 to 1888. Tho distribution of the first mentioned
embraces 8 maximum periods of spots, of which 6 agree
. with the maxima of storms. Of 8 maximum periods, 5
' coincide with those of tho spots. Theso results agree witli
! those he obtained- for the hurricanes of the Antilles,
i Considering the difference of the phenomena, . and
1 that of latitude, this agreement points to cosmic
I influence. As regards the North Atlantic tempest«
'and gules, the minimum of instances correspondB tcf
the maximum of spots in 1800, and tho maximum of in-,
stances to the minima of spots in 1867- M. Pocy considera
? that thero nre in the centre of the Atlantic, two systems o£_
tempests-the one produced hy predominance of the Polar'
euncnts and back flow ni the equatorial current to the limit,
of contact between the cold waters and tho hot waterB of
' the Gulf Stream (those aro the winter and European tem-
pests) ; tho others inversely produced at this limit by the
¡piedominanco of the Equatorial current and tho back Dow
¡of tho Polar current (theso aro the truo equinoctial hnrri
' ernies which reach us from tho intertropical region, start
iing from 10' north latitude-}. lho relation bctwoci»
i those two systems of cyclonic perturbations seem«
j to consist ""in the fact that the predominance
¡and energy of the Polar current corresponds to the minima
]nf the spots, while the predonrinunM and energy of the
¡Equatorial current corresponds to tho maxima of spota.""
¡From some unknown causo the sun spots increase and
¡diminish with perfect regularity in number and intensity.
I Their period is 11¿ years.
e Jt may at fust sight bo surprising that a mere spot on
i the sun's disc should be neec mpnnied by-I mav say phonld
j <ausc-violent disturbance of our urmosphere. But surprise'
I will disappear when we remember that a spot on tho sun
' means a burst of llnmo leuol-ing sometimes sixty or eighty
i thousand miles in height, ami that such flames instantly.
Í ¡.fleet the electric state of our ntinosphtTo. ns is shown'by
' tho way in which clcctroiiietrrs nie nfleoted by them.
Now. as it is found that the number and intensity of
j min spots cause a predominance of equatorial or of polar
.'liironts in our aimosphere in B'uince, at I he Antilles, and
1 in the open North Atlantic Ocean, where observations
have been made, it is quito fair, by analogy, to argue that
ihey direct the predominance, of similar eui rents aB over the
world, in places in which the conditions happen to be
favourable to it; and where more likely so than on tho hot
dry continent of Au' tralia, which is surrounded hy ocean ?
It has been amply ascertained, by theory aB well as by
observations, that all main enrrentsin the ocean and in the
ainiûj-pbore are to and from tho eeniator and tho poles, 'the
equatorial currents being, in tho southern hemisphere;
from the north-west, and the pnhir from the south-east.
During tho lost past six months tho weather in New
South AVales has been exceedingly dru, whilst in Victoria
it has been equally wet.
It is worth while considering whether the dry season
horn is not caused by a pred<<minanc o of the equatorial
(north-west) current, and lho wet season of Victoria by a
predominance of the return cuiTent-south-east-from the
poles, and whether that predominan, o is not traceable
indirectly to the state of tho sun's atmosphere as manifested
to us through his '. spot.""
It is quite possible that a limiting boundary between the
currents differently affected may bo caused by the physical
features of tho country - perhaps by certain mountain
ranges. . ,
It might bo also worth inquiring whether a di ought, in
New South AA'alcs is usually nccomptini»d by a wet season
in Yierteria. If it were found so. it wmi'd not necessarily
follow that a wet one here would bo concurrent with a dry
one theie.

Tub ""Wesleyaxs.-The financial district meetings
have this year, according to the published reports,
been of unusual importance. They have had to elect
a ministerial member of the Committee appointed by
the Conference on the subject of Lay Representation.
The following are the mimstei s elected hythe districts,
mentioned :-First London, Rev. R. Roberts ; Second
London, Rev. J. Hargreaves ; Bedford and Northamp-
ton, Rev. J. Clulow ; Kent, Rev. J. Hall ; Norwich,
and Ljnn, Rev. R. M. Willcnx ; Oxford, Rev. J:

Islands, Ilev.W. Lindley ; Devonport, Rev. II. Jones ;
Corn-wall, Rev.W. Andrews ; Exeter,Rev. S.E.Rowe ;
Bristol, Rev. T. Nightingale ; Bath, Rev. J. II. Lord';
Swansea, Rev. E. J. Robinson ; South Walch, Rev.

New castle-upon-Tyne, Rev. F. Grèves; Carlisle,
Rev. G. Alton ; Isle of Man, Rev. II. Graham ; Zet-
land Isles, Rev. T. Horrell. Though elected by the
district meetings, the ministers cannot be looked
upon in every case as strictly representative,
because they did not give a statement ot their views
before their élection.. There was scarcely any dis-
cussion of the subject of lay representation in con-
nexion with these elections ; but theie will be ample
discussion in all the district, meetings in May( next',
when the preparations and decisions of the pommittce?
are laid I'.c-le.ie theui for then considération and vote.
These élections have been held in accordance with
the following résolutions,"" wlïich.were adopted at the
?Inst Conference:-rL "".The Conference w of opinion
'that the tiní'é is appronehhig when a comprehensive
¿ilan should be devised for some direct and adequate
representation ¡ of' the .laity'in, the ¡transaction ot
the business of the Conference, in consistency
'-with the recognised' principles' of our economy
and the provisions of ¿he Poll Deed ; but the
difficulties which present themselves, after much
'deliberation, are so serious that the Conference re-
solves to appoint two committees to further consider
the whole subject, and empoweis the first-named ol'
these two committees to take such counsel as they
may judge expedient on the legal aspects of the
case."" ¡ 2. "" To carn- out the previous resolution,
the Conference appoints a committee of ministers,
consisting of the persons howinafter rained, togethoi
willi cue minister to be chosen by the ¡ninibteis of
each district assembled in the financial district
meetings. This committee shall carefully consider
the whole subject, and lay their report before the
ministers when assembled in the annual district meéV
ings, and before the Conference."" The ministers above
referred to, who are now appointed by the Conference
aro the President, the ex-President, and the
Secretary of the Conference, the Revs. J. Lomas, J.
Farrar, Dr. Stamp, Dr. Osborn, John Rattenbury,
William Arthur, M.A.,' Charles Prest, John Bedford,
Dr. Jobson, Dr. James, George T. Perks, William B.
Pope, Alexander Macaulay, Dr. Rigg, George ""W.
Olver, Marmaduke C. Osborn, T. Bowman Stephen-

M'Cullagh, Samuel H. Tindal, Charles Haydon,
George Bowden, Featherstone Kellett, Joseph Pos
nett, Owen AYatkins, AVilliaiu 0. Simpson,
and Robert N. Young. This ministerial com-
mittee, consisting of ministers appointed by the
Conference and ministers electee! by the finan-
cial district meetings, will meet in London on
Thursday, October 28. Sustentation funds havo been
referred ""to in most of the financial district meetings,
the object of them being to augment the stipends of
ministeis in poor circuits to the sum of £150 per
annum for each married minister. The movement is
progressing in the following districts ¡-Devonport,
Newcastle-on-Tyne, First London, Bristol, Liverpool.
Manchester, Nottingham, Portsmouth, Bolton. In
the Bolton district there is only one circuit giving less
than £150. In the Liverpool district it was reported
that all the stipends were raised to the amount pro-
posed, and that £120 had been sent to the general
fund. The Newcastle district, after meeting all
claims, had sent to the general fund £110. - Steps
are being taken for the formation of sustentation funds
in the following districts :-Cornwall, Leeds, South
AVales, Exeter, &c. Many of the districts have ar-
ranged for special missions to be held in each circuit
during the winter months. A special convention . of
Christian workers has been held in Birmingham, and
one will shortly he held at Leeds. Arrangements are
being made for a large convention of AVcsleyan» in
London,-'¡'he T/'w-ï,
English v. Ammucak Watches. - Sir Edmund
Beckett, a scientific horologist, who is perhaps the
highest English authority upon the subject, in his
work upon "" Watches, Clocks, and Bells,"" says :
""The liability of a watch, like any other piece of
mechanism, to require repair is in the ratio of the
number of separate parts which make up its unity1.
The English watch, with its fusee and chain, ia com-
posed ot (»38 more pieces than the American watch.
Dispense with these G38 additional chances ' of
breakage, and it is easy to infer the superiority 0/
American watches, in this one respeet at least. The
fusee and chain are_ rejected in the Waltham -waWh,
and the direct action of the mainspring adopted,
because the fusee and chain add giearly to the cost of
a watch, and its tendency to injury, and are of'ne)
practical \ alue for good timekeeping. This change is
aelvocated on the ground that there is greater
simplicity of action, less friction in the transmission
of motive power, increased facility for using a lighter
and more uniform spring, and more room for play iii
the other parts of the movements."" In support""of
this view (says the British Trade Jout nal), Sir Edmund
Beckett speaks very favourably of the American
principle of onlitting the chain. After alluding to
what lie calls the mischievous and common accidents
of chain-breaking, and noting the tendency of
adv ¡meed watchmaking to do without, fusee and
chain, he says, "" Accordingly, both) in Switzerland
and America, which are gradually stealing away our
| common watch trade, the fusee and the chain aro
almost univeisally omitted.""

Woolloomooloo, will on thiB occasion, actually (not) break a
solid granite stono with his clenched hand, or bend a bar of
ii on on his naked arm, but with the aid of a little hanky
panky, 'accomplish the feat successfully.

STATE OF THE CHINESE EMPIRE.
(By the Special Correspondent of the Overland China
Mail.)
HANKOW, 5th August, 1862.
THERE is nothing in the present aspect of affairs
which promises the dawning of a more peaceful day
upon this distracted land. Ten long years have
elapsed since the beginning of these commotions;
and, for aught we can see just now, ten or twenty
more are likely to follow ere they subside. Here
dynastic changes, like all other changes, move
on very slowly ; they generally take from twenty to
forty years for their consummation. There are
no reasonable grounds for hoping that this
will be accomplished within a shorter period. China
is what she has ever been—slow, stolid, stagnant;
and it is hardly fair to expect from her, in her dotage,
signs of greater life and vigour than she was wont to
display in the days of her much-vaunted strength. A
well-instructed Chinaman, reviewing the events of
ages gone by, sees nothing strange in all that is
going on around him. He looks upon the decade of
turmoil which has just passed, and anticipates the
coming, too, as inevitable in the history of his nation.
""These things needs be."" Such is his reply to any
remark you may please to make on the judgments
that are now shaking the very foundations of the
empire. In this he is doubtless right. Were it not
for these frequent visitations, China would have sunk
long ere this under the pressure of her accumu-
lated vices. This apparently destructive element
has been the means of preserving the political
and social life of the people from entire extinction.
A Chinaman reasons more philosophically on the sub-
ject than we seem capable of doing. We point to the
present strife, and say, ""That is hell-born."" ""No-
thing of the kind,"" remarks the Chinaman, ""it is only
an expression of the mind of Heaven."" We pro-
nounce it poison ; the Chinaman calls it medicine.
""It will convert your rich and fair country into a
barren heath,"" observes the foreigner. ""No danger,""
rejoins the Chinaman, "" it will only destroy the
weeds ; and when it is all over, we shall ring harvest
home more loudly and heartily than we have done for
the last fifty years.""
Let anyone take Hankow (called by the natives the
"" Centre of the Empire "") for his stand-point, and
calmly survey the surrounding provinces, and he will
have some idea of the extensive disorder which pre-
vails, and of the utter impotence of the central
government to cope with the evil.
Si-Chwan is to the west of us. This, the largest
and one of the finest provinces in the empire, is in a
complete state of anarchy. Shih-tah-kai, one of the
old followers of the "" Celestial King,"" is there with
400,000 men. Li-ta-ta is there at the head of a mil-
lion of men. The capital is reported to have been
taken by him. Li-ta-ta is not connected with either
the Tai-pings or Shih-tah-kai. He is setting up for
himself, and hopes in due time to drive all parties
from the field. Though the number of his men is
doubtless greatly exaggerated, still, to justify the ex-
aggeration, it must be enormous.
Kwei Chow and Yun Nan are also more or less
convulsed.
The news has just arrived at Hankow, that Shih-
tah-kai has passed over into Shen-si with a large
body of men. This is regarded by the natives as a
splendid move on his part. The province is famous for
its great merchants and wealth. The Imperialists
will find it difficult to dislodge him from his mountain
fastnesses, if he is determined to hold them. He has
also taken some places in the north-western parts of
the province of Hupeh.
Honan is to the north of us. This province has
been the prey of the Honan Filchers for many years.
In vain have the Imperialists tried to cope with them.
They aim at nothing but plunder. They take a place,
remain in it as long as it affords them the means of
subsistence, and, when thoroughly exhausted, they
bid it a temporary farewell. The mandarins have
learned this, and act accordingly. Very seldom, or
ever they come into collision. The ""Fathers of the
People"" go out at one gate, and the filchers enter at
another. When the latter retire, the former return, and
resume their places as the loving fathers of the people.
These filchers are the men that defeated the famous
Sun-kuh-ning-sin in several successive engagements
last year, and ravaged the whole of the province of
Shan-tung; they are the men that murdered Messrs.
Holmes and Parker. They are now threatening to
pay a visit to Tien-tsin, and to do with the province
of Chih-li as they have done with those of Shan-tung
and Honan. The natives say that the Tai-pings are
very angels compared with these incarnate demons.
The province of Kiang-su and Che-kiang, and parts
of Ngan-hwei, are in the hands of the Tai-pings.
They have evacuated several places of importance
within the last twelve months. To say that the Im-
perialists have recovered them, would be untrue.
Most of the cities on the banks of the Yang-tse had
become useless, or nearly so, to them. This will
probably account for their giving them up so easily.
Since the foreign powers in China have thrown their
influence on the side of the Imperialists, these cities
have become a source of weakness rather than of
strength to their cause. Thousands of braves have
been passing under their guns in foreign ships, and
they have not dared to put match to powder. All
they could do was to gnash their teeth, shake their
heads, and swear vengeance. Nanking is being closely
besieged again, and there is a rumour that the ""Celes-
tial King "" is thinking seriously of removing his
Capital. Should he do so, he will probably fix on
Hangchow. That the Imperialists, single-handed,
will be able to take Nanking, is out of the question ;
that the chief may think it prudent to leave, from fear
of a visit from the English and French, is possible
enough. It is quite credible that within six months
this noble city will cease to be the capital of the
""Great Peace"" dynasty. What then? Will the re-
bels scatter ? ""Will their power be broken. Will
Taipingdom come to naught ? This is not probable.
Their very existence and future prosperity depend
upon their adopting such a measure. In the interior
they will be at a safe distance from our shot and shell,
and will be able to carry on their aggressive measures
without fear of interference on the part of the outside
nations. The probable result of such a retirement
would be the extension of their operations into the
provinces of Kiang-si, Fuh-kien, and Canton.
""There is a vague rumour that the Yingwang (gen-
erally called the "" Four-eyed Dog "") has been cap-
tured by the Imperialists, or by Miau-pei lin, who
threatens to hand him over to the Imperialists. If
true, the Tai-pings have lost their bravest general.
Like most rumours of the kind, however, it is likely
to turn out false.
At Shanghae and Ningpo, the Tai-pings have
proved themselves to be a foe not quite so despicable
as we had supposed them to have been. In more than
one engagement they have shown considerable pluck ;
and the recapture of Ningpo has cost us more than we
had bargained for. The French have lost an excellent
Admiral, and our noble Admiral has had a very
narrow escape in these engagements. The Tai-pings
seem to hold Ward in great contempt ; and when
alone, they generally show him that, out of Imperialist
soldiers, he can make nothing but Imperialists soldiers.
These fellows are likely enough to hand him over
some fair day. Probably, he would have been in the
safekeeping of his foes long ere this, were it not for
the timely and generous aid of an arm stronger than
his, which has been stretched forth more than once
for his rescue.
Having been sadly beaten whenever they have had
the boldness to dispute the ground with the English
and French openly, the Tai-pings have very wisely
for themselves changed their tactics. They will no
longer meet us face to face; they will exchange no
more powder and shot with us if they can help it ;
but they will hover about us, cut off all supplies,
seize our boats, kidnap our men, and vanish into air
like so many spectres, the moment the attempt is
made to grasp them. Pursue them into the interior,
and they sniff the air, and laugh at your madness ;
return, and you will find them at your heels. This is
a sort of fighting which we shall find desperately hard
to deal with ; and this is on enemy that bids fair to
wear out our patience before the work is half done.
We recovered several cities and towns around Shang-
hae. Not being numerically strong enough to hold them
ourselves, and the Chinese being too craven-hearted
to, do so, they have all been abandoned, and subse-
quently re-occupied by the Taipings. Would that as
much wisdom as courage had been displayed in the
recent measures which had been adopted at Shanghae.
The latter is conspicuous enough—the former is sadly
wanting. In forsaking these captured cities, by
reason of rebel pressure, and thus confessing our in-
ability to accomplish what we had undertaken, we
have lost prestige and much moral power. The rebels
will regard each case as a signal victory ; and the Im-
perialists are beginning to whisper that foreign
generals and admirals are good for nothing, and their
own little better. Then, what an amount of misery
and wretchedness do we heap up for the people by
such measures. Mere compassion for the people who
are the victims of both rebel and imperialist cruelty and
rapacity, ought to deter us from adopting rash,
ill-advised, counsels in the present crisis.
Moreover, we have converted the Taipings into
bitter enemies to all foreigners, without gaining
the slightest personal advantage, or in the slightest
degree ameliorating the condition of others. Before
adopting such measures, the following questions ought
to have been seriously considered, ""Is it right? If
so, is it practicable ? If practicable, would it be
prudent ? Is England prepared seriously to entertain
the thought of the annexation of China ? If so, how
is the difficulty with France and Russia to be over-
come? What provinces shall we take to ourselves,
and what provinces shall be handed over to the other
parties in the field ? These are all fair questions.
But there seems to be a very strong anti-rebel mania
prevailing just now, and a determination to put it
down, come what there may. For this purpose our own
glorious admiral and ward are seen walking abreast to
the battle-field; Chinamen are taught the foreign
mode of warfare ; and our steamers are allowed to
convey Imperialist troops from Hankow to Shanghae.
We believe that the upshot will prove, that blind pas-
sion has been wielding the sceptre of late, and not
calm judgment. If Shanghae is to be defended, why
not do so from the only place where it can be done
effectually. The movements of the rebels can be con-
trolled only from Nanking ; and it is there the
Admiral ought to make his power felt—not by driving
the rebels out, which would be a suicidal course, but
by making the chief feel that his tenure of it depends
upon his faithfulness to his promises. This would cost
us but little, and the thing would be done effectually.
If we wish to see peace restored to the land, then
let us observe the strictest neutrality between the con-
tending parties. It will never be restored by
attempts to put down these movements for a
defunct government. Any interference on our part in
behalf of the Imperialists, will only protract a struggle
which must go on till a dynastic change is effected. It
is absurd to expect the Chinese to bring this about in
any fashion except their own. They will do it in
their own time and way.
And why should we render to the Imperialists the
slightest aid ? We have nothing to hope from them,
but everything to fear. They are not friendly to us,
and for aught we can see now, never will be. They
would drive us into the sea to-morrow if they had the
power. Look at their conduct towards foreigners at
Hankow or Kiukiang. Were it not for foreign
interference, Hankow would have fallen into the
hands of the rebels a year ago. The people
are now returning in large numbers, the native
hongs are springing up with amazing rapidity, and
the place promises to be as flourishing as ever within
two or three years. All this is to be traced to the
presence of foreigners. But, in spite of the good we
have done them, the mandarins seem bent
upon annoying, despising, and cheating us
to the utmost of their power. They in-
duced our representatives to fix upon the most
worthless ground in the place for a British settlement,
and have kept us waiting for it for more than a
twelvemonth. When fixed upon, the value of a lot
in that part of the town would be about three or four
hundred taels ; now they want five thousand
taels. Our boats are stopped here and
there and everywhere along the river, by
petty mandarins, because we won't pay them squeezes.
We are insulted, and not unfrequently molested by
the braves ; and the mandarins declare that they can't
manage them. When asked if they could manage
them were they themselves the victims of such indig-
nities, they reply that the two cases are different.
Not long since, a gentleman was sadly bruised by
these braves, and then taken on board their boat,
where he was made to go through the three prostra-
tions and the nine knocks. The boat was seized, in
consequence, by our authorities, and sent down the
Yangtse in a blaze. A severe argument this! but,
unfortunately, it seems to be the only kind of argu-
ment they are capable of appreciating. Ever since,
the mandarins have been more careful, and the braves
more civil.
We are told, however, that Prince Kung is our
friend. Well, it is the opinion of some, who are not
very bad judges in such matters, that Prince Kung is
playing a double game. One thing is certain, Prince
Kung is either insincere, or a mere cipher in the
Empire. The Mandarins in these parts act in direct
opposition to the letter of his treaty, and his subse-
quent instructions. The case of the Roman Catholic
priests and converts is a conclusive proof of this.
According to the treaty, persons teaching or profess-
ing the Christian religion shall alike be entitled to the
protection of the Chinese authorities ; nor shall any
such, peaceably pursuing their calling, and not offend-
ing against the laws, be persecuted or interfered with.
Prince Kung in the Peking Gazette has been reiterating
these sentiments calling upon the mandarins to treat
the Roman Catholic converts justly and lovingly, and
promising that the clause in which the Roman Catho-
lic religion is proscribed shall be omitted in all future
editions of the Sacred Edict. All this is very good ;
but in these provinces, any petty mandarin seems to
regard the whole as bosh. This must be because they
have a deeper insight into the secret counsels
of Prince Kung than our Minister seems to have, or
because he is powerless in the administration of
affairs.
Not long since, an examination was held at Nan
Chang, the provincial capital of Kiangsi. The Eng-
lish, French, and Russians were the theme. The ex-
amination was concluded by a combined assault on
the Roman Catholic establishment. The life of the
foreign priest was sought, but he managed to escape,
and afterwards to reach Kiu Kiang in safety. This
was done under the immediate notice of the great
officers of government, and, doubtless, with their
tacit consent. Placards have been posted up in
different parts of the province, denouncing our ag-
gressive policy, exposing our excessive barbarism,
and explaining our recent proceedings against the
rebels as an atonement to the government for our past
offences.
In the province of Kwei Chow, a foreign priest, has
just been executed by orders of the local mandarin.
He produced his passport ; but was told that it was a
foreign affair, with which his Excellency had nothing
to do.
In Hunan, a regular system of persecution has been
going on for some time. Chapels have been pulled
down, houses of the converts have been broken into,
and their property confiscated. The mandarins are
either unable or unwilling to do anything in the
matter.
In Peking, the Protestant religion is prohibited. A
medical missionary of large experience and high
standing is there, but he is not allowed to appear in
his compound character. He may heal the sick, but
he must not save souls. A chaplain is there, who
possesses an extensive acquaintance with the Manda-
rin dialect. Whilst requested to preach every Sun-
day to the handful of his fellow-countrymen who re-
side in the capital, he dare not mention these things to
the myriads of heathen who perish for the lack of know-
ledge. It is reported that he is allowed to teach a
dozen or more Tartar youths the English language, on
the condition that they hear nothing from him of
Christ and him crucified. One of our best missionaries,
who by his learning and piety, would do more to raise
the English character in the estimation of the magnets
of Peking than any dozen of common men, has found
it impossible to enter that city as a missionary.
During his fortnight's visit, he might talk to the
people about everything and everybody, except Christ
and his religion.
Whose fault is this? Are these Prince Kung's
doings ? We doubt it, and that for the good reason
that Roman Catholic priests are there, carrying on
their work boldly and openly, without any one dar-
ing to make them afraid. It is difficult to see why
the Chinese government should regard the Roman
Catholic priests with greater favour than the Protes-
tant missionary. There is not the slightest danger of
disturbance being excited by the preaching of the
Gospel in the city. Missionaries have visited
the surrounding towns and cities, and have
found the people remarkably well disposed;
It is not probable that they are different within the
walls of the capital. The odium of this must fall, we
fear, on one nearer to us than Prince Kung. Such a
policy is unjust and ill-advised. It must be given up
sooner or later. Why not at once ? It is high time
this matter should be minutely sifted, and its injustice
thoroughly exposed.
Such is the present aspect of affairs. It is rather
gloomy and discouraging. Let us hope that better
times are coming, and that all these commotions, and
apparently adverse circumstances, will be succeeded
by a brighter day than has ever yet dawned on this
land._
A NEW CONFEDERATE IRON-CLAD. — A corres-
pondent of the Dublin Evening Mail writes as follows:
— ""She can steam from 16 to 18 knots an hour, is
perfectly seaworthy, for all practical purposes in-
vulnerable, and will prove to any vessel she may
encounter as formidable an antagonist as our own
Warrior, the boast of the British navy. This is the
'No. 290,' as to whose whereabouts Federal cruisers
have with reason betrayed such anxiety. It had been
known for some time that a large and powerful iron
vessel was being constructed at the dockyard of
Messrs. Laird, Birkenhead ; but monsters of the deep
are so much the order of the day at that establish-
ment that no one troubled his head much about this
new production, or cared to remark the extra thick-
ness of the plates which were being used. At the
very last moment the Federal authorities seem to have
had their suspicion aroused, for the Tuscarora was
dispatched to keep watch in the neighbourhood of
the dock where she lay, and the southern
coast of Ireland was also strictly guarded
'No. 290,' meanwhile, apprised of all that was going
on, dropped down the river quietly one day, and
steamed out into the bay, nominally for her trial trip,
with a party of ladies and musicians on board. In-
stead, however, of returning to her moorings at Bir-
kenhead, where she would have been kept in durance
vile by the Tuscarora, she quietly landed her pas-
sengers at Holyhead, and proceeded on her voyage,
avoiding the harbours of Cork, Waterford, &c , in the
neighbourhood of which she might have heard of
something not all to her advantage. 'No. 290'
steamed round by Londonderry and Donegal, and was
joined off the west coast of Ireland by the steamer,
which had previously started, having on board the
armament intended for the gigantic Ironsides. Had
she even met the Tuscarora while still unarmed it
was the intention of her captain to try the fortune of
war by running stem on at full speed into her anta-
gonist. It needs no extraordinary powers of discern-
ment to discover what excitement must be caused at
the other side of the Atlantic by the arrival of the
'No. 290.'

(Tram the Correspondent of the New Zealand Herald.)
Raglan, September 25.
From Kawhia we hear of wars and rumours of wars, in-
stigated probably by the desire of the semi-friendly natives
there to be put on rations and receive pay.
Hone Wetero (John Wesley), lato Nativo Magistrate
there, who wan deposed from his office four years ago, for
the abduction of a native woman, tho wife of a sawyer of
the nanio of Wright, has been adding to the interest of
native proceedings at the present time by the commission of
a most brutal murder.
It seems that this lato learned interpreter of the law had,
with a zeal worthy of Mathew Hopkins, condemned an old
Maori woman of ""makutu,"" or witchcraft, and punished
her by his own hands, cutting off her head on the spot.
This may appear to Auckland philo-Maories as something
startling and perhaps out of the way, but to us hero it is
no extraordinary ovent. It is only a few years since two
natives in our own district murdered a man and woman for
the fnme rearen, and cooked a copper Maori ovor their
grave. Much about the samo time, at Kawhia¡ a nativo and
his wife pulled (be heart out of their living child, under tho
impresfcion that the poor infant was bowitched.

Univsbsity endowments are the thorne of much
controversy in the present day. How to with-
draw or distribute them has attraoted more
attention than how to increase them. And this
has necessarily been the case. The worthiest
university corporations in the world are Oxford
and Cambridge, and it ia towards* thom that the
reforming spirit has been chiefly directed. Just
cause of complaint has been afforded by the
manner in which their endowments and benefac-
tions have hitherto been dealt with. Those uni-
versities have assuredly done less, and tb.it in linly
in the wrong direction, tliau they ought to have
done. They have obstinately lagged bohuid the
age ; for in them '"" the dust of antique Time lies
still unswept."" Every eil'urt to liberalise) them lins
been powerfully resisted, and suido>ii has succjdS
crowntd that effort. The To its'question w.wa
I vexed and protracted one, before any semblance
of reason entered the solemn port tis of these
ancient cloisters. But at last even thoir learned
repose was disturbed. Force from without
succeeded in opening wider the gates ot
their places which had so long been
merely close boroughs. Although sown'nwderu
characteristics of English hie Were re-
flected in Oxford and Oainbridgi, they wero
physical rather than mental charaot<¡rtsttcs.
True, the revoit .of progressive intellect w«w ant
unheeded, but it was too weak to obum a victory.
Not a few of Oxford's best scholars loarlussly
assailed her exclasiveuess, and in the hot beds of
Toryism avowed and pr«>pagated the extretnest
Radical views. Her recent poet is as Republbun
as her young political philosophers aro (J imttst.
Yet all thewbile she has assuund au attitude! uf
serene indifference. Her affluent endowments
have too often been diverted to the maintenance
of intelligent laziness, till even now Professor
Huxley illustrâtes the condition of the enriched
sloth she has encouraged. "" ïou know"" (he says
to tho Aberdeen student*) ""that among the beos
it depends on the kind of*cell iu which the egg
is deposited, and the quantity and quality ol
food which is supplied to the grub, whether it
shall turn out a busy little worker or a big idle
queen. And in the human hive, the cells of the
endowed larvas are always tending to enlarge,
and their food to improve, until wo got queen*,
beautiful to behold, but which gather no honey
and build no comb."" This similitude cannot be
unproved upoD.
But it is not with other Universities as with
these old temples of learning. They have too
often Buffered lor lack of the gold required for
bare support. «Some, indeed, have had uo occa-
sion to grumble, yet even they cannot boast of
their excessive riches. The ¡Scottish Universities,
for instance, thrive well, and doubtless would do
so even were they less favourably endowed than
they are, for they possess many Regius professor-
ships, besides other chairs established by private
munificence. Trinity College, Dublin, is in a
position moro akin to the great Euglish Univer-
sities than any other notable seminary of learning
we can mention ; and this is one reason why she
has been so often and bitterly called to account.
But there is another reason for the attack upon
her : she has been jealously regarded by the
Roman Catholics as a citadel of Protestantism,
and not even that excellent compromise, the
Queen's University, could remove this jealousy,
it was denounced at the outset «13 a trinity of
"" godless colleges "" by Sir R. Inglis, when, we
think, he was member for Oxford ; and the Roman
Catholics were too glad of such a cry not to take
it from the lips of an inveterate Episcopalian.
The large annual grant to Maynooth was no balm
to their wounded feelings, and the consequence
has been that not only has Trinity College, Dublin,
been persistently assailed, but the Queen's
University has been unwarrantably maligned and
denounced. Nevertheless, no greater freedom
from « testa . or anything obnoxious to the
feelings and convictions of students of all
religious persuasions can be found than in the
Queen's University, Ireland. And this brings us
to the point whereat the 'question of endowments
bifurcates as applied to Ireland and to England,
and furnishes an unmistakable guide to the
tendencies of the two countries. In England it
is sought to divert a portion of the endowments
of Oxtord and Cambridge to more general uses
to widen their approaches, and to assist more of
those who enter them.L In Ireland, the aim is
directly opposite. There it is desired to «divert
the money in order to erect a more exclusive
college. The grant of a Charter to a Catholic
University must be followed, as we know
from experience, by a substantial dole, or,
more preferably, by a thick slice from the
Trinity cake. The debate in the House of
Commons, fourteen months ago, in which Pro-
fessor Fawcett so ably distinguished himself as
a great authority on University questions, ex-
posed the tactics of the Catholic hierarchy, and
gave-mainly through that exposure-a tresh
lease of life to Dublin University. In Scotland,
lortuuately, University education has .always
been on a liberal basis, and nothing has occurred
to provoke differences or lend couutenance to an
assault on tho endowments. The Established
Church still maintains, certainly, her hold on the
Theological Faculty iu each University, but the
exclusive right of that Church to the Principal
ships or Prolessorships (not theological) has boon
long done away with. We had notable instances
of this in the appointments of Sir David
Brewster and of his successor, Sir Alexander
Grant, as Principals of tho University of Edin-
burgh ; of a Free Church man, Professor Veitch,
1 to the Chair of Logic, and of Mr. Edward Caird,
1 to that of Moral Philosophy in Glasgow Uni-
versity ; and of Dr. Calderwood, a United Pres-
byterian clergyman, to the Professorship of Moral
Philosophy m Edinburgh. This removal of
sectarian supremacy h«u> already dono inestimable
good. Tho Loudon University, on the other
hand, was tho result of revolted and magnificent
effort, and the distinction for liberality and use-
fulness which she sought has already been
achieved. But her case in nowise touches the
question in the light 111 which wo have viewed it.
However, we care les3 for disputes about the
alienation oi endowments aud -the reasons
annexed thereto, than we do about an increase
of them where they ara especially wanted. Wa
have iu our midst a tree of knowledge planted
ir. good soil, but it requires watering and tendiug.
In other words Sydney University, although it
does not languish, is not the object of that sub-
stantial care which ought to be bestowed on it.
This University is not open to any of the objec-
tions applicable to some ot those already passed
in review. Neither obeso endowments nor can-
kering tests afl'«,ct her body. She is the embodi-
ment of the time, saving the wealth which is
looked upon as the sinews.' Such an institution,
indeed, cannot fail to exercise a wiso and
beneficial inlluence on a young ' community ;
and the more attractive it is made the
less ' excuse will remain, for those who sail
to Europo for a University education. Still
it is not to this more afilucnt cl.iss that our ob-
servations will have reference ; it is rather to the
class who cannot afford, and yet lonjr-for, the
highest instruction, and who if enabled to prose-
cute their studies would probably reflect honour
on the country. The mere racej for wealth is
anything but ennobling, and nothing acts so
soothingly on the nation hastening to become
rich, than pervading intelligence and high and
refined culture. It we look at those countries
which in their infancy neglected to take learning
by the hand, we perceive a ruggedness and want
ot pure taste disagreeably remarkable. The com-
mercial enterprise and the advancement of agri-
cultural, pastoral, and mining pursuits are not
retarded, but aided by the spread of higher learn-
ing. The Scotch, who are commonly accounted
a shrewd people, saw this centuries ago, and sup^
ported with comparative profusonesa and energy
their insufficiently endowed colleges; and wa
have only to look at their schools, regarded as
models throughout the world, to witness the
fiuits of -voluntary effort in raising money to
build and endow them. The bursaries, not leas
than the scholarships and prizes, are rich in
number and amount ; and as an instance of the
benefit accruing from one wo may cite the Snell
Exhibition of Glasgow University. That reward
for tcholarahip is given annually in the shape of
£130 ajear for fa ve years to two students who
prticeed to Oxford for that period. Of those thus
aidi d, and most of whom could never have pro-
ceeded thitber without assistance, the names of
Dr. Adam Smith (author of the ""Wealth of
Nations""), Sir William Hamilton, the present Arch-
bishop of Canterbury, and the present Lord Presi-
dent oi ¡Scotland, occur to us among a host of dis
tingiiii-htd nien. Other scholarships, fellowships,
¡um bursaries-many near and up to .£100 per
ai.nuni are conferred on students remaining at
their Universities ; while another class of bursa-
ries, and th.it a very largo one, are given to de
st rvmg j oung men before they go to Uollege at all,
in order to enable them to go there. Their parents
are generally tuo poor to send them, and at their
age they are unable to earn enough to_ support
themselvt-s while there. Heuce the wise previ-
sion and provision made. Many brilliant in-
stances of that kind of timely and substantial
atsistance are to bo found in the colonies, doing
their educated best for their adopted land.
Tho above is but a casual illustration of the
way in which countries when comparatively
poorer than New South Wales dealt with the
growing want of education of the highest class,
and looked to learning as something supremely
deserving of support. Much nonsense has, indeed,
been talked about paying for otheia out of money
made for oneself, and by oneself. Verily, this is
the meanest kind of selfishness. Moreover, it has
been said that "" compulsory education is justified
by the consideration that ignorant people do not
want to be taught,"" but when it is argued from
this that others partly educated do not desire a
University education it is trifling absurdly with
the question. Those who have slaked but not
quenched their thirst for learning may be the
very ones too çoor to pay for another draught ,of
the Pierian spring. Again, the pursuit of Jcnow
ledge under difficulties ia a pet stone to throw 'at
the advocates for assisting students, but would
that knowledge not have been greater and better
as well' as sooner gained, had there been fewerjor
no difficulties 1 All this is sheer begging the
question. The conclusion such people draw
is drawn from the premises of their
pocket. Others may freely think and believe that
there is nothing to object to but r<ither something
piaiseworihy in this giving to the cause of educa
tiau-if others do so. But-agerc considerate
plnris est quam, cogitare jtrudenter. Amerita,
too, furnibhi'S eminent examples of merchants
and others giving quickly ana largely, and it i.s
needles-s to specily where the instaucea are almost
innumerable.
A writer in Frasers Magazine declares that
""if there were not considerable funds devoted' te
the support of the studies which do not itnniodi
;itely lend themselves to utilitarian purpose*, the
studies would be altogether neglectsd."" This is
indisputably true. Our advance in every branch
of science, ;irt, aud industry is bat thought in
action. Leisuie is required to mature any great
project, to perfect any great inveution. If to the
inventive genius of mechanics and non-univer-
sity men wo owe many of the best invention1
and most important discoveries, we owe theil
completion to methodically and highly-trained
University men. We all know thit Watt dis
covered steam» and that Stephenson invented the
cteam-engine, but we must not forget that Profes-
sor Wheatstone and Professor William Thomson
gave us our telegraph system. _ Besides,
scientific inquiry and -the artistic appli-
cation of results can only be made i by
those who have boen specially educated to a
knowledge of the phenomena. We say nothing
here of literature, philosophy, and the fine arts,
which elevate, strengthen, and refine a people, for
it would be quite superfluous to offer any re-
marks thereon to those who appreciate the value
of cultivated taste, and the proper guidance of
intellectual power.
The influence of Sydney University requires,
in our opinion, to be extended, and that is mainly
to be done by amplifying the means at her com-
mand. Her endowments ought to be increased.
She would then be able to take a wider range and
to embrace every section of the community ; for
a University should combine all classes as well
as all studies of paramount utility and of value
in themselves, and from it as a centre should
radiate the ideas that would germinate through
the country. Additional scholarships might be
founded, and inducements held ont to
deserving men to prolong their studies or
continue their scientific investigations in
the University. But this is, alter all, a
consideration"" secondary and auxiliary to the
bringing of the makings of such men to the
University. A number of bursaries sufficient
in money to sustain in the most moderate way
the picked scholars of our leading academies in
town and country, supplemented by other bur-
saries given by private individuals to youthful
aspirants, would go very far indeed to aid the
cause which we have so much at heart. The
condition of granting the latter sort of help would
necessarily be the inability of the student to main-
tain himself, and thus a low rung in the social
ladder -would be reached. There is, moreover,
another reason. Very few poor students can
afford the expense incurred iu the training preli-
minary to a competitive examination-and as it
is, we are no lovers of cram. The system is a
vicious one, for the most part vain even while it
cramps the youthful faculties, further, the
beveral colleges incorporated with Sydney Uni-
versity might easily obtain money enough to
attract one or two scholars each to them, and thus
provide them with college bursaries to the Uiii
versity. The Queenslander are beginning to
t-ee the need and pressure of this Bubject, and
ere long we may see among us a contingent of
their foremost Grammar scholars at the University.
They propose to devote £2000 per annum to the
sending and keeping of these youths-that is,
nearly half the annual endowment originally
granted to Sydney University for buildings,
stipends, scholarships, prizes, ifec. Let us take
the hint.
We aro not going to say anything here against
Parliament on the score of endowments, for we
gladly admit that they have been most liberal
when they believed it to be tbeir duty. What
they have already done is in the highest, degree
praisewoi thy, and he would bo a churl who
i thought otherwise. But as the population
increases, and scientific progress marches at
.double quick time, the, necessity for more
endowed chairs and additional encouragement to
I scholars advances with them.
It is, however, to our chief merchants, miners, I
and landowners that the real urgency of the case |
must be put. They have done much already, for
there aro among our citizens men whose generous
treatment of this difficulty will secure to tht m
the lasting gratitude of the colony. Where so
many have liberally given of their substance I'or
the promotion of learning, it would be invidious to
particularize. Others equally able to afford the
means may well follow the beneficent example
before them, The poorer students must,be thcl:
especial care, although the rewards for industry
and distinction may wisely be multiplied. It
must, nevertheless, ,be remembered that though
prizes may stimulate they cannot feed and clothe
the poorer though perhaps better scholar ; and
either the scholarships for the best competitors at
the matriculation examinations must be largely
increased, or bursaries such as we have suggested
must be given. Professors and teachers will re-
ceive more money the greater the number of'their
pupils, and bo far as they are concerned the ques-
tion necti not be considered further at present.
There Is little fear of our professors or students
fattening on'endowments, or becoming mero lotus
eatiug fellows of one college or another ; little
danger, indeed, of Professor Huxley's reproach
touching us. Over-wealthy endowments can
never exist among us with our experience, but
let them, for all that, be sufficient in number and
amount. The Sydney University has unques-
tionably a'claim on all classes of the community,
and we trust that claim will be readily« speedily,
and substantially recognised.

Adelaide gossip informs us that Miss

Genoral for South Australia, has resolved to
adopt the stage as a profession, and will
make hir debut in Adelaide at an early date.

From the Cape we hear that Lady Con-
stance Lytton has been visiting her aunt,
Lady Loch. At a Cape Town race meet-
ing Ltdy Loch wore a dress of her
favourite grey, the material being fine
casi mere ; the skirt had a foot oorder of
grey silk, and the long bodice was edged to
matali. and faced back with the rame over a
vest of the silk, having a centre of white
beautifully embroidered in gold ; bonnet of
grey chip, trimmed with ribbons same
colour. Lady Constance Ly ton was in a
Íiretty dress of black s tri ned grenadine ;
arge hat of black chip with feathers same
I tone, and a knut of black and white ribbon,
also a spray of white blossoms. The Misse«
Lieh were in palo green erepon, trimmtd
with ribbon velvet ina darker «hade.

Nurses' Home, held at the residence of Mr.

berry tea, and many other similar entertain-

joyable, a large number oí guests assembled
everywhere.
Members of the Ladies' Flower Mission
are very busy collecting cards, toys, cakes,
flowers, and other things either nice, beauti-
ful, or otherwisa interesting, for the

The Salvation Army inaugurates a grand
Christmas festival at the Olympia, Flinders
street, on Friday next, when the opening
ceremony will be performed by Mr«. Snow-
den, Mayoress of Melbourne. The Army
usually gives a good Christmas banquet to
some 700 or 800 persons, besides distributing
supplies to hundreds of families. It is to be
hoped that their funds will embie them to
do the same this year. A number of large
donation« to the Army work have been sent
ia this month.
, _The_death.o£ Captain Rowan, Ensi-Mel
Tiôuruo, was very sudden. It occurred in
this way :-He camu over from Sydney last
week, uud must have caught a cold, which
sp cdily developed pneumonia, and ho died
on the tourth day, The deceased gentleman .
was a cousin of Lady C'arke, uni his wife, '
Mrs. Rowan, floral artist, is a sister of Lady
Charles Sote, hence several leading
families will have to go into mourning.
Wri ing of mourning reminds me of
an aiticlo 1 read recently, in which the
funereal customs of the present day were
strongly condemned. Tho wcariDg of
elabarate mo îrniiig and the pomp and cere-
monies of burials with coaches and hearse
with co Iding plumes and all the parapher
nilia attendant on tho last obsequies were
cctHiired, and in such a manner as to carry
a lurg» measure of conviction to the minds
of thu couvincible reader. Wo are going to
have an extonsivo cicm-itorium somewhere
out of Melbourne ; probably the Frankston
site will bo dtcidcd upon. There is to
be u general cemetery tis well at the
samo plaie, so ptrsuns muy choose
for themselves, whether it Is cremation or
the customary burial. Some of the best
families in Great Bri'aiu hate lecome
members of n society for simplicity in
fuueral arrani/eini nts. Cremation will, no
doubt, eventually simplify matters of this
kind in un extended degnu
People dying tloos not deter other people
from marrying aud giving in marriage, as
witness the long list of bridals fur this

Ono wedding which I like to chronicle ia
that of Mr. Alexutidcr and Miss Mary Hirst
Brown, who has been the social writer for
tho Sun for a considérable period. They
were married at All Runts' Church of Eng-

Wo have received Melbourne Punch
Almanac lor 181)3. and it is a, happy combi-
nation of common sense and drollery, but
wetfuil'to see »hero tho title of almanio
comes in. The pioduction is very superior
ito that issued last year.
Tho 'Antipodean Ina also reichod us. It
is well got up, in good readable type, ' on
'toned 'piper,' and ia fully illustrated hy
likenesses taken from photographs of the
various contributors. Tho.volume is net
meeting with general approval in literary
circles here. Although the poetry is upon
the whole well wntten, Mr. G. E. Evans
and Sir Henry Parkes taking tho lead, Mr.
O'Hare has mail? the most of "" A Dead
Forest."" The veises arc well written, but
the divina infUtus i« wanting ; simply this
and no'bing more. The likeness of Mr.
Davil Blair is excelleat. It is a pity the
dear /old domocrat, in dwelling ou early
political reinin siences, should have taken
up so much spioa in quoting in full a long
Iiish snug. It is to bss hoped that our
friends beyond the seas will nut imagine the
prose contributions up to the Australian
stsndard, fur we have sjoies of story writer«
in each of. the colonies who can do very
much better work. _ i I

AUSTRALIAN POKTKY.-On the subject
of AuBtra'asian poetry a contributor to a
Loudon contemporary writes as follow« :
The (best poetry producer« in Australia
at the present t(ma ara to be found
on the staff uf the Sydney Bulletin) but
it would be nothing short of '< flat bur-
glary "" tn elevate a Bulletin man to the
duuy height of tha Laureateahip. ¡Brontin
Stevens is alive somewhere in Queensland,
it is true, but, as hi« title to poetie fame
seam« to rest principally on his bush
lyrlo about the Chinese cook who served
up kittens to his mailer in lieu of the
more «ucoutent rabbit of the oountry,
hi«1 ohancea would be poor indeed. ¡The
Maoriland poet, Thomas Bracken, is about
the best of his kind in that part of the colo-
nies, while Thomas Honey, of Sydney,
might also be fairly included in a short list
of colonial poets who are on the verge of
being sufficiently qualified. In Canada there
is Archibald Lampman, pai haps tha best of
living colonial poets ; while India could
produce a few respeotable candidates.
None of tbeso-people might be considered
teriously, of course, except far the scanti-
ness of i suitable writers at Horns, When
we have sober papéis putting forward the
pames of buffoons attached to sportiug
papers in London, aud naming long-liaiied,

LONDON, NOVKMBBB 6, 1868.
[WHITTEN EVPRESBI/V ion THE S. M. HEKALII.]
THE great political battle for Parliamentary power
has now fairly commenced, and before a fortnight
has elapsed the country will have emphatically deci-
ded whether the Conservatives or the Liberals are
to be masters of the situation. Everywhere the
canvassing is going on in grim earnest, sometimes,
ae at Blackburn, mingled with fierce rioting and
even bloodshed. The publicans, too, ate playing
their little game. Where they are not being bribed
by the different competing candidates, they are to be
found starting their own man, their logic evidently
being that if the electors choose to make them an in-
fluential class, it is but fair that the influence so ob-
tained should be exerted to the uttermost on behalf
of those possessing it. The new voters do not, as a
rule, see things exactly in this light, hence we have
the curious end significant anomaly of the great mass
of electors being found ranged on one side, and the
unpopular candidates, backed'by the publicans, on the
other. Of course, every possible political and social
topic has now a chance of being discussed. For in-
stance, the Sunday question ÍB continually being
mooted at the different election meetings, but in a very
few places only are the candidates found sufficiently
bold to declare themselves in favour of the opening of
museums and similar places of recreation on Sundays,
so greatly is public opinion divided on the subject.
Very significant is the unmistakable rebuffs which
the working-class candidates are everywhere expe-
riencing. Although want of money may have had
something to do with their general non-success, the
real obstacle with which they have had to contend is
the popular instinct respecting their utter uafitness
for Parliamentary duties. Take, for instance, the
secularist Bradlaugh, who is now struggling to procure
one of the Beats ocrupied by Charles Gilpin and Lord
Henley at Northampton. Suppose for a moment that he
was returned for that busy_ tow n, what possible informa-
tion could he impart to his fellow-members respecting
the social condition and wants of the working class ?
Absolutely nothing. He is a mere clap-trap speaker.
Mere demagogues are out of place in Parliament.
What is really wasted are men whose character and
abilities shall be of the right kind. That the people
can recognise these, even in a political opponent, is
clearly shown by the cordial reception recently
awarded the Marquis of Salisbury at Manchester.
Ten years ago the idea of a Conservative statesman
being feted by the "" Manchester School "" would have
appeared impossible of realisation. Sut this is the
age of anomalies, and therefore we are surprised
at nothing. Yet the event is not with-
out its importance. It seems to be, to
quote the words of an experienced journalist :
"" One of those incidents which to the future historian
of this country will seem to mark a peaceful revolu-
tion in its political and social relations. It looks as if
the barrier'of strangeness and distrust between the
hereditary territorial aristocracy and the democratic
potentates of an industrial epoch, were breaking
down, end that the great principles which have BO
long been the watchwords of an advanced pirty, were
becoming the common property ot public men of all
parties, orders, and degrees, with any pretensions to
statesmanship."" That Mr. Gladstone will have re
sawed the premiership, with a large majority to sup-
port him, by Christmas, seems to be generally
accepted even by the Tories aa an inevitable fact.
Australian interests bid fair to be pretty well repre-
sented in the new Parliament. Colonel Torren» seems
to have a good chance at Cambridge, Mr. M«Arthur
is safe for Lambeth, and of the other half-dozen can-
didates connected in some way or another with Aus-
tralian matters, not one has even the prospect of
failure.
lhe"" death of the Archbishop of Canterbury has
excited considerably less remark than would have
been the case had the event occurred at a time when
the public mind was not so fully occupied with
political matters. The Archbishop was a good and
kind-hearted man, but scarcely fitted for the im-
portant post which he was called upon to hold. The
nonconformist, a journal not much given to speaking
well of the epifcepacy, commenting on the prelate's
decease, remarks that the Archbishop «' died-after <
conducting the Church, of which he waa the nominal ,
head, with at least great judiciousness, through a I
serien of almost unparalleled troubles-a good and
bumble man. Those who Baw him frequently-and
this, at one time, 'was the case with ourselves-and
those ""who knew him intimately, will both say that he
was a Christian gentleman. Be had gTeat suayity of
manser, but he never produced the impression of
being insincere. ""When one comes to think of it this
is a good deal to say for an Archbishop of Canter
bury, for it is a good deal to say of any man, and
more especially of any clergyman, who has risen to
the highest office in the land. Few could wear the
loftiest mitre without showing some spiritual or, at
any rate, some human pride. The late Archbishop
indicated no vice of this kind."" Never was man
placed in a greater dilemma than is Mr. Disraeli at
ihe present moment. Whatever way he may decide,
he is certain .to create for himself a host of enemies
within the Church.
Among the minor and almost unnoticed indications
of social progress in this country is the gradual dis-
appearance of the once familiar turnpike gatea. The
turnpike-road system seems to have been a complete
failure. It was as bad as the French octroi, without
any of its advantages. True, the main roads were
often maintained in pretty good order, but the side
thoroughfares were invariably neglected ; and, how-
ever pleasant might be our green country lanes on a
bright sunny day, a shower of rain sufficed to
speedily render them almoBt impassable. Travellers
using vehicles or horses were heavily taxed, at the
same lime the revenue thus raised was totally insuffi-
cient for the purpose for which it was required, the
consequence being an enormous amount of debt, the
interest m which at the present time consumes a
considerable percentage of the sums annually raised
by the taxation of those making use of the roads on
which the toll-gates still exist. The management of
the vrious turnpike trusts appears to have fallen into
the hands of the legal profession, to whom they have
proved almost as rich a source ot wealth as has the
Chancery Cturt itself. To rescue the different trusts
from the grasp of the lawyers, and afterwards to re-
place the system of turnpike tolls by one based on the
plan of a county rate, has been the object of those
endeavouring to sting about a better state of things.
In this they are proving very successful, the chief
difficulty being the vast amount of debt with which
the various trusts are encumbered. Indeed, so great
is the progress made, that it is probable the day is not
very far distant when the millennium of the children of
Rebecca shall have arrived, and not a toll-gate be
known in the kingdom. The effects of the abolition
of the turnpike system on local traffic will be im
menee, rspecially in agricultural districts where it has
long impeded the development of agricultural enter-
prise and improvements.
The reappearance of distress in the eastern metro-
politan districts has again directed public attention to
the subject of emigration. The recent American mail
informs us that ""An 'Immigration Convention,' in-
tended to unite in one body all the societies through-
out America, formed for the encouragement of immi-
gration and the protection of immigrants, has just
been held at Baltimore."" If our Transatlantic brethren
really desire to avail themselves of our surplus labour
thev will have no difficulty in procuring it, but the
majority of English statesmen would, we suspect,
rather behold the stream of labour drifting
towards Australia. The Welch, it may be remem-
bered, have attempted to form a colony in Patagonia.
There seems, after all, a chance of the experiment
turning out satisfactorily, notwithstanding the diffi-
culties with which its promoters have had to contend.
The original idea was to make the settlement purely
Welch in character. This portion of the scheme has
now been abandoned, and the influx ot British
colonists is cordially invited. Ina very short time it
is intended to send out a Church clergyman to the
colony, indeed, an application to that effect has I
already been made by the colonists to the Bishop of
Bangor, a circumstance which has encouraged the
formation of a band of Church people as emigrants for
the new colony. The movement is an extremely im-
portant one. If ever a penal settlement is planted in
the Falklands - and the supposition is not an
unlikely one-a system of graduated punish-
ments will probably be attempted by fixing
another settlement on the Fatagoniun coast,
to which the better class of convicts might
be removed. It certainly would be most
unwise to leave it in the power of Russia or America
to get hold of this important part of the world. Al-
ready a French adventurer claims to be ""King of
Patagonia,'* by election of the native tribes. There
may be more than a madman's trick in this ; it may
be that something of the hocus-pocus principle,
characteristic of the recent Fijian treaty, may have
been practised in this particular case. A settlement
half-way between Australia and England would be
invaluable to us, both nationally and commercially.
Providence has evidently handed over the southern
zone to British colonisation, and the presence of an
Anglo-Saxon element in South America may do
much towards remedying the misrule and neglect
by which an effete Spanish race have so-
long closed that large and beautiful country
against the advancing wave of emigration. That
the emigration movement may ultimately become
diverted to the South may be inferred from a very
remarkable paper, by Mr. C. H. Pearson, on "" The
Land Question in the ""United States,"" in which it is
contended that the wholesale manner in which Ame-
rican capital is being invested in American land will,
within the next twenty years, cause the stoppage of
the facilities and inducements at present held by
""United States emigrants. He also tells us that "" the
future of our colonies is in their own hands, that the
land reserve of which they dispose is one that may
easily be exhausted, and that in ""Victoria a cry against
any encouragement to fresh emigrants is already a
watchword with the popular party."" Comfortable
thinking this, eh? But what are we to do if the
rest of the world is to be closed against our surplus
population? "" Teach the people,"" says Mr. Pear-
son, and remember "" if the work be not done within
the next twenty years, it is just possible that our
children may have to maintain order, and whatever
makes up society, by the sword."" Perhaps it will
not be quite so bad as that. At least, we hope not.
It is, however, not very encouraging to those
desirous of founding new enterprises in the Southern
hemisphere, to read the accounts of the recent pro-
ceedings in connection with the attempted winding
up of the Panama, New Zealand, and Australian
Boyal Mail Company. The Times calls attention to ?
the circumstance "" that the course of post between
this country and New Zealand and Australia, via
Panama, has now been reduced to less than four
months,replies to the letters which left Southampton
on the 2nd of July having been received on the 27th
instant, a period of only 117 days. Of this,' 22 days
and nine days respectively were afforded in New Zea-
land and Sydney for answering letters, the time occu-
pied on the through voyage each way between
Wellington and Southampton being 47¿ days, and
between Sydney and Southampton 54 days.""
The publication of this statement has tended to
revive public confidence in the possible future
prosperity of the enterprise, should the desire of the
gieat body of creditors be complied with. This desire
is that ""the company should be continued, there
being every reason to believe that the undertaking
can be worked with profitable results."" There exists
also a general impression amongst all interested in
such matters that if the various suggestions made by
Mr. Cave, M.P., at the recent extraordinary general
meeting of the Company, were carried out, they would
result in complete success. It is a significant circum-
stance that at the recent half-yearly meeting of the
Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, an opinion was
expressed by the shareholders that proceedines
adverse to the Panama, New Zealand, and Australian
Royal Mail Company should be avoided, and that, as
the service across the Pacific contributes to the re-
ceipts of the Boyal Mail Company, increased facilities
should be afforded for developing the traffic with the
Australasian colonies. In the report of the same
Company, just issued, allusion is made to the finan-
cial difficulties of the Panama Company, and a hope
is expressed that this service will be continued, as it
has been -worked with great regularity, and has of
course brought traffic to the Royal Mail Company.
Ihe fatewell dinner to Sir James Fergusson, the
new Governor of South Australia, at Willis's Rooms,
was a great success, If Sir James only creates as
favourable an impression at the Antipodes as he did
at the banquet, the South Australians will
have no cause to regret his arrival. He
spoke with much good sense, and seemed perfectly
wwe of the responsibilities attached to his new
office. Although his Conservative views have acted
as a hindrance to his gaining popularity here, people
have not forgotten his presence in the Crimea, and
how he wa» wounded at the battle of Inkermann.
Mr. Disraeli certainly might have made a worse
appointment.! The dinner itself was a brilliant affair,
as such celebrations generally are, especially when
held at Willis'sJRooms. Among the features of the
evening was the .? loving cup "" filled with real South
Australian wine, scarcely distinguishable from the best
claret. Whether Australian beef or mutton graced
the tables neither gntsts nor waiters seemed to know.
But then your real cook is such a genius. We do
not always know what we eat.
A collision at the mouth of the Thames, whereby
the Leichhardt, a ship boundj from London to New
i ¿«aland, was run down and sunk by the steamer
North Star, has revived the public interest in the
subject of the increasing number of disaster, at sea.
The Board of Trade has ordered an inquiry into the
matter, it being asserted that the pilot in charge of the
steamer was drunk. To call the affair a collision
set ms a misuse of the word. As a morning journal
very truly remarks, "" the case for the assessors of the
Boord of Trade in the matter of the Leichardt and the
North Star is as simple as a ease of assault in a police
court, when a drunken passer-by has knocked down a
sober and inoffensive person standing still on the
public pavement."" Has it ever entered the heads of
insurance companies and shipowners that a consider
able proportion of the losses incurredby them may
have arisen fi om the intemperate habits of those in
charge of their vessels ? It is to be feared that drun-
kenness is as terrible in its destructive effects on
sea as well as on land. The captain, no leas than
the common seaman, is not above the temptation,
offered by the brandy bottle, and in too many caaes
a cargo of gunpowder, would be far less dangerous
than is the presence of a barrel of rum in the ship's
hold. It is a significant fact, that the proportion of
voyages safely made by temperance captains-and
there are many such-is double, and even treble, that
made by their drinking brethren. If the rum bottle
were banished from aboard ships, the number of
shipping disasters would speedily become dimin-
ished.
But the drink-demon is persecuting us even more
heavily on land, for to its influence ia directly traceable
much of the pauperism with which we are cursed,
and which is daily increasing to such an
extent as to appal all who have become
acquainted with the same. New workhouses, in-
firmaries, asylums for the imbecile poor, and other
institutions, are being erected in all directions, but
the more we provide accommodation the more it
becomes required. Pauperism is increasing faster
than the means of relief, and how it will end no one
dares predict. The new Parliament will be called
upon to solve many questions, but none of auch im-
portance as this. Ihe pressure of local taxation ia
also increasing at a fearful tate. In St. Paneras the
angry ratepayers are up in arms ; in other parishes
the murmur of discontent is daily growing more and
more loud. In Hackney, the"" poor-rates for the
twelve months ending Lady Day, 1868, wore £35,000.
For the six months ending Lady Day, 18G9, they will
be i36,000 ! It is everywhere the same. Tura which
way we will-North, East, West, or South-the
same dismal picture presents itself. What are we
to do ? The new j ear ""will dawn anything but hope-
fully for us. With poverty and disease waiting
sadly at our gate, how are we to enjoy Christmas r
In the presence of this terrible social problem, all
political questions sink into utter insignificance. We
care not whether Ritualists carry on their senseless
mummeries to a greater or lesser extent-we care not
whether my Lord Fiddle-de-dee is to wield the rein»
of political power, or whether they are to be entrusted
to the charge of my Lord Tweedledum ; but we do
care whether or not we are to continue to bear thia
festering canker in our very midst, eating up
our prosperity, and dragging us down from.
the temple of our pride. Would that the
day had arrived when men, forgetting their religious
and political differences, strove to exert themselves to
ameliorate the condition of our poorer brethren. Hoir
mean, contemptible, and ignoble seem all these petty
bickerings about points of religious doctrine or arti-
cles of political faith, in presence of tho dark cloud
which is beginning to gather over our social fortunes.
If men would but imbibe a little more of the true
spirit which animated Him, whose birthday will
before these lines are being read beneath the Southern
Cross-have been celebrated with gladness and joy
throughout the civilised wotld, we might hope for
better thingB. And yet, what right have we to
despair.

Mr. Mullens deserves tho thanks of evoiy member of our
society for drawing attention to tho proposition which is to
bo submitted at the next General Meeting, for tho appro-
priation of £80,000 towards difraving the cost of erecting
and furnishing a HEAD OFFICE.
I am ono of the oldest members, and am, porhnps, entitled
to the moro respect for not, until now. ever having
"" troubled "" ti.o meetings with "" my vio.vs "" upon the
many knotty points that havo bt>en discussed from fimo to
timo ; but when I hear that it is contemplated to wasto
£80,000 to gratify a tnsto for architecture and grand dis-
play, I muat enter my protest against such a wrong. I had
always supposed that tho prêtent building was quite
adequate to all tho society's requirements ; but, as Mr.
Mullens writes, LET US TALK IT ovr.ii A. LITTLE.
I ndvise every member to road his excellent rcmar'.rs up in

sound advice, by attending tho meeting mid drawing cio
clusion» from tho various statements which \vill doubt
leas be nmdo theio.

INQUEST ON THE BODY OF GEORGE GAMBLE.
[FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.]
An inquest was held before Mr Brown, coroner for the dis-
trict, at the Weatherboard Inn, ""Western Road on the 17th
instant, upon the body of George Gamble, nineteen years
of age, who was killed on Thursday evening, while driving
a dray loaded with blasting powder, which exploded.
William McManamey, on oath, deposed: I am a senior
constable of police, stationed at Pulpit Hill, Bathurst dis-
trict , about 8 o'clock last evening, I was informed at the
station that there had been an explosion of two tons of
blasting powder, that was being conveyed on a dray owned
by James Melville, and driven by deceased, the powder
was the property of Mr. W. W. Watkins, railway con-
tractor; I proceeded to Spring-hill, five miles from the
police station; I there saw the body of deceased, it was
forty feet from where the dray was when the powder
blew up, the body was quite naked, the skin
being scorched off all over, it was lying on its
stomach, the hands stretched forward, some of the
bowels were twisted round the fence that encloses
the railway cuttings, I found the left foot of deceased was
about four yards from the body and through the fence; it
appeared as if it had been torn off by striking against the
fence; there were marks on the post of the fence as if the
body had struck against it; on examining the body I ob-
served that the head was nearly torn from the trunk, it
was only held on by a small piece of skin on ths lsft side of
the neck, the right side of the head, face, and neck had
a black, burnt appearance, tha skin and hair of the head
were torn off for several inches, the right ear was wholly
gone, the eyes were black and scorched , the jaws and face
were smashed, the arms broken, the right hip was very
black and torn inwards for a depth of from two to three
inches, and for a circle of six inches the flesh was gone. It
appeared as if the right side of deceased was nearest the
fire, the right leg below tbe knee was broken , the axle of
the dray lay on the side of the road, ten feet from
where the dray was at the time of the explosion, one tire
of wheel is some considerable distance further off, there
is no other trace of a dray left, one of the horses was lying
on his near side about five yards away , the entrails
were strewn over the road, the heart laying some distance
from the body, another horse appeared as if he bad been
forced along the road with great velocity, his back was
broken near the shoulders, and entrails forced out; a
third horse was found about thirty yards away, and had
been lifted from the road over the railway
cutting and fence enclosing it, he was quite blind; a
fourth horse had the off hind leg tom away, was scorched, and
blind, since dead , a fifth had the hoof torn off the hind leg,
blind, since dead, the sixth is very much scorched and
nearly blind , the harness is all destroyed; the banks at the
side of the road were much torn up , the telegraph wire was
blown off half a dozen of the posts, three panels of fencing
were broken, and posts and rails split about 40 feet off.
John Keegan deposed I have a contract with Mr.
Watkins for the cartage of blasting powder from the railway
station, Penrith, to No. 4 section Great Western Railway
extension, I1 helped to load deceased's dray on Monday
last, I objected to take the powdor in its then unfit state
for transit, numbers of the casks being loose, and the
powder escaping from them, Mr. Francis, and Mr. Watkins,
clerk of works, said if I did not take the powder some one
else would, and that my security (£100) would pay for a
good deal of the carriage; I, to save my security,
loaded deceased's dray, and two others driven by
my self, I felt the risk my drivers incurred
so much that I begged Mr Watkins not to
allow the powder to be sent, he did not interfere, as the
teams proceeded along the road theo powder was dropping
out, when riding up from Pennth this morning there
were traces of the powder all the way along, and on several
occasion when my horse trod on it the loose powder ex-
ploded, sending flame up to the horses girth.
Michael Redden deposed; I am a carrier, and was about
seven yards ahead of deceased at the time of the explosion,
had been travelling with him for two or three miles, de-
ceased was, when I first saw him a few minutes before the
occurrence, walking at the side of the dray, he was sober;
I saw powder along the road, it had dropped from the dray
in front of me, driven by Pat Keegan, after the discharge
I found one of deceased's shaft horses had been driven
under my dray between the wheels, I had some difficulty
m gotting the horse extricated from its position, no part
of deceased's dray or loading was visible after the explo-
sion, I saw deceased's body after it was found.
John Redden deposed; I was about fifty yards behind
deceased's dray, when the powder took fire a turn of the
road intercepted my view, mv horses turned round on the
road and knocked me down, when I recovered no dray or
loading was to be seen, deceased was sober, and did not
smoke, I saw the body of deceased after it was found,
powder was strewn along the road from the drays that pre-
ceded me; I helped my brother to get the horse from under
his team.
Patrick Keegan deposed; I loaded at the same time with
deceased, I heard my father (J. Keegan) refuse to
take the powder in the drays, which he after-
wards did at the instigation of Mr. Francis, the
casks were quite unfit to be moved , half on each load were
loose, hoops broken, and heads not tight, from the start
the powder was strewing on the road, they said to them-
selves often that they would be blown up , my father fol-
lowed as far as the top of Lapstone Hill, to caution us to
use every care for this time, and he would throw up the
contract before he would expose us to such risk again;
when the explosion took place he was about thirty yards
ahead, I was standing on the shaft of my wag-
on, I was thrown off , as I was descending I
was struck near theo eye with the telegraph wire, that was
just at same instant blown off the posts; I did not perceive
that it was deceased's load that exploded at first, I thought
it was my own , I started to run away, but seeing my load
untouched, I proceeded to where deceased's dray had been;
I saw deceased's body found, he did not drink any intoxi-
cating liquor, or smoke, after we started from the Plains.
The jury found a verdict of ""Accidentally killed, by ex-
plosion of gunpowder,"" adding the following rider, viz :-
'The parties in charge of the powder belonging to Mr.

""WH are now enjoying the most enjoyable weather, and tho
late rains have caused the country to look lovely. The
paBt season has not been bad for the hay crop ; potatoes,
maize, and fruit IIBTO been a foilure, excepting crapes. The
plough is in many places at work, and considerable prepara-
tions taking place, grubbing and fencing, for next harvest.
Our grass no sooner begins to grow than we are again
infested with sheep It is a great temptation to suppress
giving reports of rainfalls, OB tho gross-stealors are
evidently watchingtheir various chanccB.
On lïonday lait a meeting was held in Murphy's
Theatre, protcstirg against Mr. Road Superintendent
Woods' conduct in carrying out the works in this district,
and more particulatly the picsent unfinished and dangerous
state of the dam. There was a unanimous feeling against
Mr. Woods, ando petit ;on was adopted setting forth the
grievances of the Tarkes people, which was to bo fowarded
to ¿Messrs. Buchanan and Lord.
On 'i hursday lait, a child of Mr. J. Gallaher, of tho
ScuTct, got lost ii the bush. Diligent search was made
without success nntl Friday, when, accidentally, some dig-
gers discovered tho poor child some ten miles from its home.
As the' little thin j was not throo years old it was not
imagined that it could have gone fur, and tho surmiso was
that it might have, fallon into one-of tho many diggers'
holc3 that ubouixl si that locality. The distance travelled
by BO young a child is marvellous.
The Coradgery station on the Bogan, for a long timo past
i tho property of Messrs. J. and G. Palmer, was sold to
Messrs. Kirkpatrici and Cairns, of Gundagai, for £20,000.
Rain has fallen pbntifully on this station lately, and also
on tho Upper Bogm generally, but I hear from reliable
information that the Lower Bogan Í3 suffering still from
diought. It appcafs there have been so many dams made
lately along the Bojan, several of which will run the water
some five milos bick, that it will take a long and heavy
downpour to lill all tho dams and cause tho water to get
below. I believe thero are dams now on the Bogan that
when filled will laave but few intervals without water.
A meeting of the Public School Local Board took place
last week. It wa3 tnnounccd that Miss Nowton had coen
appointed assistant teacher. Applications were considered
from parents who were anxious to send their children to
pchool without foo. It appears that the meetings of tho
Coard have not bien held as often as should hive been
tho case, and it wai agreed at their last meeting that the
Council of Education should bo requested to striko off the
names of soma of tho members unless they attend. It is
hard to say how many children are deprived of education
when the application for admission to the school can only
bo entertained by tho Local Board, and if the Board does
not meet as often as it ought.
Our cricketers lave returned from Orange jubilant
enough, and of couno we approciato their success as regards
themselves and its nlue to Parkes.
Nothing new in mining; but it is to be hoped, among tho
many prospectors out, something will turn up soon.
I was on M'Guigan's the other day, and coming upon
it suddenly from tío bush, I could not make out where I
was. Certainly the once prosperous town of M'Guigan
was out of sight, neal .y all the buildings removed, and the
main street scarcely traceable, save and except the worthy

COOK V. 11Y11NEÍ, AND ANOTHEK.
Tho trial of this case, which had already lasted two
days, was resumed and concluded.
It was on action bj- Simon Cook, a farmer of Illawarra,
against James Bj-mcs and William Byrnes, proprietors of
tho Mount Pleasant Colliery, to recover damages for the
pollution of a creek or small stream of fresh water which
ran through tho plaintiff's land, by coal from tho defend-
ants' worts. Tho plaintiff'B declaration put tho case in
two ways, first, that the creek had been wilfully polluted
by tho casting of coal therein ; secondly, that tho damiegti
had been the result of ncgltgenco. Tho defendants had
pleaded-first, a general doninl that thej- had dono any
injury to tho plaintiff ; secondly, that whatever injury had
been inflicted lind been the unavoid.iblo result of what thoy
had done in the lawful conduct of their businoss as coal
lumera.
Sir William Manning, Q.C., Mr. Darloy, and Mr. Salo-
mons, instructed by Mr. Maguire, appeared for the plaintiff;
and Mr.,Butlor, instructed by Messrs. Allen, Bowden, and
Allen, for the defendants.
Tho plaintiff was the lessee of Spring G rovo, a farm of
fifty acres, at Fairy Meadow, Wollongong district,
in the vicinity pf the Mount Pleasant Colliery. His
case was that a small stream of water which ran through
his and other lands in that neighbourhood had been ren-
dered unfit for uso bj- tho deposit of n largo quantity of
slocOc coal from the collierj' in question, ana that his farm
had boen otherwise injured from the samo cause. Tho
defendants' caso was that there had been no such injury,
and that although the creek might have boon partially fillod
up by slack coal, this had not been the result of any care
lossnoss on tho part of tho emploj-ccs at the colliery, but of
n land slip, the result of a flood, for which tho defendants
were not responsible. The evidenco was very voluminous,
and in'many respects very conflicting. Tho amount really
in question was a small one, but tho object of tho contest
was rather, it would appear, to determine tho genorol ques-
tion whether or not tho proprietors of cool mines in that
district were to be held responsible for damages of this cha-
racter. According to the plaintiff and his witnesses the
creek had clearly been damaged by the presence of a
quantity of slack coal which hod como down from an
immense henp noar the mouth of the mine-a result bl ought
about by the carelessness of the minors in allowing bo vast
an accumulation at such a place. Tho supply of water from
this creek had previously been regular ana abundant. Tho
water, although a littlo hard for washing purposes, hail
been excellent for every other kind of domestic use, but
since the conl had come down it had been quito useloss.
Tho waterholes had boen completely filled up, so that the
constancy of tho supplj- of water was to it great extent put
an end to, and such as was still to bo had was very bad.
The flood, too, bad carried tho slack coal over some of tho
cultivated land, and hod destroj-cd or damaged tho crops.
Cook had about forty head of cattle which had boen accus-
tomed to drink at this stream, but which could
now scarcely use ii. He had boon compelled
therefore to sink a well. Ho had offered to toke £20
in full compensation for these injuries, and for this sum to
clear out the bed of tho creek himself, but tho defendants
had refused lo give him that amount and had offered only
£10. According to tho defendant«' wltnosses the water of
this creek, which had always been a littlo brackish,.had
been in no way injured by tie influx of slack coal, which
was far less than had been represented, and was occasioned
solely by a landslip during a flood which hod brought down
at the samo time a largo quantity of soil. The spread of
slack coal over tho land to a small extent had rather a
tendency to increaso its productiveness than otherwise, and
tho catUo had in no way suffered. The^offer of £10 had
been tendered, it was sworn, without prejudico-that is to
say without admitting any liability-and only in tho hope
by dealing liberally with tho plaintiff to save all trouble and
expense. Samples of tho water from . this
creek were exhibited in Court, whioh sample«
presented a very uninviting appearance. It was contended
tint they had not been fairly token, but that the water must
havo been btorcd up, but this was denied. Some of this water
was analysed by Mr. Watt, from whose evidence it would
appear that its"" foulness aid not in all probability result
from tho presence of coal, but from that of organic matter.
It further appeared that watcrcrcsscs wore growing plen-
tifully in the creek, and that decomposed vegetable matter
might in dry weather help to make the water bad. Tho
water of the creek, according to Mr. Watt, was naturally
brackish, and tho slack coal from this'mino when settled
(as it. would, settle) ,at. tho bottom of theiBtreain when
' 'net flowing rapidly- would'« not pollute it as alleged.
There was nirtfccr evidence that a stream of water coming
.ut of the same seam of coal was quite pure, and was con-
stantly used for domestic purposes. Seme of the coal was
broken up in Court and placed in tumblers ef water, upon
which it left a slight scum, although without otherwiso
rendering the water apparently impure. The impurity, J
however, va« most positively «vom to by the plaintiff'« *
**""?""-~-i _.
.witnosBcs. Somo evidence was gone into on the part of tho
I ?'_.nti(T lo show that tho lond-slip, if it did canso tho dam-
age (which was denied), lind been the result of some mis-
management of tho excavation. This was mot by direct
contradiction on tho(pnrt of tho defendants. Tho ovidenco
was directly contradictory na to the quantity of slack coal
in tbo heap nenr the colliery, and in nearly ovcry other im-
portant particular, even ¡is to tho local features of tho
gi omul.
His IIokoh directed the jury that the plain ques-
tion for their deteniiiuation was whothor or not tho
plaintiff hnd mndo ont any claim to damages for
injurj"" sustained by him through any want oi duo core on
tho p'nrt of tho defendants' employes. Evory man had a
right to work n coal mine, but ho was bound so to monago
it as that his neighbours should not bo injured. Against
lend slips nud floods no amount of caro could guarel ; but
tho miners wero bound to exctciso duo caro and forethought
so ns when buch accidents took placo their neighbours
might bo «s little injured as possiblo by any escapo from tho
minc.

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1871.
THE terrible events of Paris have set all
persons accustomed to inquire into the causes
of things to endeavour to expound those which
Have led to this fearful episode in the history
of civilization. The strength of the rebellion
and the destruction which it wrought, the
terrible sacrifice of life in its suppression,
and the apparent reappearance of its elements
in another form, have filled the world with
wonder and with alarm. ""Where is it all to
end?
The highest form of civilization existing in
Europe has, by common consent, been attri-
buted to Paris. The moat perfect examples
of skill, both in science and in art, have been
furnished by its population. It was the most
beautiful city, and had the greatest range of
pleasures of every kind, and in the most perfect
order. Europe received from the French
theatre its popular plays, It received from
the same source its universal fashions. Luxury
pf all kinds was carried to the highest per-
fection in Paris. Nowhere was the art of
cookery capable of producing such diet. In no
'country could all the adornments of the house,
of the person, of the table, be so readily
'assembled. The rich people of eveiy nation
hastened to Paris to partake of these splen-
dours and these pleasures, which continued
throughout the season without intermission.
The citizens of this great metropolis of gaiety
and enjoyment looked with complacency on the
. gathering of all people to pay homage to their
intelligence, skill, and boundless resources.
.Those who look back two or three years to
'what Paris was-say, when the Great Exhibi-
tion attracted all the world-and what Paris
has become, may well be stunned with aston-
ishment or moved with pity. All this
splendour and plensure passed away, and the
city finally fell under the power of its loweßt
inhabitants, who endeavoured to gain its con
tiol, to subject its wealth, its intelligence, its
refinement, all it possessed, to a domination
which, when embodied in the persons of
ihose who wielded it, strikes the mind with
absoluta terror.
A splendid paper has been contributed to
the Revue des Deua Mondes, by M. E. CAKO,
on one phase of this great phenomenon,
entitled, "" The End of Bohemia, or the lite-
rary Influences in these Last Events.*' This
treatise attributes the Communist Revolution
to the ascendancy of that class created by the
refinements and the yicissitudes of the great
city. A Bohemian signifies, in French phrase,
a writer living by ephemeral literature, an in-
ferior artist of any kind, a member of the
medical or legal orders without patients or
clients.-any person, in short, thrown upon
the casualties of a calling, and dependent
day by day upen the fluctuating success of a
profession. It is from this class have arisen
the writers who have corrupted, or at least
expressed the ¡corruption of, Parisian society.
I They are principally persons who have no
recognised position, no established reputation,
who live day by day having this question
continually recurring, Where shall we dine, and
how shall we pay for our meal ? They live on
the margin of society, in isolation. They are
devoured by envy. Their chances are an
election to the academy of France, or a place in
the hospital or^in the morgue. These persons,
having no recognised status in society, have
made themselves the expounders of every senti-
ment which divides and corrupts it. They
have produced a literature only copied faintly
| in the English publications. All the bad
passions of mankind have been analysed and
laid open in the mocking tone of those who share
them, who have boasted of them, and who haye
been destroyed by them. They have professed
no moral principle, they have offered no ideal,
they have animuted no effort for the improve-
ment of mankind. They have put, without
disguise, the defects and disordeis of society
into the language of derision, and, while they
have lessened the respect for human nature
as a whole, they ha\e been equally opposed to
all those institutions which have been de-
signed to raise the fallen and solace the dis-
tressed. Their lessons have been intended to
excite a hatred against the persons of men, an
envy of their good fortune, and of those
superiorities which arise from knowledge or
industry. The only tone in which they have
been known to addiess the unhappy portions
of society has been calculated not to relieve
but to exasperate their resentment. They
have said to the vicious that they have been
made so by the organization of society; to
those who have found it difficult to live, that
the rich have taken away their natural right to
their portion in this world. All that society
has secured by united labour foi the go»d of
the State has been treated as deductions from
the daily enjoyment of the workman. The
employers of labour have been always spoken
of as criminals, who are joined together in con-
spiracy against the operatives.
The consequence of thiB kind of ""education,
continued for twenty years under the shadow
of an Imperial system, was to produce a fixed
hatred of everything that existed and a
desperate determination to reverse, to over
tlnow, and to sweep all that had been ex-
hibited as the representative of wealth or dis-
tinction. It is this literature which has found
in tiie daily Press a full development for the
last two years. The relaxation of the
laws and the fall of the Empire gave
still fuller scope for these opinions.
The conduct of many prominent persons
afforded the text of satire and denunciation.
During the siege of Paris the clubs were j
ruined, and the Bohemian class made them the
medium of their propagandism. Men, women,
and children attended these assemblies, and
the most extravagant oratory found the
warmest reception. There were two classes of
speakers. Commonly the orators of the work-
ing class had somo degree of sincerity. But the
old leaders weie mete actors ; they were
. obtaining a living or a place without any
faith in the principles which they proclaimed.
They had experienced a long trial of patience.
Their contribution* to the Press could not in
ordinary times provide them with bread. The
revolution carne lo float them upon the surface.
When the Commune was proclaimed they
seized its guidance. They appropriated
the profits upon which they could
lay their hands, and, without believing in the
permanence of anything, turned to present
account the wild rage of those who were
incapable of discerning their delusions. The
number of men of this class who assumed
omeo in the Commune was remarkable. They
had a degree of education, of science, and
knowledge of society, but they had long been
nmong the disinherited. What a change,
then, to become, even for three months, the
dignitaries of a great city, and to command
an army of 100,000 men.
A remarkable development of the Commune
was the prominence it gave to some female
politicians. The emancipation of woman was
a grand cry. Lectures were delivered and
journals published by them in this interest.
The incidents of the last revolution show how
frightful was the demoralisation of Communist
women. i
Among the stimulants of mischief with
which the Bohemian had been long familiar
is to be reckoned the use of absinthe. This
dangerous liquor produces a special kind of
frenzy more pernicious than ordinary spirits,
and more maddening than opium. It is im-
possible to say how far even this agent of
human degradation is responsible for the crimes
of the revolution.
The author attributes the character of this
insurrection to the utter absence of religious
principle in the Bohemian class. While the
savons and philosophers have been propound-
ing the doctrines of atheism in elegant lan-
guage, and as the means of liberating the
mind from all prejudices, the lower classes
of writers have accepted their conclusions, and
surrounded them with all the decorations of
an obscene literature. Every excitement to
the indulgence of the passions has been pro
¡ duced in their writings ; and their whole
s) stem - has been based on negations. Is
there a GOD? No. Is there a future
state'? No. IS there a soul? No. Is
there responsibility for tinknown actions'?
There is none. Is theie any compensation
for patient suffering? Never. Is there any
reason for the relations of social life ? No
These have been the set of principles with
which Communism has started There are
numbers who have professed to substitute
others for them ; but these at present have
remained in all their deadly influence, and
havö shown themselves in the terrible events
of this last civil war.
AN , interesting discussion took place a few
.months ago in the Ilouse of Commons in
relation to harbours of refuge on the English
coast. The question involved the considera-
tion of a large variety of facts, commercial,
humanitarian, and national. The debate arose
on a motion by Lord C. J. HAMILTON, whose
object was to obtain a grant of public
money for the construction of a harbour of
refuge at Filey in Yorkshire. The policy
of making further grants of public money
to construct and improve harbours of refuge
on the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland
had been the subject of inquiry and solici-
tation during the previous fourteen years.
A committee recommended that national money
should be granted for the construction
of harbouis of refuge, and that funds
should also be voted towards the extension
and improvement of existing harbours. It
was also proposed that a commission of
inquiry should -visit the coast for the pur-
pose of inquiry. This was delayed by
change of Government ; but the commis-
sioners having been appointed, brought up
a report recommending that £2,365,000
should be granted, with loans at a low
tate of interest for harbours, on condition
that cci tain stated local suma should be
raised to meet the national grants. These
facts were stated by Lord HAMILTON, who
also gave an account of the numerous
attempts which had been made in vain to
give practical effect to the report of the
commissioners, which, however, was opposed
on the ground that it was "" altogether too
sweeping."" Mr. MILNER GIBSON, when Pre-
sident of the Board of Trade, incurred con-
siderable odium by his opposition, and when
sailors were drowned on the coast, there
were those who did not hesitate to speak
of the widows of those unfortunate
seamen, as "" MILNER GIBSON'S widows.""
Attempts to induce the House to adopt the
report of the commissioners were renewed in
each session from 1862 to 1865, and the sub-
ject was revived in 1866 and 1869, but without
any results satisfactory to its promoters.
Among the commercial facts adduced during
the debate it was stated that the trade was
most extensive on the north-east coast, and
that its harbours were barred, and there-
fore not approachable at all tides. It was
ghen in e-vidence that the entire tonnage of
British sailing vessels clearing coastwise from
ports in England was 8,162,000 tons ; coast
wajs and foreign together, 15,796,00<>; and
that the annual loss to the nation by wrecks
ivas a million and a half sterling. But since
that e\idcnce was given there had been a very
laige increase in the foreign as well as in
the coasting trade. The total foreign and
toasting trade in 1857 was 23,178,782 tons
(Blitish ships), or an average per month
of 1,931,565 tons. But in February of the
present year, the total foreign and coasting
trade was 5,156,000 tons. Taking the coasting
trade only there was a considerable increase
shown. In 186-9, the coasting trade for the
month of February showed 2,587,000- tons.
In February, 1871, it represented 2,684,900
tons. Lord HAMILTON, speaking of the
fisheries on the coast, quoted from the report
oí the Commissioners of Fisheries in 1866,
to show that the annual value of the fisheries
on the east coast was £2-,000,000, and that
""the north-east coast fisheries were of the
same extent as the supcrfitial area of
Ireland, and were annually increasing in
value to the extent of £10,000 per
annum."" The Boaid of Trade re-
turn showed, iL that the number of re-
gistered fishing boats in England was 16,195,
representing 127,013 tons, and employing
I 47,290 men, and 7467 boys.""
These figures, indicating the large commercial
interest at stake, were not disputed, and facts
were given te show how gieat are the advan-
tages which may be expected from an improve-
ment of the harbours on the coast. As in this
colony in regard to railways, so there appears
to have been in the House of Commons on
this matter much local rivalry, and
the question divided itself into two main
branches - first, as to the expediency
of spending large sums of money on one
harbour of refuge, when (it was arguod)
"" unless '.they were multiplied almost ad
wßnitum they would be of very little use;"" |
and, second, as to how far Government
assistance ought to be extended towards the
improvement of harbours. It was stated by
one member that the Government had advanced
money on easy terms to the Tyne Harbour
commisioners. Another observed that the
sum of £1,600,000 had been spent during the
last few years in improving the approach to
the Tyne Uiver so as to render it a good
harbour of refuge ; that most of the
money was made a local charge ; and
that, in consequence of the improvements
effected, a herring fishery had been estab-
lished there. By an Act passed in 1861,
money may be granted for harbour improve-
ments on condition that it be repaid, with
interest, in twenty years. The Tyne Harbour
commissioners had availed themselves of
these harbour loans; but it was remarked
that they had not done so to such an ex
lent as they would otherwise have been
glad to do had the interest not been in-
creased. They obtained £100,000 at 3J per
cent., and another £100,000 at 3.J per cent. ;
but the Government after that refused to
lend to them at less than 5 per cent.,
and the commissioners became reluctant to
borrow on those terms.
From a national standpoint it was argued
that Filey ought to bo made a harbour of
refuge. It was contended that the events
of the past few months had altogether
altered the military position of the country;
that England had now to look for danger
norn the East, and that therefore the |
construction of a naval station on the east
coast was a matter of serious moment. It
was also remarked by the mover that
Filey was recommended by the committee of
1857 from a strategetical point of view-1
that it would be good as a look-out, and
safe for shipping in time of war. Several
authorities were quoted showing the import-
ance of a naval station on the east coast,
and these were supplemented by arguments
based on local considerations.
The humanitarian reasons urged recall the
dangers and sacrifices annually made in the
cause of commerce and navigation - the
terrible disasters which occur to vessels baffled
by winds and unable to weather rocky
points - ships with torn sails and broken
masts left to the fury of a gale - the
foundering of vessels unable to find a
pott of refuge, and long lines of coast
black with wreck. The members were
reminded of "" scenes of agony which
beggared description,"" and certainly the loss
of life shown is most lamentable. All this
was admitted by the Government. Mr.
GLADSTONE quoted from a Parliamentary
paper the number ©f shipwrecks which had
occurred during eleven years, showing that
1480 lives had been lost on the south coast,
1240 on the north coast, and 2772 in the
Irish Sea. But the inference he drew from
the figures was, that there was no
material différence to be traced be-
tween those portions of the coast which
had harbours of refuge, and those which had
not. The policy of the Government was
clearly stated to be in favour of an improve-
ment in the mercantile marine, and it was
held that a reckless plan for a wholesale
creation of bar-harbours would have the effect
of retarding that improvement. It was argued,
however, on the other side, that much re-
mained yet to be done, inasmuch as it could'
not be denied, in the face of wrecks so
numerous, that many ships went to sea in
an unsafe condition.
But the most fatal objection to the propo-
sition appeared to be its local- application ;
and upon this point Mr. GLADSTONE and
Mr. LOWE spoke out boldly. The former
said he could not do otherwise than euter
his protest against local propositions of the
kind, "" because they were a fruitful source
of political demoralization."" Mr. LOWE said :
-"" The noble mover did not propose to fol-
low the general spirit of the recommendation
of the Commission, but picked out one iso-
lated point, with respect to which the Consoli-
dated Fund was to contribute all, and local
resources nothing. A more fatal blow, not
only at the Exchequer, but at the reputation
of that House, could not be imagined. He
had some experience on such a point. He had
been a member of a Colonial Assembly, the
greatest part of the time of which was taken
up in discussing measure» such as the noble
lord now proposed, involving the application
of general revenue to local purposes, such as
the making of a road in one place, or the con-
struction of a railway in another. The main
time of the Legislature was occupied in that
most discreditable manner, and he, therefore,
ventured from practical experience to warn
the House not to encourage such motions as
the present, for it would find no course so
injurious to the respect and estimation it
should be held in by the 'public as countenanc-
ing the grant out of the general revenue of the
country of money to be expended for local
purposes.""

some ambiguity about Hie epistle. The operation of
""thoroughly gutti-g"" a window requires explana-
tion, and what tho "" offering "" to the "" god-

the letter as a whole leads to the inference that semothing

Sir,-Ihavo read Mr Luideman's and "" AA'tnc-.owor's ""
lenora on tho abovo subject m your issuo of to day with
»orno interest. 'Ino last-named gtutloman hnj not tho
.lightest difficulty in admitting that all tho vi incs of com
morco aro brandied at loast to the extent of 20 per cent ,
while nome, as ha very truthfnlly pula it, aro quito inno-
cent of a ningi» drop of tho juico of tho grape Admitting
' this to be the case, will two wrongs mako a right i Are
we to allow colonial wines, that aro largely diluted or mixed
with brandy, to bo sold at a very low hctnso fco simply
bocauso foreign wines aro so mixed i I think not, and so
far as I am a judgo I have no hesitation m saying
that tho public opinion of tho connlrv is with Mr Tocob
and others who supported his amendment Mr I indomun
says ho is anxious t-hit tho rising generation of our
Australian youth should not becomo spirit drinkoif» or
inebriates. Yet how can ho hopo for a consummation of
his desire if all our wines aro mixed with spirits to suit tho
spint-ttrmking tastes of an ahead) largely inebriated
people. The rovelHtion mado by "" AVinegrowcr "" should
cortainly cause linn to thirk twice boforo ho recommends tho
drinking of wines as a remedy for lntonipornnce
AVhether wmo will keep vvithuit tho uso of extraneous
spirit or not I cannot decide, but quite rceoiill) one of our
winogro« era on tho Hunter, m discussing this very rmes
tion with me, denlored tho fact that tho eharactcr and good
namo of our wines had benn d stroyed by the system
adopted of fortifying them with brandy lío said that the
wure» themiteilves produced quito enough spirit to keep
thom if properly mado, and that tho only excuse for
adding more spirit was to meet what ho termed the do
prai c3 tasto» of the consumer
Another thing ho complained of was nllovvang stills to be
used The Ufoof thoso simply meant that their stocks of wino
would bo inoxhapstiblo, for they could nlwnvs replerish
their Htockit, having the necessary spirit bv them, heneo
the husmeas of bigitimato wino-growmg was injured and
the publie deceived, and it was his opinion the evil wonld
novor be properly remedied till the Government once moro
disallowed tau uso of thom Referring to tho wino-ihops,
he said they undoubtedly were a groat nuisance, and should
bo dono away with The result, m his opinion, would bo
that good wines wonld bo sold by fair means, and then their
character would onco moro bo redeemed. M) own oxpo
rionoo of thom is that they aro Vit so many sly -grog shop»,
and that th-jy aro doing an mimeiso amount of injury nil
through tho interior of this country But, as an abstainer,
I am glad tho omission of tho wine licenses from tho bill

TUESDAY, JANUARY 19, 1875.
We commented, a few days ago, on the fucij
thatr Sir Redmond Barhy had been sworn-in
as ActiDg-Governefvof Victoria almost immedi-
ately upon the departuie of Sir George
Bowen-a fact that in itself, under the eil .
cumstancee which rendered immediate action,
by an Administrator of the Government Impe-
ratively necessary, was in no degree incom-
patible with the existence of a discretionary
right on the part of the Ministry to have
held, under different circumstances, the dormant
commission in abeyance. Later events
have shown still more clearly that the
whole'Question requires, to, be more carefully
looked into, and that contingencies may aribe
which,involve doubt as to whether they have
been adequately (as they have not been ex-
pressly) .forseen and provided for.
- Ihe difficulty in Ifew South Wales arose
from doubts as to whether the telegram from
the Secretary of State, which the Govern-
ment interpreted as 'constructively sanctioning
their arrangements,<,was sufficient to cure tha
omission on the part of the Queen's instruc-
tions or commission to provide expressly for
the absence of the 'Governor during a longer
period than a month without ¿ailing in ai
Acting-Governor to take his place. The
difficulty in Victoria was not as to the
swearing in of Sir Redmond Babiiy. That
was disposed of by the force of circumstances
which left the Ministry but one course to
follow. The difficulty there arose from tho
absence of the Chief Justice (the Acting-Go-
vernor designate) at the time when an Acting
Governor had to be sworn in, and from his
return whilst the duties of the office were being
discharged by the senior Judge, the official
designated by the commission to take the
office if the Chief Justice were ab.ent.
Was Sir W. Stawell, the Chief Justice, to
assume the Acting-Governorship on his return,
or was Sir Redmond Baeiiy, in whom the
powers of Governor were legally vested, to
retain and exercise them ? Doubt was felt
amongst the lawyers as to whether the power*
of the commission under which Sir Redmond
Bakey had been appointed were not exhausted
bj his appointment. These doubts, however,
were overruled. Sir W. Stawell was sworn
in on the 11th, Sir Rldmond Bakry art
ministering the .oaths. And it is said that in
the event of any embarrassment occurring,
a telegram will be sent to London, asking for
[the execution of a fresh commission.
As this is cutting the Gordian knot, instead
of untying it-a process thati may be ver)
¡agreeaole to ,'Ministries tin Victoria, but is
hardly excusable' on constitutional 'principles-~
the difficulty remains still undisposed of. Let
us, then, inquire into its nature more closely,
The Argus describes Sir W. Stawell as
"" assuming "" the administration of the Govern-
ment, But how was it possible for hira to
assumo it ? Did Sir Redmond Barry give it
up, or was it taken from him, or did it pass
from him by the operation of the commission? I
The last supposition is untenable. If Sir
GroROE Bowen had leturned before Sir W.
Stawell, this sort of self-acting transfer i
would certainly have taken place. Sir Red- I
mond Barry having become Acting-Governor
during the Governor's absence only,- the
Goveinor, in viitue of his own commission^
would have resumed his full powers on te
entering the territory of Victoria aB a matter of
course. Sir George Bowen was Governor
before he left, was Governor whilst absent, and
would have been Governor on his return, his
commission having been neither cancelled nur
withdrawn, but simply suspended as to its
operation during his absence. Not so with
Sir W. Stawell. He ""assumed"" the ad-
ministratorship ; he did not resume it, because
it was not his to resume. He had not held it
before. If he had held it before, and had then
left the colony, and if Sir Redmond
Barry had then become administrator
in his place, there would have been
an analogy between the two cases, and Sir
W. Stawell might have claimed, like the
Governor, the right to resume the powers
which by his absence he had become tempo-
rarily incapable of exercising. As it was,
when he reiurned, he returned as Chief Justice,
not as Acting-Governor. He could not become
Acting-Governor till he was Bworn in. He
could only take office by assumption, not
by resumption, as Sir George Bowen
could. Sir George Bowen, on returning,
would have resumed power as Sir George
Bowen in virtue of a personal appointment
by a commission still operative. Sir W.
Stawell could neither reaBon1 nor assume aa
Sir W. Siawell. lie had not been
personally named in any commission. And the
onl} circumstances under which he could have
claimed a right to assume the administratorship
as Chitf Justice-as the official designated to
fill the vacant office-were manifestly when the
office wat, \acant. But was it vacant? ' !
Ai Sir Rj.dmoîsd Barry was not absent on
Sii W. t>TAWH.L's return, and not suffering
Irom incHpucitv, a vurancy could not have
existid unless he had been deprived of the
office or resigned it. But, having taken the
oaths, «ho was.to deprive him of the office had]
lie chocen to hold it, adopting Marsh ii
MacMamon's motto, ""J'y suts;j'y reslc'1'""
He could have held his footing in
the Malakhofi' agnvnst anybody short
of the Secretary of Stnte. The sup;
position, then, is that ho re_igned.(
But will that resignation hold together on'
being shaken ? When Sir George Bowen
left the colon), he did not resign the Gover-I
nort-hip. He simply went away, and left the
office to fall into the hands of the official first
I in rank designated to fill itj' whensoever
'hat official should he duly eworn in J
[ But Sir Redmond Barky did hot go away.]
If he resigned, he resigned and still
remained, able, if not willing, to discharge the
duties of the office. But had he the powei'
thus to resign and remain? He_ was, bo to,
speak, seised of the business of administration,
and had he a right of his own motion to relieve
himself of it, and hand o\er his duties to
another who, bo long as Sir Redmond was
Acting-Governor, was his subordinate ? If Sir¡
George Bowen had resigned he would have'
sent in his resignation to his superior officer,)
the Secretary of State, and have awaited
his reply. Sir Redmond Barry, derivingj
his authority as Acting-Governor from the
same source, could presumably resign it only
in the same manner. Resignation, apart from
supervening incapacity, implies a reference^
to an authority competent to accept or decline«
it. But there was no such authority in Vic-
toria in Sir Redmond Barry's case. He
could not tender his resignation to the j
Ministry, for their status was not superior;
to his own. When once he had been,
s worn in, they were rather under his
authority than he under theirs. He could not
tender it to Sir W. Stawell, of whom
as defacto Governor, whilst Sir W. Stawell,
was only Chief Justice, he took precedence.'
On the whole, the theory of resignation seems
as little tenable as that of transfer by the mere
force of the commission, which, if our reasoning
be correct, could only have taken place if Sir1
W. Stawell had been the Acting-Governor,
first sworn in, and had returned after a tem-*
porary absence, during which Sir Redmond i
Barry had been his hourn (mens. A j
vacancy might have been created readily]
erpugh, ifSir Redmond Barry, who is now I
in New South Wales, had arranged for an'
earlier i isit, and quitted Victoria the day before '
Sir W. Stawell's arrival, or if the Govern-
ment had delayed swearing in Sir W.
Stawell until after his departure. But he
remained, and the question is, how while he
remained could the office become legally
vacant ? '
It appears to ,us that, just as it was only
though the absence of Sir W. 'Stawell
when an Acting-G o vernon ,was required, that
Sir Redmond Barry obtained the office, bo,
when Sir'Redmond Barry had once obtained
it and been duly sworn in, it was only by his
departure from t the colony, or by supervening
incapacity, that Sir W. Stawell could rightly
assume it. ' Sir Redmond Barry became
Acting-Governor because the swearing
in of an Acting-Governor was requirod
by , the public interest. But no such
necessity aroBe. on the return of Sir
W. Stawell, because the office had been
filled and itB duties were being discharged' in
the manner provided hy the Royal Instructions
und Commission. The provisions of the Com-
mission and the Instructions were intended to
show how a vacant office was to be filled, and
not, when the office had been duly filled, to
create a vacancy in order to substitute another
officer for the one in whom the powers attach-
ing to the position legally vested.
\ Wir at a mine of wealth there would be in the
\inej aids of Australia if only we had a market
I under our lee, such as France has in Europe.
I'the day may come perhaps when in America,
¡if not in Europe,, Australian wines maybe a
popular drink, but at the present time the costs
'of production and carriage aVe against us, and
dhe reputation 'of our vineyards and wine
icellsrs is not high enough, and in the main the
! market for Australian wines is still in Aus-
tralia. *
j As some compensation for the disasters it has
'latelv undergone, France was last year blessed
with an unusually splendid vintage. Notwith-
standing the oidium, notwithstanding the
¡phjlloxera, and notwithstanding hailstorms,
'the vintage was productiv e to an extent which
has only once been equalled, and that was in
¡the year 18G9. The produce is estimated at
170,000,000 of hectolitres, and sr a hectojitre ;s
Twentr-two-1-4 gallons,"" ttíiB'Ms ""s equal1'* to'
1,540,000,000 gallons. The growth of
the trade out of which France makes
so much money will be visible by |
noticing tViat in 1854, that is only twenty years
ago, the product was only eleven millions of
hectolitres; in tho following year it rose to
fifteen; during the eleven years from 1863 to
1878 inclusive, it rose to an average of fifty
three millions ; ""but in 1873, which was a very
bad j ear, it dropped to thirty-six millions, and
now, in the following year, it is very nearly
double, hating risen to seventy millions.
There are only ten departments in France
which produce no wine, and the vine covers
4} per cent, of the whole surface of the
country, or in round numbers about five million
acres. There are, however, three chief wine-
growing districts, namely the Bordelais, Bur-
gundy, and Champagne, and the produce from
those districts has not yet been rivalled by any
other part of the world. The number of
people employed in thia industry is in propor-
tion to the acreage covered, for it is reckoned
to give occupation to no fewer than seven
million labourers ; that is to say, one industry
in .France alone, and that an industry which
produces an article of luxury, finds wages for
more than three times the whole population of
Australasia. '
Nor is there any fear at present of France
over-producing. There is an indefinite market
for all the good wine that is made, although it
is possible that a great or sudden glut might to
some extent lower the price, in order to allow
.-?ales to be effected rapidly. But in its wine
Fiance has an article which tbe world
eagerly buys ; and, as the world is grow-
ing richer every year, and becoming more
and more luxurious, there is more and
more eager demand for wines of the' best
quality. In this way, France is taxing the
whole world to help it to pay its debts ; and
everyone who sips his claret or his champagne
assists towards the pa} ment of that satisfaction'
which Bismarck and Von Moltkk exacted. <
It is impossible not to notice in this yield of
(he French vineyards how much the commerce
of the world has gained by the greater humanity
of modern methods of war. When we read
ancient history, we hear of conqueTorB who
..eemtd insatiable in their revenge, who razed
cities to the ground, and who ploughed up the
cultivated fields and sprinkled them with salt.'
and who seemed never to be able to do enough
lo tatisfy themselves that the people who had
piovoked their wrath should be ruined hope-
lessly. If the samo spirit had animated modern
war-if the Germans, not content with conqu_
luig, had sought only to devastate-if they,
had pulled up the vines and destroyed
the wine-presses, in how different a
situation would France have been! How
heavy would have been the pressure of
the taxation, and how cramped the resources
lo meet that taxation. What numbers would
have been out of employment, and what years
would have been waited by capitalists till vines
could have been replanted and again become
productive ! But, as it was, the German occu-
pation did. not appreciably affect the vintage,
which even, during the disastrous year of thç
war kept up its''average. <** * ,
It is quite true that this more humane pian
mils the conqueror quite as well as it suits* thfct
conquered. The victor takes it out in monej
inptead of having his payment in revenge. lV
Geimany had destroyed the productive industij'
of France, it would have had to content itself
with a far smaller indemnity. The credit of
France would have been too prostrate for it io
have raised the necessary loans with the'
promptness that it did, and Germany i1-'
iewar.de,d for not having destroyed French ¡
vineyards by the receipt of hundreds of million«
of French gold. Doubtless to a Christian
spiiit this mode of reí enge is more satisfactory,
and to the wine-drinkers of the world it is moie
satisfactory also.
It is impossible also in connection with this
subject not to notice how much of the wealth ',
of France is due to it being a producer for the
luxury of the world. In the way of exporting
the necessaries of life it does not do mucn,.
and produces mainly for its own popu-
lation. It exports but little of com' or of
meat ; but with regard to all that comforts the
stomach or adorns the person, France stands
in the first rank of producers. It is the grand
purveyor of luxury, and, in a world that is
getting every year richer and more luxurious,
it does not fail to find a splendid market.
France, though it has no monopoly of the busi-
ness in luxuries, has the undisputed lea-1.
Italy provides many objects of art, and English
manufacturers are improving yearly in tbiii
productions of taste and ingenuity. Still it is to
France that the world turns for models and foi
its choicest objets de luxe; and there seems no
likelihood ' of its pre-eminence in this depart
ment being interfered wi li. The French
manipulators seem to have as great an aptitude
for work of this sort as their soil and climate
have aptitude for a special class of wines. The
commercial position of France in these respects
| brings it wealth, in spite of all its foreign wai s
and its intestine discords, and of the damage in-
evitably done to trade when capital is alarmed
by insecurity and labour is oppressed bj
taxation.

Now South Wales.
To Speculators in Victoria and the other colonies.
AN ELIGIBLE INVESTMENT,
is now ofleied in tho pinchase of the undermentioned Gold
Mining Propeity submitted for POSITIVE SALE, in
consequence of the general depiossion in mining matters in
this colony, and the consequent inability to raise further
funds for tho economical and eficctive working thereof,
the whole original capital having been expended in the
purchase and erection of the complote and thorough work-
ing plant, and in other costly but necessary preliminary
details. ' '
CHARLES CROPFER and CO. have re-

tion Act' of 1866, together with tho valuable plant
and machinery erected thereon,
Tho 2.3-ACRE LEASE has 1800 foot on tbo course of
the îeef known as "" White's,"" and was worked some years
ago in block claims. Several thousand tons at that tima
were flushed from them,yielding from Gdwts. to 3 oz., and
by reference to tho engine books it is shown to havo resulted
in an average throughout of 1 oz. to the ton. Sixty feet
was the maximum depth reached, and at that lovel water
was met with in such quantities as preoludod further work
without the aid of such powerful machinery as has been
erected by the presont Company ; and Binco that time 439
tons of quartz only havo been raised, giving 235 oz. of
gold.
A MAIN SHAFT, 9 foot 3 inches x 3 feot 6 inches in
the ileai, has been sunknenrly in the centro of the ground
to a depth of 97 feot, divided into two winding compart-

down, und the hauling is done by a 10-horse power por-
table t-ngino, by Ransome and Sims, fitted with link
motion tor reversing, with winding drums, wiro ropes, and
everything required for its effective working; tho trucks
holding la cwt. of Btono. Four hundred feet on tho
southern side of thiB shaft aro now let on tributo, tha
tributéis biking 624 per cent., and tho company the re-
mainder. Tho agreement expires on the 28th of Juno next. *
Another 400 adjoining, on the north, aro about being let,
the ti ¡bitters by their agreement being bound to equallyjhaul
free of ixpense fi oin both. The termination of tbo oon
tine Is M ill be on the same day.
'Hie MACHINERY at No. 1 abaft consists of a 30
horfe power horizontal ongino, with two Cornish boilers,
each 20 feet 6 inches x 5 feet, and brisk stack 40 foot high,
driviup: a battery of 15 head of stampers and pumps for
mnin shaft, twith T bob and all bob mountings, connecting'

No. 1 shaft goes direct from the cages to it. Thero ara
250 feet of C-incb cast iron discharge pipos, one 8-inoh
' plunger pump, and one S-inch lift pump, together with

| engino, fitted with link motion tor revorsing and receiving
steam flinn one of tho largo boilors ; tho barrels, ropes, &o.,
i aro ¡u first-rate ordor. Engine-house and buildings covered
,' with galvanized iron. The ostimatcd cost of Binking th»
' main shaft to tho reef is £650 ; and were this done, and the
mino opened out there, the presont expongo of working the
i No. 2 shaft, carting Btone to the battery, &c, involving;
about 8s 4d a ton would bo saved, and from 120 to 130 tona
eould be easily raised a-weok, fully employing tho battery ;
the actual expenso of crushing at winch has nover cost the
! prêtent company more than 3s 4d per ton.
; The Auctioneers believe that tho judicious expenditure of
a comparatively small outlay upon this property would
j piovo highly remunerativo, and invite an inspection of it,
for which purposo abundance of time has boen purposely
given, confident that such will do more to establish tha
' truth of what they now assort than anything thoy might
j write in support of suoh a statement.
I Tht Mino has been tested to no appreciable depth, nor
, bas iinv attention been bestowed upon the numerous other

The death of Mr. Maurice Nathan, of
this town, removes from our midst one of the
oldest merchant pioneers of the Coast.
Qeneralregrot was expressed on Thursday lint
when |it beaame known that he had suddenly
taken seri'iusly ill from some throat affec-
tion, but it caine as a, very painful surprise to
those who knew lum when told on Saturday
morning that on the previous «vening he had
passed to his last rest. Mr.Nathanfiist became
connected with the various interests of the J
North-West Coast close on 40 years ago,
wheo he established himself os a general
dealer at Fort Sorell before Latrobe had
become the business centre. He eventually
removed to Latrobe, commencing business
as a general storekeeper in premises adjoin- j
ing the old Commercial Bank, which he sold
subsequently to Messrs. E. ana W. L.
Bartlett.proceeding theucoto Launceitonaud
Melbourne, returuîug to Latrobe some
six or seven years ago, again setting up
business as wine and spirit und produce
merchant in premises built for his oivn use,
but which he retired from list year. He
was appointed a Justice of the Peace for
Latrobe during 1887, and was one of the
best attende» to the various duties such
appointment imposed upon him. The de-
ceased leaves no family, and was S3 years of
age at the time of his death, his widow being
a sister of the Messrs. Bartlett of this town.
During his long business career he bas
become known to pretty well all who reside
in the district, and general regret will be
expressed at the news of his demise.
The manager of the U.A A.A. is evidently
bent upon making the forthcoming exhibi-
tion u gigantic success. Ho lus just re-
ceived a letter from Nick Long, editor of tho
Olympian, California, with extracts from
I that and other papers, publiabin-* a chal-
lenge for £300 to the champion axe-
men of the United States und Canada,
and stating that the challenge had
been Bent to the various lumber
districts of Michigan, Wisconsin, Cali-
fornia and Canada, also stating tout an
effort was being made to secure the entry
of J. A Muiray, of Vancouver, the champion
axeman of Canada, for the forthcoming con-
tests, which take place in November.
lu all probability an entry will be received

ZEEHAN, Sunday,
At the Oonah 92$ to-..s of firat-class ore
were weighed and sampled on Saturlay,
representing the output for the week. Hie
stones aie looking ui well as usual, and a
little ore is heginning to make in the south
e id on the bottom level, which hau for some
time been in blank ground, but is now near
ing the second ore shoot,
At the Tuimanian Crown the work of
driving the crosscut from the main «halt at
the first level is now proceeding, about 20ft.
hiving been advanced ingoodoountry. No.
2 vertical «baft is down 48ft., and will be
pushed on a« fait a« possible. A Din.
Cornish lift ha« been substituted for the
«maller one, and the eouneetion with tbe
pumping engine and the main «haft by
which it i« driven ii being so altered a« to

allow of a 5ft. Gin. stroke being,uied without
interfering with the stroke of the main pump,
which it only 3ft. Giu. Owing to, the diffi
0'iltiet experienced through running ground
of tapping the lode at the second level the
intention now is to endeavour to unwater
the country overhead by opening oat on the
tint level, aud to sink No. 2 shaft as deep
as possible to act at a drainage shaft, teeing
that the accumulation nf tlurry prevents the
water running freely in the main workings,
By this meant it it hoped alto that the influx
of slurry, at the second level will be prevented
or minimised, A second prospecting shaft hat
tyan started some dittance north on m large

TO TUB I3DIT01I t)P THU HltltAI.I).
Su IJiav e read with that tttentivc consideration to
which any BtttrAnenfunder the hand of my excellent
and learned friend Mr Alexander Gordon, ib entitled,
the letter which appeared in the Harold ol Saturday
last, on the subject of Orange Asspciationa, and I
desire to ¿tate candidly what effect it has had upon
my own mind and what I believe will be its general
c fleet
That I may not be supposed to be a bigot, in-
capable of calm and rational investigation of the
subject, I may as well say at the outset that I am not
an Orangeman (unless, indeed, to be an honest and
consistent Protestant, a loyal subject, and a good
citizen be the principal elements ot Orangeism), nor
have I ever been a member of any secret society what
ever I have never had a difference with any man on
the subject of his religion, nor ia the ordinary trans
actions of life, or in giving assistance or employment
have I ever been influenced bj the consideration
whether the parties were Protestant or ltomarust
I or the last fifteen years and upwards, I have con
tinuousiy had in my service th.ee or more Roman
C athohes, and I liiv e never made inquiry on the sub
lect of their religion, except for the purpose of afford
uif, them convenient and regular opportunity of
ittendiH¿ confession and the public sen ices of their
Church
But although I am not a member of any Orango
Association there arc icisons which compel me to
look into the evidence upon which the objections to
0nnoei»m are founded, and to be well satisfied as to
their validity betöre I can concur in the denunciation
of suth institutions
It is an luidoubted fact beyond any doubt or
question, that the Orange Associations havo at all times
included amongst their members noblemen, gentlemen,
mid clergymen of every Protestant denomination,
whose learning, ability, pietv, punt) of life liberality
chant) and brotherly kindness to men of every creed
have never been exceeded and I will not I dare not
ujrn the word of any min or upon any re oin
tton of my Parliament or Assembly m the
we riel, withe ut the most eonvmciii¿ evidence
believe tint nil these learned most excellent
dud tmly good men were 6o blinded by bigotry tint
they bec une nul tontimud îiieiiibeis of an associa
non whose amis and objects mid princioles were
vvholh opposed to the teaching of that pure uid holy
religion vi Inch they professed
Hie knovvledae ol the character of such men has
iceustomed me to look upon Oringe ass îeiitions as
religious, loyal and most reputable societies entitled
to the respect and confidence of all good men ind
e&i coally of all t,ood Protestants and unless my
gre itly rcspeettd lnend is able to show that there is
something inherently wrong m the principles of the
institution-th it it is in some respecta opposed to the
te tching of that Church of which he is so distill
gunhctl and useful i member th it it acknowledges
prn eiples or requires approves of, 01 permits in its
ii embers conduct opposed ti the teaching ofthat
Book winch they recognise ns their only rule of faith
I must continue to reDird them with the sime
feelings of respect and confidence is I h eve done
hitherto
It is timte possil le that I m ty hal c very erroneous
»lews of the pin tq les and objecte, of Ornveism but
it so I shall afioril my esteemed fnenel an opportu
nity of setting me right
It is to bo regretted th it instead ef setting before
yrur readers extricts which afford no inform tuon, he
ebel i ot tell them whit Orangeism really is-what are
it« pnneiples ind the objects it is designed to
ucee i push-that he ebel not listinctly point out
v\l at there is in it tint is opposed to he dictates ot
our common Christianity, to loy alt) to our beloved
Queen, and to our dutv as good eiti/ens If he hid
eloi e this, and I had been convmeed that the state
nicnts were-»veil founded I should have |omeel him
nie st hcartilv, and done ill in my power to dis
teuragethem But it is useless for Mr Gordon to
tell any intelligent and thinking men, who know tho
history of the misgov eminent of Ireland foi the 1 ist
century, that it has been the vvcik, vacilUum0 mis
tiktn and miserable policy of a government who,
ben "" incapable of dealing with the gnev mees thtt
leallv existed soubht from time to time to appease
the clamour of the Horn mists, which they could
not otherwise sitisfy by trying ulmost beyond human
eneluraneo, the loyalty and obedience to law of the
1 rotcstants of that country until at length, by their
last act of despoiling them of that property which the
¡state never gave, thev haye aroused i spirit which
they -will lind it difficult to allay Let me brmg
under the notice of Air Gordon the language of our
own beloved and truly Piotcstant Bishop in his last
charge, where, in speaking of the Irish Church, he
says -
W c in this colony shall not be unmindful that we
arc raerrber3 of the United Church ol Lngland and
Ireland, and shall, I trust, remember the Irish
portion of the United C burch ol England in our
prayers Lvil times have come upon it, and a
Chinch which in these later years has borneare
mul ibte and faithful witness *o the truth ii i/i
ilanyti of being sacrificed io gratify personal and
j olitical ambition The people oj Ireland have no juU
i une of complaint against the /ruh ( huron Roman
tallolits did net Jound it Roman Catholics do not
¡ian lain it and while the proposed disen
dowment of the Irish Church is uuconsti
tutioi al and dii/onest, it is also a mistaken
and useless surrender of a scriptural institution, in
the vain hope ot propitiating an implacable toe le is
i ""rent national calamity Sion of high character and
ot undoubted benevolence are ally ing themselves to
the idolatrous sy stem of the Church of Home, and are
thus making 'hat possible which without their aid
eould never have been accomplished Hie plea is
that Ireland may be pacified Ireland would be at
i cet it aDitatois would allow her to be so One w ould
think that his'orv had never been wntten Did the
Church of Home ever willingly accept any articles of
peace but those which gave lier the entire supremacy
of nund, and soul, anti body Did any pokey ot
conciliation ever satisfy that Cnurch, or was not that
which was granted made the basis of fresh demands
""What solemn vows and promises were heard when
the repeid ot Romish disabilities was sought ' what
confident hopes expressed-as, for example, by the
late Dr Clialuiers, who is reported to have said,
' lhat, with the Bible in one hand and the Roman
Catholic Relief Bill in the other, Ireland would
speedily be conv erted to the Protestant faith
It would have been cantUd if Mr Gordon had told
us that which is as much a certain matter ot his
tory as the Parliamentary speeches and lcsolutions to
which helios refirred-that the Orange associations
had then origin tit necessity, foi the purpose of
defence, and have never been tggressive
Allison, in lus 'History of Luiope, says, "" there
was this essential difference uetweeii the Orangemen
and the I mteil Inshmen-the combination of the
Oranqcmtn was defensive, induced by necessity, that of
tie Catholics aggtesitie, stimulated by an.bitton lheie
is nothing, however, m Mr Gordon s letter that I so
much regret as the inference he desires to be drawn
from the conduct of Colonel I airman va. refusing to
give up the books with which he had been
confidentially entrusted I believe the infer
euee to be most ui lair, nnd entirely unvvar
ranted In his lefusal he did piecisely
what anv honourable man voultl do-what Mr
Gordon w oultl do ui bimilar cireums'ances Suppose
the Gr mel Master of the Freemasons were ordered by
oui Legislative -Vsaembly to give up the books of the
Ordei, and divulDc to the world those tlun0s which
v» ere intended to be kept from all but the initiated,
does mv fnend believe it possible that any amount of
threats or punishment would lead to compliance
lhc question Mr Gordon proposes is-If it was
right and proper to dissolve these associations in
Lngland and Iieland in lSe¡6, why are thev to exist in
l8 el and m this colony My niisuci is that there
are good and suibeient reasons for theu continuance
that there are the same reasons-but in a tenfold
aggravated form-foi the existence of Oiangeism.thut
induced the late able and v cnerable Dr Chalmers, in
the last few y ears of lus lite to believ e in the neces
sitv lor the establislunent ot the Lv angelical Alliance,
whose pnneiples and objects were the same It is
well known that that eminent divine was not an
opprctsoi of Romanists, but that, on the contrary,
lie battled for them most valiantly endeavouring to
secuie Catholic emancipation and y et when addiess
ing the G encrai Assembh in Glasgow in the v car l8 lo
he concluded his speech on Chinitian umem with these
| words-'And 1 just conclude with observing that
now is the time to rally about the common standard

is that vv o bhall h iv e to make head a""ainst a new fonn
and revival of Antichrist, whethei m the form
ofl'operv-n ikeel Pupcix-or Popery m disguise -
even that Antichrist which tia eatons to bhake a most
witheimg mildew over the whole ol Christendom
lwo xears later in lfelo (and within two years of the
close ot his honouied and useful life), when he felt
elie nceeseitv for the combination of Prot»stants
without retjUid to forms of Church government, he bj
a pamphlet promoted the establishment ol ' the
Alliance, from w Inch 1 desire to give one or two
exti lets, which I believe as truly and definitely set
forth the principles of Orangeism and the justification
tor their existence as the principles anil objects oí the
""Alliance, with which I bébete it is thoroughly
identified m all its pnneiples lu that pam.«
phlet Dr. - Chalmers' write«-"" Wa feet all euh
ÎTelèncc irï rctomniending that they should stand
forth in 'the character first Of a great anti-Popish
association, and secondly of a great homo mission,
believing, as ive do, that to walk together in the field
erf Christian philanthropy is a likely preparation for
thinking together on the questions of Christian faith.""
As serving to mark moro distinctively what he con-
ceived should be the primary object of the institution,
he proposed that it should be ejalled ""The PaoTBfl
tant"" rather than the Evangelical Alliance; and,
after describing the benefit which might arise from
this change of name in the way of warding off the
perplexities which might arise from any attempt to
define the evangelical doctrine so as to obtain for the
definition a universal concurrence, he proceeds thus :
-"" There is another argument in favour of our pro-
posed title. Its single watchword not only describes
very clearly the qualifications of the proposed mem-
bership, but it intimates, with equal clearness, what
the precise work is in which, when brought together
and formed into au association, they are expected to
engage. It is an alliance in defence of Pro-
testantism. Where there is no danger to be warded
off, there might be no reason in pleading for such an
association as we now advocate, or for its title either.
But who can deny the existence of a most imminent
and daily increasing danger r Who eau be ignorant
of the bus}- aggressive proselytism and undermining
policy that are now in active operation, under the
conduct of agents and emissaries from the Church of
Kome? Who can be blind to the evidences now
springing up in vnrious lands, that the old priestcraft
of the Middle Ages is lifting its head again, and
shedding baleful influence over Churches that were
wont to boast of theirs being the foremost place, and
theirs the first-rate services in the cause of the
glorious Reformation ! Whether the Antichrist that
is now reappearing be in the ancient and unmitigateel
torm of Popery, cr in the no less dangerous though
milder form of Puscyism (in these days he would
Write liitualisw), surely there is most urgent call
for vigilance and alarm ; and, should it be made tho
first and most ostensible object of the Alliance to repel
the inrcads of this threatening mischief, ive are con-
fident, if such an undertaking were to give
forth its certain sound, that thousands
¡ind tens of thousands would hasten to
its summons, in the sacred cause of religious freedom,
and Scriptural Christianity, and the rights of private
judgment. It will be miserable indeed, if the hostile
demonstrations from without do not lead us to look
outwardly; or if we shall waste our energies on the
yet premature attempt to settle the account between
the various modifications and distinctions of Pro-
testantism, when the common enemjr is at the door,
and if not met with a systematic and combin'd reiistan<~c,
might bury Protestantiim, throughout all its varieties, in
one common »«in. We tell of a distinct thing to be
dene, and a distinct thing to correspond about, when
we state how desirable it is to ascertain the statistics
of Popery all over the world, and more especially the
statistics of Puseyism and High Churchism (Ritu-
alism)-these great feeders of Popery in our Island ;
anel furthermore, when we state as most fitting objects
for deliberation, what the best methods aro by which
to arrest the progress of the threatening mischief, not
only at home, but in America and the British colonies,
and the continent of Europe, and every other place
where Jesuitism is playing her wiles, and practising
with deadly success her manifold elelusions. Anei
reverting to our own affairs, as well as making an ad
vance from deliberations to doings, what more patent
than the various methods by which our literary and
ecclesiastical and influential men might arouse the Pro
\ testant community of Great Britain, and put our contti
tuincKS on the alert ; and also funds for the niultipli
I eation of scriptural schools, aud outrival our adver-
saries, who at this moment are labouring with all
| their might to obtain possession of the masses by their
linn earied attentions in the houses of the common
| pctiple, and doing whatever in them lies to influence and
Kain 01 cr our heretofore sadly-neglected population.""
These ure what I understand to be the principles and
objects of Ornngeism-and if they are, I say to the
Orangemen-go on and prosper-be true to your
principles-true to your Bible-loyal to your Queen
-obedient to the laws-and brotherly affectioned to
all men of every creed, and you need not fear attacks
from any quarter. It is quite certain that the ranks
of the institution will be increased more by the
slanders of false brethren than Irom any other cause.
I know of nothing which aroused the feeling of quiet
soberminded Protestants so much, as the fact of a man
who calls himself a member of the Church of England
daring in the Legislative Assembly to compare
Orangemen with Fenians.
Believing that I have truly stated the principles of
Orangeism, and the only objects they have in view,
I must say that I never have been able to understand
how it is that loyal subjects of her Majesty-and
above all, men who are sincere Protestants-could
apply such rancorous language and such insulting
epithets as have been applied to those whose only
crime is that they dare to keep in remembrance
and to celebrate those great evento which enabled the
i late accomplished Lord Macaulay to write, "" It is
* because we had a preserving revolution in the seven
i teenth century, that, we have not had a destroying
' revolution in the nineteenth. It is because we had
j freedom in the midst of servitude that we have order
I in the midst of anarchy. Por the authority of law,
for the security of property, for the peace of our
\ streets, for the happiness of our homes, our gratitude
is duo under IIi.m who raises and pulls down nations I
at his pleasure-to the Long Parliament, to the Con
vention, and to William of Orange."" I
I will conclude by simply stating it as my deliberate
conviction^that if I had a desire to become an Orange-
man, there is nothing in Mr. Gordon's letter that
would cause me to pause for an hour, and I predict
that it will lead fifty persons to join for one it will
deter from becoming connected' with the Orange
1 Association.
With thanks for your kind permission,

Pursuant to tho Order of Iho Day,
The Bov. A H. t>TE. HEN moved that tho Tribunal
Ordinnnco bo now read a third time.
Mr. DAHLE\ moved that tho third reading be postponed
fill tho next session of the Synod. Ho could scarcely con-
ceive anything likely to bo more disastrous than hasty
legislation on thin subject, and it appeared to him that they
had run too rapidly through the measure to give it all tho
consideration its grcut importance demanded. By tho 20th
section of the Church Temporalities Aot, the Bishop of
S)dney had power, on caune shown, to revoko the license
of ntlergjmnn, indeed, bo took it, this was the section
which gavo the Bishop general control over the clergy of
bia diocese It was now, howevor, proposed to
create a new tribunal for the trial of cloigy,
not only for ordinary offences, but for doctrinal
offences. Ho ventured to say that not five members of tho
¡>) rod appreciated duly the importance of the stop thus
Icing taken The establishment of a tribunal like this re-
quired tome little the/Ught before n woll matured decision
eouldbe arrived at AB the law now stood, tho Bishop of I
h)dEoy was the tribunal for tho trial oi theso offences, and
it was sought to tako that power from him Why such
hnsto 5 Hid thoBishop exorcised unduo proesuroupon tho
elerey, or had bo on uny occasion failed in his dut) by
making inquiry, or bj ubBtaining from inquiry, as to
i ffences - lhcro were two or three points in this measure
that required the gruv est consideration. 1 ho third clauto
wns the key of the whole bill. It bad boon thought advis-
able that this power should be taken from the Bishop, and
be vested m a tribunal If thon it was advisablo to take
away this power from tho Bishop, why give the Bishop (as
wus provided in the first portion of this clause) the right of
an absoluto veto, whether a tlerg)uian should be tried or
not ? Here was a condition procèdent whereby tho aotion
of the tribunal might bo actually barrod. Hereafter wo
might hnvo bishops of opinions stronger or weaker than
thoso held by our present Bishop, some of whom
un¡,ht regard as importnnt mature what others looked upon
an trivial, and it win, posible that complaint might properly
be made against a ulcrg) man on a question oi elactnno,
when a.bithop would veto the charge on tho ground that tne
doctrino complained of was held b) himself, but ostensibly
cn tho ground of unimportance He (Mr. Darley) was
quite willing (hat tho pou or should be vosted as now in tho
hands of the Bishop, bul if ho woro to be deprived of it, do
not let bim have the right to bar tho action of tho tribunal
to which his power was transferred This peint did not
oppear to havo received any consideration at their hands.
Ly tho next clause it was provided that "" if the onmmittoe
shall report that thero is not sufficient ground for the charge
made npainst the accused olerg)mnu, then the Bishop may
uletain from taking anv furiher proceeding in the matter.""
Hero nn absoluto discretion was vested in tho Bishop, and
ho might, m spito of the committee's report, proceed
against theclerg)man Theeowere two matters of princi-
ple which did not seem to have boen propsrly considered
J here also appeared to be «overol oversights-first, in not
catrying the amendment in clause 7 into clause 8, whore it
w OB equally necessary. He had in practice seen tho disas-
trous effects of banty and crudo legislation, and they ought
to bear in mind tho possibility of some question in rcferonco
to the provisions contained in this ordinance being brought
btforo the Supremo Court The 9th clause provided that,
""If mont cose the accused clorgymanehall rofuso or neg
bet to appear either in person or by counsel or agent m
obedience to the citation BO issued and served on him as
hereinbefore mentioned, tho Tribunal ahall proceod so hoar
the cause in his absence "" Tho condition precedent was
refusal or neglect, there waa no provision in referonce to
occident, or inability on account of ill health No doubt it
was provided that a new trial nug) t be granted m case
juaneo required it, but it would be a mee question for tho
judges to decide whether what had taken place
in the nbsenco of the accused could be regarded
as a trial or not, when that absence was unavoidable,
and whether in case of future proceedings they could be
regarded OB a second trial. It might be said this ordinance
was in effect tho copy or transcript of an ordinance in an-
other colony, still he conceived that it had not yet received
all the requisite consideration. Why take these powers
from the Bishop and veBt thom in another tribunal, which
hod no precedent in any other colony or m tho mother
ciunlry-("" Oh, oh "")-consisting of laymen andclericj-a
tribunal whose functions were not to bo exercuod unless
the Bishop gave leovo ' He moved that the third reading
be postponed, in order that membeis might bave timo to
consider tho principles upon which tho measure res'ed,
Tho Rev. Conon AILWOOM seconded tho mot on.
The Rev A H STEPHEN hoped the Synod would hast-
íate-before acceding to the motion With regard to the
otjection raised as to hasty legislation, it ought to be borne
in mind that this was not an experiment, and it would bo
found that the very points of principio to which Mr Darley
teok exception were contained m the English Church
Disciplino Act, from which the comunttoo copied
largely. With regard to the Synod being too
eager to transfer the power which the Bishop had
under Iho Church 1 eraporahties Act, the learned gentle-
men muBt have forgotten a decision of tho Supreme Court,
to which an appeal was modo a few years back, when it
nae decided that tho Bishop had no power to constitute
tuen a tiibunol na that by wbieh the appealing olorgyman
bid been tried Iho Svnod now had power unaor her
I galised constitutions to relieve the Bishop lrom a position
which all understood to bo distasteful to him Of tho two
instances in which the learned member objected
to prinnples in tho measure, precedents existed
in the English Act which had stood the test
of experience and which had been adopted by
the Australian Synods It seemed strango too that with a
complaint against depriving the Bishop of tho power ho
poetessed there should be associated an objection to the
discretion this bill gave to the Bishop That discretion
was allowed in the Church Discipline Act to anv English
Bishop With regard to the oversight referred to in clause
8 tho learned gentleman would perceive, on reading both
clauses, that tho amendment m the 7th was not required in
the 8th clause Then, agnn, in the Oth clause tho learned
gentleman said there was no provision made for cases of
absence through accident The last lino of tho 8th clause
cured any defect of that kind Every clause and line ot
tho measure bad been carefully considered, and he hoped
the Synod would not, unless much weightier reasons were
eli own, consent to tho postponement proposed
The Bov H A PALMEII supported the amendmont and
signified bis approval oi what the mover thereof had said
with regard to hasty legislation He thought thoy had
not sufficient time to consider tho matter, and as m the
divison on tho 8th clause nearly half the clergy present had
voted against it, ho thought that to ask for a postponement
was not too much, more especially as that clause deeply
affected the interests of the clergy Whatever might be the
inherent excellences of tho bill he would like to see it re
jeeted rather than that clause should pass The 8th
clauee was like the dead fly which made the whole of the
ointment unsavoury (Hear, hear, and laughter ) The
mover ol the bill had said that it was taken from an
English model but bad forgotten that there the law
referred to tbo vvholo of the English diocese, so that
there could bo no différence between the tribunals
If we could have a law hero which would be binding on
the whole of the tribunals it might be of advantage, but I
hero wo had a tribunal of one kind in one dioco«e and 1
another tribunal of quite a different character in another, j
so that the Church here might come to bo regarded as a I
divided Church administering matters of doctrino and
ritual in different ways and deciding upon quite different
standards of faith He did hope that the matter would
be postponed until next session , if not, he must ask leavo
to liter his bumble protest against the eighth clause
The amendment waa thon put, and declared to be
negatived
Mr DAHLEN called for a division, amid cries oí ' Too

The BISHOI You eau divide on tho thud reading
Mr DAULEV wished to divide on the amendment
Tho BISHOP Eut the amendment is lost
Mr It JONES submitted that the division ought to bo
taken.
Iho Bisiior Well, there will be a division at one time
or the other, and we may as well take it at once
Mr BABKBE submitted that a division could not be
taken on tho amendment, as the division had not been
called for until the president had actually proceeded to state
the next question
[ Tbo BISHOP It appears to me that it ¡will be merely
deferring the division, and we may aa well take it now.

THE MA1UUAOF QUEBTION
Tbo DTAN oi SIDNEY rose to move (ho adoption of the
report of the committee on tbo Marriage question Since
bo gato notice of this motion, which ho was permitted to
lioonltidny evening, it bad been suggested to him that
the moro convenient way of discussing the whole matter
would bo by the Synod resolving itself into a committee cf
the wholo to ce nsider tho report With tho permission of
the Synod, he moved "" That his Lordship leave the chair,
and the Synod resolve itsolf into a committee of the whole
to consider the recommendations of the report ""
Mr RICHARD JONES seconded the motion, which was
put and passed, and the Synod went into committee
The DFAN or SIDNEY then said that ho rose for the
purpose oi rawing certain resolutions foundod upon the
recommendations of the Committeo's report upon the mur-
ringo queelton, and before he proceeded to move theBe
resoiutionp, it would, perhaps, be expected of him to give
some explanation of the grounds on which tho Committee
had arrived at their conclusions The members of the
St nod bad had the report m their hands for eovoral days,
and it might bo expected that they had made themselves
acquainted with lis contente Ho trusted that it was BO ,
that the report bad been carefully read and considered, for
if it had been, that circumatanco would much facilitate the
Lusineea before them He would, however, mako a few
explanatory observations with reference to the matters
contained in the report It would be observed by tho com
inittto that the clergy had reported various causes ua having
ltd to the dccrenfe~in the number of mnrriogos celebrated
[ ly the clergy of the Church of England, and ho regretted
to say that this diminution bad gone on increasing during
tho post 3ear, for he found that the number
of marnagea celebtated by the clorgy of the
Church of England in this colony dunn g
1PGG v os thirty lesa thamnl8G5 Thisdecreaso was, how-
ever, not so v try great, e onMdenng that tbo total decrease
in the number of marriages bad been also great But there
vue one consideration which ho thought should hftvo con
e-ielcrable weight with the clergy and laity, vi/ , that un
lerfector cironcous opinions with regard io Iho marriage
Tito WOB one great caupe which led to the diimuutiou, and
vhith had led to it in this ws)-from a desire to be married
in private If the divine institution of marriage nnd ils
clinrnctcr were duly considered, and the solemn responsibi
hues connected -with that Holy Ordinance were connilered,
people would not desire this privacy Thoy would feel that
tbcro was nothing to bo BBhamed of, they would think
tjnt they were going about a very honourable
thing,-would desire their friends to be acquainted with
what thej were going to do, und would not wish to onter
Fecretly that hoi) stato which vi OB instituted by God at the
lepinning of man s eMBtence, and which Scripture bud said
tr Lo honourable in nil and symbolical of Christ s Church
He did hofatbat tbo clergy would consider this carelully
Pn bablv they had been to blamo in not endeavouring to
inform their people on thiB suljtct Ho saw no better way
e t benefiting them than by informing them of tho ov ii and
giving them more correct views A number of reasons
were, given ne to the causes which had led to thedeciease
111 ken of, and amongst them was ono he would refer to,
viz, the facilities afforded for prívalo marriages
Ho had co doubt that the ministrations of
LIB brethren had brought under their notice painful
citcum«-tanceB of this nature He remembered one instance
cf a young woman leaving the house in which she was a
sei vont-ueking permission to go out and seo a friend
HermistrcES wos sick in bed , her master was aw ay from
bone, and she did not return until II o'clock at night,
when ehe told her mistress that sho was married Ho
knew of other persons having been married in the same
hiiMv manner. TheEe wero evils, however, that could
bat di) be rectified without an alteration in the marriage
lim of the colony A great numbor of recommendations
had been made by clergymen, in reply to questions pro
pofcd to them, and ho would mention them as they were
pieced before tho Sjnod in tho report. Some proposed
» i eduction of the marriage fees, others tho abolition
of fees altogether Others proposed that banns
t-hculd bo dispensed with altogether, and others that licenses
bhould be dispensed with altogether. But the most im
rortant recommendation, and one which seemed moro
likdy than any other to havo a practical result was that
the hours should te extended to 8, or half past 8 o'clock, in
the evening. He might state that that recommendation
proceeded frem a number of clergvmen, some of whom had a
ci risiderable experience in the colony, and appeared to have
given the matter a great deal of careful consideration
Another tery important recommendation contained in these
icpheB of the clergy was with reference to the necessity
for persons being married in the church of the
parish in which one of tho parties resided. This
WSB a question which he hoped the committee
would consider very carefully, and be prepared
to deal with after that careful deliberation that it deserved,
1er his own part, he must eay that he was acquainted with
e number of cases m which a great hardship had been felt
1 y perEons who wiBhod to be married in another church than
i but of their own pariBh. There were, it was true, moana
sf getting over this great difficulty. Persons giving notioe
ot their intention of being married in a particular church
nnd going to reside for a short time-sovondajs- m tho
(arish to which that church belonged, could obtain their
desire Ho knew of such cases ""Very strong feelings had
existed, and be might cay prejudices entertained and unkind
fedings generated, by this res notion , and ho did not
wonder that the clergy ana tomo of them strongly, pro
poied the abolition of this restriction Passing from these
general observations, with reference to the cau«0B
ned tbe remedies, he carne to the proposition of the first of
these resolutions, and the resolution he had now to submit
to the committee was as follows -""That this Synod
having under consideration the report of the committee
appointed by the Synod to inquire into the causes which
have operated to bring about tho large diminution which
bos taken place in the number of marriages celebrated by
the clergy of the Church of England m this diocese, and
to consider and report what measures it is advisable to adopt
vnlh a view to remedy the evils resulting from members of
the Church resorting to ministers of other denominations to
le matried, resolve that it is expedient -Tirat, that all
fetB now charged m connection with the celebration of
nmiriBge, whether by banns or license, bo abolished.'1
Members would observe that this stood number one on the
recommendations of the committee, and he now proposed
them as resolutions of the Synod. It had appeared to the
coii.mitteo who bad charge of this measure not
desirable that tbe fees should be diminished, as
that would hardly meet tho difficulties of the
case, but cons'dered it would bo preferable
to abolish all compulsory payment of fees whether the inar
iicgo were celebrated by banna or license, and that persons
con ing lo the celebration of the mnrnago rito should merely
make wbat voluntary offerings they choto upon the occa
tun. Ho believed that would be a wiso courso AB we
n ode no charge for baptism and other rites of tho Church,
he thought people should receiv e this nie without being
compelled to pay for it It would remove difiiculties out of
the way, and would draw numbers to tho Church to be
married if all the fee6 they were required to pay before tho
celebration of tho marriage were abolished Of course ho
WOB aware that certain expenses were paid by means of these
feet-that out of them a certain provision was made for the
salaries of tho registrar of the diocese, and the Bishop's
fceretary , and ho wae well aware that some other provision
would bave to be made, it the Synod should resolve to carry
out this resolution It appeared to the committee that there
would bo other ways and means found for providing for
meso minga , ont that was a question he should be able te
moot at a later stage of the proceedings. He hardly ex-
pected that there would be much objection to the report, end
therefore ho did not like to occupy tho time of the committee
by dilating upon it any longer Whatever the decision of
tho question might be, he should receive it with good temper
and Christian feeling
The Rev Canon ALLWOOD seconded tho motion.
The Rev ALriiED STEI HEV, though entirely approving
of the abolition ti all marriage fees, felt it right to move an
amendment, which was, that ali the words after the word
' licence,"" m the second line, bo omitted, with a view of
inserting the following words, ""except a fee of ±1, be
abolished "" He believed that it would be inexpedient,
however desirable, to abolish the fees altogether. Tho
parish would be taxed to pay the salaries of the registrar
and tbo Bishop's secretary, and even at present there was
Eome trouble in gotting the Synod expenses The payment
of ¿1 es a marriage fee would not be felt aa irksome, while
it would provide the money requisito for the sálanos he
had mentioned
The ¡Rev R. W YOIAO seconded the amendment.
The Bev G N. WOOJJD objected that the abolition of
fees was contrary to the Kubnc, in which it waa laid down
that the bridegroom should present the "" accustomed duty
to tho priest and clerk ""
The Rev THOMAS SMITH objected altogelher to tho
proposition of the Rev Alfred Stepben Ho said that no
compulsory charge should bo exacted for the performance of
the marnago rite. He believed m popularising the Church,
but cot at the expense of principle, and he believed the
Church had been too long fettered by an obnoxious system
in connection with our marriage fees The best thing
waa to throw our doors aa wide open aa possible,
and let the people give what they considered to
be a proper and sufficient remuneration He believed
tbat a fee of £1 wouldlbe as distasteful aa a larger one, and
that tbo reduction would be of no use whatever. He hoped
I the Synod would come to the conclusion to take away every
particle of fees from the ritee of the Church. By meeina
of tbeae feea we now onlyllurncd people away from our doora
to get wbat thoy wanted at some of these matrimonial
huoketere' tahona. He supported the original motion.
Tbo Re-v Mr. BAKMLR roae to oppose the amendment
moved by the Rt-v Mr. btephon, desiring to sea the subject
moro fully and fairly discussed He foareá that the rotontion
cf the£l fee would tnvelvo all the difficulties which wore in-
cidental to the- present plan, and fail to effeot any impr v>
ment whatever, there wore, nevertheless, aa he thought,
many eases m which fees might yet bo left
jin) able to clergjmen who in tho interior bad
often to ride to a great distance to perfirm
the rito of mnrtiago It waa not so muob. a nutter
of money with them as it was a matter of sincero daiire
that they should not loso their people at a ontical and im-
putant penodof their Uves
The Rov. C F. GAIUSSEI had boen afraid that tho
Standing Committee were going *o say that no fee w ia to
be puid for the celebration of mamago because marnago
was a sacrament, but ho waa relieved to find that tho whole
matter was to be considered only OB a mattor of expediency
He did not think that the clergy of other religious bodies
did make a matnmonial.huckstenng shop of their ministerial
position ia tho celebration of the marriage rite He was tho
more anxious to have thus ui dcrstoud, as they were about,
it seemed, to ai-similato to their practice In p lint of fact
they were, it seemed, to be mado bogging friara rather than
butksterers, they were to a»k for nothing, but to take what
might bo given to thom Ho hoped that tho resolution
would be carried, but that no mputations would bo thrown
uj on tbo ministers of other denominations. They could
surely carry on their deliberations without resorting to any
such gratuitously oljectionablo romarks |
The Rev THOMAS SMITH said that ho must repeat and
insist upon what bo had said. He did think that thoro
were certain ministers who were not ashumod to make their
churches matrimonial h lekstor shops, as it wore, when thoy
public! ed in the newopapora tho rate of fees that thoy
charged for the solemnisation of marriage,
Mr JV'IL'ES hoped the fees would bo abolished, and
thought it certain that such a chuugo would be the means
of largely lncreacingthc number of the marriages celebrated
ni f he Church of England
IboRov P. W YOUNO had supportod the amendment, but
slill hoped that the time would come whon all feos would be
done away with, not onl) in respect of the solomnisntion of
matrimonj, but fees for the burial of tho dead and for the
churching of women.
'1 he Rev Mr I""o\. was stroigly in favour of the origi-
nal motion Ibu influenco that u clergyman exorcised in a
family, es a consequence of hi» having been the mmistor
who had married tho father and mother, was a very im
portant influence, which it wis most desirable to extend and
to maintain
Mr RICHARD JoivES strongly opposed the amondmoat
The Rev A H STEI HEN said that, as the feeling of the
comrmtteo appeared to be decidedly ogainBt thu amendment,
he uhould (b) leave) withdraw it.

Mr. OWEN was oppot-ed to tho resolution as being
in contravention of the constitutions of the Church of
Ln¿land
'the Eev. Mr MOTCETON thought that tho discussion wis
nrcdlcstly hampered by an unduo consideration of what
«OB called tho ""Parishes"" of tho Church m this colony
lhere was no euch thing horo as apaiishmtho English

ltatst that tbo pecple should bo married m this or that
church In removing tho marriage fee they had removed
ere obstacle, but they would not effectually attain thoir
nlject if they did not further amend the law in tho
manner proposed He ehould cordially support the resolu-
tion
The Rev, E M SALIN IFIIE Bhould oppose the résolu
tion, because it would, in his opinion, tend to subvert the
p> rocbial system. In his opinion, it was clearly within the
iflico of a Bishop to assigna territorial limit to a euro of
B( uln Ho was quite Euro that tho chango contemplated in
I Le feeB would be all that was required
T he Kev. THOMAS SMITH Baid that all tho clergymen
pttsent contributed to break these peculiar restrictions as to
pnritb (No) Well, certainly a great many did. Ho
the light that it was an evasion of the law for parties to ba
i ccemmodated wnh (croponry residence in a pariah for
ti vin days to qualify thom to evade the law. His own
pi rii-b, as it was called, was very îndtstmctly defined
It vi as preposterous to have to state that people might be
ni ov-ed still to come to a church situated as his was, for the
I em bt of tho sacraments and for public worship, and never
iheltEB to bo actually compelled to go to a great distance
to getmorned.
The Rev G. N. Woonrj objected to the resolution, as
Leirg opposed to tho 102nd Canon If the license that he
held in bia band bad any validity, he waa bound to respeot
thnt Canon, which waB most explicit on this point. He
hoped that in tbis and in every other proposed regulation
they would adhere to the wordB of the wise man-'. Stand
on tbo old paths, and medole not with them that are given
to orange .'
Mr, FoSTEit said that thoy had not in this colony any
such things as the "" Parish "" or ""Parish church,"" as they
ixisted in England. |
Mr. A, QortDON could not accedo to the résolution as it
now stood, because ho believed it to be directly opposed to
iho Canon. In regard to the ecclesiastical districts of this
colony, they were accepted by the clergymen of the dioceBo
who were licensed by the Bishop, and became to them what
the parishes at home were by the express terms of the law
of England. He thought the clergyman was bound
to carry out tho provisions of tho canon which
had been aptly quoted by his rev. friend Mr. G. N. Woodds.
The Canons of 1603 were as binding upon the clergy of this
colony, as a matter of contract, as thoy were upon the
e'ergy in England.
The Bev. A. H. STEPHEN suggested that the resolution
be so modified as to allow the marriage in the church where
ene of the parties proposed to be married resided.
Several Voices : "" That is what it is now.""
The Rev. Mr. STEPHEN pointed out that it was not quite
the some.
Mr. M, METCALFE suggested an adjournment of tho

On Wednesday afternoon last, a match, the Audit v.
the Treasury Departments was commenced, end concluded
yesterday in favour of tho former by 10 runa only. The
idea of commencing shorth» after 4 o'clock, which gives
over two hours play, for more reasons than one is an ex-
cellent one, and it is"" not at all improbable that other depart-
ments next season will follow the example. While it does
not nnctoach upon ofliuiiil time, there is une other advantage
about it that, plenty ot grounds are obtainable, tho time
selected being on off-days, when other clubs cannot use
them. It may be noted that the Audit had one man absent.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD.
Sir,-I respectfuly ask a few shoit lines of space to bring
under criticism tho vote of the House on the second reading
of the late Government's Land Bill That bill did not in any
way interfere with tho mam principle of tho bill of 1861,
it left that principle intact, and on this giound alone should
havo been read a second timo by a House piotessmg to be-
lieve m the land legislation ot 1SC1 Su John Robertson
tried to introduce a Land Bill at the beginning of the
session which he stated, embodied all the amendments
required, evory principle m vthich bill was in the bill of
tho late Government, which Su- John Robertson voted
against
The rejected Land Bill greatly favoured tho free
selector, adopting all the main principles put
forward by tho free selectors at their Confer-
ence , and yet strange to state, Mr B irbour, the
President of that Conlerencc, voted against it In the
rejected bill tho free selectors were favomed to a degree foi
beyond their wildest hopes or expectations, nnd yet dozens
of members who havo always pioiessed to be the free
selectors' fast and steady fnends voted against tho bill
If any one can pluck out the heart ot this mystery, 1 ask
him to do so, because to me it is in olublt Iho free
selectors will never again get a bill so f ivoumblo to Ihcir
interests, and this was confessed bv such wami friends of
the freo selector as Messrs Dav, M'Elhono, and Bennett
Tho principal objection to tho bill, as enunciated bv most
of tho speakers, was the very (,rav o niattei oi interest on
tho balances of futuio freo selectois Ot com se, there
were many other objections, but I submit not one ot a vital
character-that is, that could not havo been easily
amended m committee I do not know anv bill ihut
over carno before Faihament that was better entitled
to bo read a second time, alwa\s bearing m
mind that the wholo Paihamont favoined the principio
of tho 1861 legislation Tho House could have stiuek out
with ease eveiy bo-called defect that was riomtcd out during
the lengthy debate, and a bill could havo been passed in
harmony, at least, with tho opinions of honorable members
This was not done, for reasons that I do not attempt to
fathom, but it might have ha\o been done it men had
acted up to their opinions If any Land Bill is introduced
by tho present, or any future Government, I will ventaie
to make this small prophecy with legaid to it uinneh,
that it will contain every manciple of the late rejected bill
with the exception of the abolition of interest on the balances
of futuro free selectors, and one or two other matta s or no
great moment
lhe proposal to raise tho squatters' rent to the extent
of £400,000 a year secured, m my op mon, the -elec-
tion of the bill, but let any Government attempt to
introduce a Land Lill without this must ughteous pio
posal, and that Government wul meet with \erv sudden
death I am sorry the people h id not a chance of speaking
and acting ou this most important matter
I obseire the Albwy Mannt) stiongly condemns ""Mr
Barbour for voting against the second loading of the bill,
stating that it contained threc-fomths ot vhat the Tiee
Selectors' Conference put ioith.as their wants
There cannot bo a doubt of thi3 that the whole body of
free selectors would have voted for the bill to a man, as well
they might, for they will never got such another bill
If there is to be no attempt to separate the two great
interests, pastoral and agricultural, the people will not m a
hurry get so good a bill as that which has just been
rejected, which with a few easily made alterations would
have been in unison with the opinions of every member of
tho House From what has happened the free selectors will
have little difficulty m discovering who are their li lends,
and I believe the lesson will not bo thrown away upon
them __ I remain, yours, dLc,

Sir,-Just now'when so much'dependí upon bona fido
mining investment« it would bo well to examine tho recent
report of so prominent a company as the Peak Downs,which
has caused such a consternation in -tho minds of the invest-
ing public. After tho progress of the mino had culminated
in to splendid a success as that shown last half-year when
the whole of the nominal capital was returned, we had a
right to expect that the affairs of tho company were based
upon n really solid footing-a footing too «ure to bo upset
by the causes set forth in the last report. A comparison
between this and the previous report forces upon one the
conviction that neither the one nor the other represented tho
fair Btato of the company's position ; that if not both, cer-
tainly the last was written to havo tho effeet which it cer-
tainly had. There is no doubt about the effect of tho report
m July last, and I observe, in passing, that with this com-
pany the effect of the half-yearly report invariably pre-
cedes with singular accuracy its actuol issuo. The com-
pany's etock was raised to tho highest point it has yet
touched, while tho prcEcnt report tends to send it down to
o figure far below tho real value of tho shares. Every line,
evciy word tends to depreciate the company's position.
But let us take the points seriatim. ,
1. In July wo were told of the arrival of the
first shipment of Cornißh miners and of another
ihipnieut ""hourly expected,"" and that ""this acces-
sion of labour w ould allow tho mining operations to bo
pursued on a larger scale, the furnaces to bo constantly
supplied with n proper ossoitmcnt of oro, and the quantity
of me at grass to be much increased."" What has bocomo of
thiB other shipment ? Did the men over arrive, or did thoy
go to the bottom ? And if they arrived, how comes it that
the production of oro is Icsb than it was P How is it that
no mention of them is now made, but that wo aro only told
of a botch of miners to soil in Fobruary, and who cannot
poEsibly nrrivo in time to affect the production of the mino
during the now current six months t
2. Wo wero told last half-year what tho actual produc-
tion of the mino was, viz., 1449 tonB of refined copper.
Whereas now there is no information whatever vouchsafed
to ns, wo aro only told vaguely of thedecroosoof production
caused by a temporary want of fuel ; and wo know this,
that tliis ""decreased production,"" whatever it may hove
been, has cost £65,377, whilo lost half-year 1440 tons' of
refined copper cost only £60,671 ; that the smaller mun thus
expended gave a return at the rate of 200 per cent, per
annum, and the larger expenditure gives nil.
3. In July, when the object was to pay a big dividend,
every item which could swell tho company's profits was
set down. Storesand materials were valued; the stock at
the mino, the office furniture, and the petty cash found
their ploco in the balance sheet. Whero aro they
now ? They oro certainly not mentioned in tho bataneo
sheet presented to the shareholders.
4 In the last, as in all previous reports, tho balance
sheet has shown the actual balonco (Dr or Cr ) ot the
Bank of New South Wales Tor what reason, I should
liko to know, is this left out of tho present report? Ihero
must surely hnv e been n balance on ono side or tho other
6 In July, the directors were bo particular m estimating
the vnlno of oro nt grass that wo were told, even to an
eighth per cent, what it was worth,-viz , 164 per cent of
copper to tho ion of ore Every reasonable man would
suppose, with an exnet calculation like this, that such
extreme caro hod been taken that all possibility of mistake
was excluded, especially as m tho previous half-year the
oro was valued roundly at 20 per cent But it turns
out now that the valuation was nil wrong , and if the last
estimóte of 12J per cent bo correct (though there is doubt
cost upon this, for it does not tally with what the chairman
in his remarks gave os the average during the post six
months) it would almost seem from the successive grada-
tions that the intrinsic value of our ore has been sensibly
falling oft-first 20 per cent, then 16|, and now 12|
6 With the60 facts before the directors, and n diminished
value of copper m London, what justification hnd they for
paving on the 1st October tho final 5s of the July dividend
thereby absorbing £25 000 of tho company's funds, and
which ought to have been available for tho present half
year? lossy thot this only ""discounted the prospects of
the shnrcholdcrs "" is a mere gloss, and a very poor answer to
thoso who, like myself, bought upon tho strength of the
July report It was m fact misleading tho public os unmis
tokobly as it was possible to do, creating a fatal confidence
and giving the shares a fictitious valuo, and that by using
for the benefit of tho July shareholders, funds properly
belonging to the present shareholders

(From the Pioneer, May 4.)
THE following are the circumstances of the suttee case
which occurred in the Cuwnpore district : -
. On the 16th ultimo the brother of a woman named
MuBsumat Rahusia, living at a village six miles ironx
the police station of Sheolee in the Cawnpore district,
brought her tidings that her husband, a Brahman»
Omeid Tewarree, had lately died at Mhow. The
widow showed great emotion ; she broke the bangles
from her wrists, and shortly after began to crj|
"" Stitt Ham, Stitt Pam,"" repeatedly at short inter-
vals, announcing her intention to sacrifice herself.
The Pundit of the family advised the test to be
applied, vi-/.., that her hand should be placed over a
lighted lamp, to see if she could bear the pain. The
lamp was brought, the -widow herself placed lier handt
over the flame, and kept it there until it waa black»
ened and blistered, declaring that she felt no pain ;
Bhe was then declared worthy to perform the sacrifice.
A large number of the neighbours assembled, and
there appears to have been a good deal of apprehen
sion among them at this time as to the consequences
which would ensue if the suttee should toke place.
The members of the woman's family declared that
they would not allow it, as it was the "" Angrezi
amul,"" and the results might be serious to them.
The matter was left undecided that clay, though the
widow herself never seems to have faltered in her de«
termination. The next morning some of the family
started with the widow for Bithoor, for the purpose
of performing funeral rites for the deceased husband»
but the Pundit recalled them, Baying that the day wass
inauspicious. The widow continued throughout the
day to chaunt ""Stitt Pam, I will go and burn with
my husband."" Many people came to see her.
Towards evening she addressed some Thokoor zemin-
dars, and begged them to grant her the bson of a
piece of land for the sacrifice, At last one of the
Thakoors present appeared to be overcome by h I
solicitation, and said, "" Come, I'll give you a fisld,
be the consequences what they may,"" notwithstanding;
the protest of many present who prophesied the
danger of the proceedings. After this, however, less
opposition was offered, and large numbers of peop'e
come to make their obeisance to the holy woman. It
appears to have been understood this evening that the
suttee would take place. Early the next morning «
circumstance occurred showing the feeling of the
people. A man obtained admittance at down to the
house, and falling down before the womnn, addrcsserl
her, saying, "" Maharanee, I am moonblind, when,
shall I regain my sight ?"" evidently having faith in
the miraculous powers with which the intended sacri-
fice was supposed to endow the vie im. The woman,
however, who had eaten nothing for two days, and
drunk nothing but some Ganges water, appeared
much exhausted on this morning, and after begging
the people of the house to hurry on the preparations
lay down for some time gasping on her back. Hoc
friends thought she was dying and the Pundit ad-
vised a gnrment fangurkhee) of her husband's to be
given to her, saying that her soul was longing for her
husband, and perchance the Bight of his co.it would
revive her. The angurkhe» was brought by her son,
and it really seemed to pioduce the desired c-ilect, foe
clasping it to her breast she rose and called for the
musicians, and again addressed the zemindars presento
asking for a piece of ground for the performance oE
the suttee. The Pundit here improved the occasion to
address a sermon to his female parishioners :-"" Few
wives now-a-days,"" he said, "" love their husbands
lo well as this woman loves her huBband'saHjiirMfe."",
The Thakoor who had come forward the previous
evening again declared his readiness to give a field,
and hurried out to give orders for wood to be cut and
carried to the spot. Several men gave their assistance
in cutting and carrying wood, and as Boon as a pyre
was constructed, information was carried to the
widow, who, after putting on jewels and otherwise
preparing herself, lost no lime in proceeding at almost
a running pace to the field, followed by a procession
of some two or three hundred of the neighbouring
villagers-the males first, and the women in the rear,
succeeded by a band of village musicians pressed into
the service. On arriving at the field, the suttee, as
the woman is now called, mounted the pyre, on which
she set herself cross-legged, and gave instructions
that her son should set fire to it. This son, a youth of
about eighteen years of age, had brought a 'nundle of
grass with which to set light to the wood, and as soon,
as his mother was prepared he fired the gross. On
the flames rising the suttee half rose from her sitting
posture, on seeing which the spectatoas murmured in
dissatisfaction, but the woman immediately resumed
her seat, and signed with her hand that she had no
intention of evading the sacrifice. Shortly after some
of the bystanders threwTin more wood, the flames
rose and surrounded the victim, and the sacrifice waa
consummated. The spectators then brought flowers
and offerings of various kinds, threw them on the em-
bers, and dispersed.
Now it must be remembered that this suttee was
first agitated on the loth, and that it was not consum-
mated till the 17 th, and that during this time hun-
dreds of people were thinking and talking of little
else. Yet the police, it really appears, did not hear
of it until a chowkeeelar started from the guilty village
for the police station of Sheolee on the 17 th at anhouc
carefully calculated to make this information too
late. When the chief constable, Azeezoolah, reached
the scene of the tragedy about 1 o'clock, he found
nobody, and nothing but ashes. When he pushed
his inquiries, he was told that the woman had herself
collected wood and gruss without assistance, aid had
secretly, without accomplice, burnt herself to death.
The native police elicited no other information,
and they did < not communicate even this.
The District Superintendent, Mr. Goad, saw
this chief constable, Azeezoolah, on the fol-
lowing day, the 18th, and talked at length with
him regarding other offences in the district; but the
chief constable made no mention of the sulcce. It waa
not indeed until the 20th that the Azee/.ooloh sent
his diary, containing the false account which the vil-
lagers had in the first instance attempted to palm off
upon him, by post to his superiors. Mr. Goad at
once proceeded to the guilty village Where the vil-
lagers bolted their doors, and at first assumed almost
a menacing attitude. By great intelligence and firm
nfss, however, he ultimately succeeded not only in
obtoining|a full and true history of the caso, butin
arresting all the zemindars and others at a'l compro-
mised. The chief offmder, however, the widow's
son, Bohadoor, who had actually kindled the funeral
pilo on which she was consumed, has absconded, and
has, we believe, not jet bi en apprehended.

The quantity of ash is viry small, but thnt of sulphur

is a vory marked peculiarity of this coal, canudering
that it is remarkably freo from iron pyrttco, and tooday ni li-

The death of Mr. Maurice Nathan, of
this town, removes from our midst one of the
oldest merchant pioneers of the Coast.
Qeneralregrot was expressed on Thursday lint
when |it beaame known that he had suddenly
taken seri'iusly ill from some throat affec-
tion, but it caine as a, very painful surprise to
those who knew lum when told on Saturday
morning that on the previous «vening he had
passed to his last rest. Mr.Nathanfiist became
connected with the various interests of the J
North-West Coast close on 40 years ago,
wheo he established himself os a general
dealer at Fort Sorell before Latrobe had
become the business centre. He eventually
removed to Latrobe, commencing business
as a general storekeeper in premises adjoin- j
ing the old Commercial Bank, which he sold
subsequently to Messrs. E. ana W. L.
Bartlett.proceeding theucoto Launceitonaud
Melbourne, returuîug to Latrobe some
six or seven years ago, again setting up
business as wine and spirit und produce
merchant in premises built for his oivn use,
but which he retired from list year. He
was appointed a Justice of the Peace for
Latrobe during 1887, and was one of the
best attende» to the various duties such
appointment imposed upon him. The de-
ceased leaves no family, and was S3 years of
age at the time of his death, his widow being
a sister of the Messrs. Bartlett of this town.
During his long business career he bas
become known to pretty well all who reside
in the district, and general regret will be
expressed at the news of his demise.
The manager of the U.A A.A. is evidently
bent upon making the forthcoming exhibi-
tion u gigantic success. Ho lus just re-
ceived a letter from Nick Long, editor of tho
Olympian, California, with extracts from
I that and other papers, publiabin-* a chal-
lenge for £300 to the champion axe-
men of the United States und Canada,
and stating that the challenge had
been Bent to the various lumber
districts of Michigan, Wisconsin, Cali-
fornia and Canada, also stating tout an
effort was being made to secure the entry
of J. A Muiray, of Vancouver, the champion
axeman of Canada, for the forthcoming con-
tests, which take place in November.
lu all probability an entry will be received
for tho sawing contest from oue of the best

¡..m, - Having read from time to time
their reports as sent in to the Municipal
Council, and particularly tbe last one, I
caunot but express my thorough disapproval
of them. They have been, lo say the least
of it, thoroughly misleading,"" to use a very
mild expression. That they have done a lot
of mischief in this way by keeping any
number of visitors from 'coining to our
shores cannot be denied for* a moment.
Their reports were mainly supported by
hearsay information. I was very p'ojsed
thit they got from the Mayor, on their last
interview, such a dressing down. He showed
them that they spoke without book, and
virtually all tbeir complaints were moon
snlue. Thoy were completely (to uso a
familiar expression) knocked iuto a "" cocked
h-t.""
I should think a thorough collapse will
now follow ; and that tbo public will hear
no more of their sensational and misleading
reports. A consummation devoutly to be
wished. I think I could direot their ener-
gies into a n.ore useful and betittiog channel,
viz., to go and visit the poor of our city
(many of whom no doubt would be found
to be parishioners of St. David's), and ruined
by the collapse of the Van Diemen's Land
Bank. Find such out and give them suoh
relief us tbeir respective cases deserve, not
only from their own pockets but from con-
tributions they could obtaiu if properly set
about from the uhaiitably-disposed of our
city, many such I am fully convinced being
among us. Acting upon these principles
tbey would theu be really doing some good,
and for which they svottld deserve the praise
of every charitably disposed person in the
community. Hoping then that the above
coinmlttco will now Hi*baud and resolve
themselves into a philanthropic one upon
I the liucB herein indicated.

riders, all entries but two wero scratched. The contest,
therefore, becamo a match which was won easily by Mavis.
Hurdle Race.-Prinoo Alfred came in first, but, in
consequence of certain circumstances brought under the
notice of tho stewards, the race was declared no race.
Prince Alfred and his owner were disqualified for twelve
months. Mr. Williams, for scratching a horse after weigh-
ing out, was fined £25.
Ture Club Handicap. - Albyn 1, Robinhood 2.
Only three started, and Albyn won easily in 2 minutes 45
seconds. Tho owner of Robin Hood entered a protest on
the ground that Albyn did not carry the full penalty for the

, Mr. BUCHANAN asked the Colonial Socretary,
"" 1. Did the Coroner of Wagga Wagga write the Colonial
Secretary a letter in dofenco of his conduct in reference to
ihc inquest on the death of Mrs. Rush ? 2. In that letter,
<.r in any communication from the Coroner of Wagga
Wnggo, did ho state that the sistcrB and brother-in-law of
Rush informed him that Rush hnd been addicted to drink-
ing for mnny yenrs past up to the present time ? 3. Is tho
Colonial Secretary aware that the two sisters of Rush, also
his brother-in-law, havo made affidavits, which affidavits
have appeared in the public papers, to tho effect that thoy
never communicated to tho Coroner of Wagga Wagga any
such information OB the Coroner asserts they did, in his
letter to tho Colonial Secretary; and that thoy also,
in theeo affidavits, allege that Rush is now, nnd
nlvvnys han been, a temperate and sober man ? 4. Is tho
Colonial Secretary aware that Rush himself, aB well as
his sisters and brother-in-law, in tho affidavits referred to,
nllrge that, in consequence of tho cruelty and neglect of
duty on the part of the Coronor of Waorga Wagga, in oom
iptjKing Rush to bring the dead body of his wife a distance
of over thirty miles, BO that an inquest might be hold, in-
stead of himself going to whero tho woman died, and there
¡holding tho inquest, so pained and distressed Rush, tho

¡for nome timo in a state of temporary insanity ? fi. Has
'the Colonial Secretary removed the Coroner of Wagga
j Wogga from his position, or ia it his intention to do so,
¡without further delay Í ""
Mr. COWPER, in reply, stated that a lotter from tho
'Coioner nt Wagga Wagga had been recoived at his office,
and was rend by him to the Houso some time ago. He
, hardly thought it necessary to repeat the information whioh
, was eoniained in that letter. Yesterday certain affidavits
. wero received nt his office, but he had not yet had time to

Lauds,-""When will tho Government proclaim the road

frctn Taralga to Queanbeyan?""
Mr. COWPER enid tho road from Goulburn to Braid

Mr SUTHERLAND eaid the estimate Aad baon nub
muted in accordance with tho roport of the officers
Sir JAMES MARTIN enid ho could not imagino for a

evining tho Houso was not afiordod an opportunity of ex-
pressing its opinion on tho proposal originally submitted to
it, Tho roport of tho committeo waB brought up, and a
motion was made that tho recommendations contninod in
thnt rinorl Bhould bo ndopted. J ho Houso had not pro-
nounced its opinion on the matter. Ho gathered from
what wns taid in tho courso of tho dobato by mimbors of

inn resting and vnlunble chnrnetor Ho tboreforo
contended that befoio tho Government proccodod with

lead IIB to believe, tho country hadmado a miBtako in oon
s/ructing lines of railwaj» with n broud gaugo, with heavy
locomotives and trucks, when nil the ndvintigcs of railwvy
communication could bo secured bj narrow lines with light
echini B and other miling stock, it waa timo tho Government
paused lo deliberately consider tho question. Tho fact was
before them that tho Russiun Government somo joara ago
cunmcnccd a railway from TeBtiniog to Portmadoo, a
distanco of \¿\ miles, at a cost of something like £2000 por
mile This lino, ho obsorvod, had originally been com-
ún need at great cost, but upon the recoinmeudation of nn
English engineer-Mr. Fairlie-tho Russian Goiernment
stoiped the works morder to mnkcinquiries into tho ex-
penditure necessary for tho construction of nnrrow gaugo
railwnjB. Iho result was that the roBt of ihn line was not
onlv constructed with a nnrrow gnuge, but twolvo miles
which bad nlrondy been laid down wis taken up The
Russian Government also sent BODIO of its most ominent
engineers to inquire into tho matter, who j unod with
D nmiirk, Trance, Germany, and England in experiments
to test the value of the narrow guage sjstom If wo
could construct railways at a cost of £2000 per milo with
ly.Lt engines, carriages, and trucks, the country would bo
much moro inclined to sanotion nn expenditure to carry su""h
a svsttm into tho interior than to sanction a further expen-
diture of £10,000 or £15,000 per mile to go »n with the
prisent extensions If tho result of tho experiments which
had been rondo in Europo was before the Government
thi j would boin a much botter position to say what system
thej intended to ndopt, nnd thoj would bo acting wisely in
withdrawing the cstimnto until such information had
rinched them, He hoped, therefore, that tho Government
Honld net upon such advice, and not ask tho Houso to givo
a decision upon the voto, for ho did not wish tho Houeo to
tolo any step which would reflect upon their policy. Tho
lino of roilwny to whioh he hnd referred was 1 i', miles ia
length, nnd had been in operation for ooiuo years, and had
cost no moro than £5000 por milo including the oxpendi
turo on a tunnel which extended to n distance of 700
ynrdp, a work much moro cxponsivo than the tunnols on
the Bnthui st line
(An hon member "" What is tho state of labour in the
country r ')
Sir JAMES MARTIN said that labour was cheapor
than it wns here, but the cost of land made up for that,
whilo in the colony land WOB much cheaper It was proved
that the cost of tho wenr and tear of our linos aroso froa
tbo enormous weight of the rolling stock. Wo took an
ongino weighing 35 tonB with a vory heavy rolling stock,
while in eomo instances the trafilo was confined to a fow
flooring boards or a few louds of hay, amounting to one or
two tone Iho materials which wero convojed woro, thero
fore, out of all proportion to the truaks, and would not pay
the coat of working The light system of railway of which
be had been spenking would, however, only have n gua^o
of H feet, nnd in the casa of the Uno to which ho hid
particularly called attention, tho lino hud not
on)j been found to answer all requirements, but
hud paid dividends of 29J per cent The
gradients were also something remirkablo, nnd tho curveB
could be travelled over at tolerable speed, and with tho
greatest safety. There woro somo railways in England in
which the narrow gauges wero used, nnd tue same
system hnd been adopted m Trance and other parts of tho
world lhere could be no doubt that m Russia the
Government wero fully alive io tho importance of tho
question because of the groat extent of territory to be
cevered, and therefore tho inv ostigationa which had beon
mudo would bo of very great benefit Wo were now in a
position to take advantage of theBo great experiments, and
tbo Government ehou'd pause until the results wero boforo
them Ho submitted that the Govomment would do well
to hold back the Estimates for a few weeks, so that all tho
available information which could bo obtained was
received
Mr. COWPER admitted that there was a great deal of
truth in the remarks whioh hnd fallen from the hon
member, 1 ut tho proposition of the hon member carno rather
unexpectedly, and had taken the Government by surprise.
Ho was, therefore, not prepared atonce to state what courso
tho Government would pursue, although after a fow
minutes' conference they might amvo at a decision. Ho
would, however, point out that considerable difficulties
would ensue upon the withdrawal of tho estimate, seeing
that thero wero a largo number of workmen and contractors
on the lineB who would havo to be disbanded. Tho Go-
vernment ought to have a reasonable timo to conBidor the
proposition. At the present time his hon colleague, the
Colonial Treasurer, waa collecting soma information as to
tbo works now proceeding, to ascertain how far the worka
had progressed up to the present timo, but at tho present
moment he did not seo any difficulty m the Government
withdrawing tho item, unless bia hon colloAguo suggested
ftomo difficulty of a moro formidable ohnracter He thought
the Gov ernment had committed itsolf to works of a vory ex-
pensive character, which could have been constructed at
one-half tho cost, and tho information ho had gamed of
the working of tho Queensland and other linoB convinced
him of this fact, but he was not propared, without consi-
deration, to accept tho proposition of tho bon mombei for
EaBt Sydney
Mr. BUCHANAN said there wero other objections te
the estimate besides those advanced by the bon. and learned
member for East Sydney. He (Mr Buchanan) objected
to tho great expenditure proposed on the ground of its im-
policy, and he could seo nothing which vi ould prevent the
bankruptcy of the colony if tho présent expenditure of
mt ncv for tho construction of railways wero s inctioned
Ho tfiought, taking the population of Bathurstnnd Orange,
that thero would bo a ruinous Ins» on the outlay , and tho
same might bo said of other districta to whioh it
was proposed to give railwav extension. But ho
thought the objoct in view was tho concilia
tn n of the reprcBontntive8 of thoso districts.
We had also a proposition to construct a railway from
Goulburn to Yass, out of borrowed nionoy, which could
onlv havo the effect of gratifying the cupidity of different
Governments, and result in rum to the colony With tho
financée of the countrj vorging on bankruptcy, it was
monstrous to bring forward such propositions as this Lot
the Government introduco population into this wide
country to develop its expansive resouiccs, and then we
shtuld require railways and be able to pay for them
£241,000 for a railwaj from Bathurst to Orango would bo
nriecoof prepobterous folly, and if any private company
proposed it with their own resources tbey would bo pro«
iiounccd menee Tho receipts would be infinitesimal
Wo had nlrcndy constructed moro railways than the
country required, und having done that we might now
tit on the stool of repentance and look at our empty cir
ruiges running to absoluto seed. Ho would not be a party
to borrowing any moro money. We found tho Govern-
ment remitting taxation for purty purposes, constructing
railways for party purpose», and doing everything to pleaso
everybody and keep themselves m office, and it was high
timo to put a drag upon this sort of thing Our finances
wero in n hornblo state of confusicn, and if tno truth were
known, our expenditure was exceeding our income, and,
metí ad of imposing now taxation, wo woro adopting tho
Îrnctico of borrowing money for every conccivablo purposo.
f these p-oposnls to construct railways between placos
which had ne population wero known in England, they
would lauth the Government to seam, and look upon us as
a parcel of lunatics
bir JAMES MARTIN said, that if we had decided as to
the kind of railways wo should construct, Btill ho could not
givo his support to the construction of theso throe lines.
Ho still retained the opinion that tho propor course to con-
struct a railway m a national point of view was, to take it
to the south, and the Government of whioh ho waa a
member did proposo to take tho lino to Nnrandorn. Rail
w ays wero constructed m the United States, not onlv from
one inhabited place to another, but, in thousands of in-
stances, thoy had been taken to places where thero
was no population, nnd thej wero invariably found

men btr who urged that they should oarry tho line to the»

suppco that such a courso could secure the trade to Syd

Victorian line (hear, hoar) becauso by so doing thoy would
tako tho trado to Victoria If tho Viotonans had a
lino to tho froottor, and they took ono to some other point,
would that carry the whole of the trado of the colony t
They could no moro provent tho traffic boing divortedto
Victoria, if the Victorian terminus wore tho noarost point,
than they could stop a foaming torrent It was impossible.
They ought to connect the two lines (Hear, hear ) It
would bo desirable for many purposes-tor tho purposo of
union and federation, which bo believed would ultimately
como about. It would be statesmanlike policy to connect
tho two linos Produce would then como to the nearest
and bcBt market, whether that market wero Sydney
or Melbourno, and it waa a narrow policy
which said they should not connect them.
It was altogothor a narrow and unmistakable polioy to
imoç,iuo that the traffic could bo diverged from the boat
nunket Iho hon and learned member would tako tho
Uno to tho Southern territory becauso ho desired to settle
population m a countrj which could bo cultivated only by
irrigation Surely Bathurst and Orango presented greater
facilities, where there was plenty of rich land which coald
bo cultivated without irrigation In tho neighbourhood of
Orango whoat could be produced varying from twonty to
íorty bushels per aoro, ana thoro wero also rich coppor and
gold mines. Ho maintained that if the polioy wero
adopted of extending the line to tho south, they ought to
om and connect tho two capitals Whenevor thoy
did determine upon a vote for the extension
of railways, ho thought thoy ought to go to
Orango (Laughter and oheers ) But having epokon
to tho Engineer in-Chief in rogurd to tho matter ho did
not think that any grout injury could occruo if this esti-
mule were withdrawn for a timo (Cries of "" Oh, oh."")
If ho thought any injury would ncoruo irom such an
arrangement ho would bo no party to it, and ho would bo
no patty to an extension to tho south, unless thora was an
extension also to the west and to tho north [An hon.
me mber And the east Laughter ] If thero was likely
to bo uny evidence produced to show that sorviceablo linos
could be constructed at loes cost ho thought it would bo
weil to pause, but ho confessed that ho hud some misgiv-
ings in regard to tho courso ho was ab»ut to take This
was a favourable timo for raising monoy in the English
market, and ho would rather that the House gava the
Government tho money, and left it to thom to make all
neccBBary inquirios in regard to the railways to which
roferenco had been made, before making the expenditure.
It was only becauso he thought tho feeling of the House
wus in favour of gaining further inform ic_on that ho gava

Mr ONSLOW Baid ho agreed with tho hon and learned
member (Sir James Murtiu) that tho railway to the south
ehould bo extended, but ho was of opinion that it ought to
join tho Melbourno lino If Melbourno took away some e£
our trade we should get something from Viotocia Ha
could not help thinking that this question was nut con-
sidered on national grounds, and that there was a mean
feeling in connection with the matter. If it could be dono
ho ehould like very much to test the sense of the House tut
to what lmo ehould bo constructed first If he wore in
'order ho would like to movo that tho Southern lino bo ex-
tended to Wogga Wugga
Mr LACKEY said such a motton could not now be put
Mr ONSLOW said thero wero a good many members
who had got "" a bndgo agin Ihoir place "" and did not cara
about tho railway going any farther Ho did not think wo
wero rioh enough to oxtend tho thrco linos simultaneously,
but was convinced that if any railway would pay it would
bo the Southern when connected with Melbourne.
Mr WILSON said that a more extraordinary speeoh than
/ that of the Treasurer liBd never been dohvorod by any Min-
ster in that HOUBB. The bon. gentleman seemed to havo
forgotten the hifeh position ho held, and had allowed hu
feeling as member for Orango to overcome the higher duty
which dovolvod upon him of looking after the com-
mercial prosperity of tho colony He (Mr. Wilson) did not
soo why we ehould spend millions of money for the purposo
of benefiting Victoria Viotona made its railway towards
our colony for the purposo of taking away our traffic
Wo had twice the number of sheop thoy had in Victoria,
and jet Victoria exported twice the quantity of Wiol ox
ported fioni this colony He thought it was our duty ta
top the Murrumbidgco with tho view of restoring that
tnielo Tho fact of tho matter was thiB, tho pafls°ngor
traffic for manj years to como, witn our sparse population,
would not malo our roilwaja pay Wo muBtlook to tho
carnago of wool and other produce to make them pay.
Another argument usad by tho bon Treasurer waschet
the two cities of Melbourno and Sydnoy should bo umtoi
for the purposes of defence That was morely a fanciful
idea If any of tho largo Powers wera to land in this
colcnj, tho assistance which wo Bhould got frota
Melbourne would avail us very little indeod.
Ho waa nslonishod at tho mgumont used by tho
hen Treasurer with respect to tho ad valorem
duties The hon Treasurer stated that if wo earned a raü
wav to the Murrumbidgee, persons in that district would
overlook then own interests, and still continue to trado with
Melbourne Our ad valorem duties wero 6 per cont , tim
ad valorem duties of Victoria wore 10 per cent And wo
were told bj tho Ircasurcr that ho intended to tako off th»
ad valorem duties hero altogether Ho did not beliovo that
persons in the bouthcrn parts of tho colony would bo so
dead to their own interests IIB to continuo to trado with Mel-
bourno under such circumstancas Ho believed that if a
railway was constructed to tho Murrumbidgee the trado of
that district would bo entirely restored to Sydney There
was another point m favour of Sydney, and that was the
superior facilities Bflbrded in our harbour for shipping
ge ods to the facilities afforded at Melbourno The superior
fuulities that Sjdney possessed for shipping was, ho be-
lieved, equal to 100 or 150 miles of railway Ho know that
if a railway was to be constructed to the Murrumbidgee,
nany of tho Melbourno merchante would shift their
quaitcrs to Sydnoy, in order to take advantago of
tho facilities offered m this port for shipping

struction of the Southern line only, he believed that by

Oflico, remcmboiod a man named Gibb being chargeel on
that information before Mr R S Ross, J P , Miss Dick-
son was examined as a witness, I saw her sworn, and

Íiofcd In January, 1864, I saw Miss Dickson at Mait
iind, and lent hci some money , she had requested mo on
several occasions to advance her monoy on her horses, which
, she I lion had m Maitland, I think there worofivo, tho horses
1 paw were Zenobia, Kildare, lind Rockingham,, I did not
sec Stratford and Snrsfiold then , I refused sovonil times to
ndvauco monoy lo hoi, but having at lost consented 1
advanced her £230 in Mr Mullen's oflico thoro was pre-
viously drawn a bill of sale on the horsos , the document
pioduccd is that signed in my presence
By Mr Isaacs 1 ho names of tho horses had been filled
in when MIES Dickson signed the document, Mr Mullen,
MIKS Dickson, and my seit were present, Miss Dickson at
tho tuno said sho was in haste te got back to Sydnoy, and
we met bv appointment ut Mr Mullen's office, between 1
and 2 o clock of the day on which it was oxocutod
I had a portion of the monoy on mo and drew a chequo for
the balance , I w ent out of the oflico to tho bank boforo thobill
was executed, but it was not signed by Miss Dickson whilst
I was away at this timo I believed tho horses were at
Grancv s, Hunter R v cr Hotel, East Maitland , and I
believe she afterwards took them to Sydnoy, on tho third
psgo of the bill of salo thoro is a receipt, the signature to
thal and to tho bill wore signed at tho samo timo in tho pre-
sence of Mr Mullon and rnysolf, I boheve Mr Mullen
rend over tho document to Miss Dickson before sho signed
it
Bv Mr Bu 1er She mentioned fo mo the horsos , thoy
woio thoso then at Maitland , she luid the nnmeson a slip of
paper I know Rockingham, Zenobia, and Kildare, and
saw thrm at Maitland moro than once when negotiating
with her, sho was racing thom there, the money
was lepavablo m four months, when tho bill
of snlo fell due, she brought the (ho horses
to Maitland (Rookiugham, Zenobia, Kildare, Sara
field, and Stratford) to deliver over to me, she told mo
she was not ablo to meet tho bill of salo, and had brojght
the horses up to dohverover, and to roihse upon them,
how over, sho begged of mo not to sell them then, as races
wero coming off in Queensland, and if I would allow hw tj
take them there and make hor another adv ance, she thought
they would havoagood chance of winning, and probabh
put hci in a position to pay the amount of tho bill, I at
first refused, hut ovontnailj consented , tho further advtuico
made the sum up to £300, tho balanco wa3 £40 odd she
ÇTv c Mr Mullen and my solf a promissory note, dated ¿6th
Mm, ns an acknowledgment foi tho £300, the
promissorv noto producod is tho one she signed
it wns given as a collateral security to the bill
of salo, tlirco of tho horses were Rockingham,
Kildare, and Zenobia, that promissoi y no1 o has not been pud,
there was onlv one bill of sale between us thelettoi pro-
duced (nc'uug that tho dobt should remain a fow months
longei^-dated tho 9th May) is in Miss Dickson s hand
?writing and bears her signature
Bv his noNoit lhere was n promissoi) note given as i
mattet of accommodation botwecn Mr Mullen and unsolf
Bv Mi Bullei I received this letter before miking tho
further advance, and when she got tho advance she took the
hoifes to Queensland , I saw herat Maitland on hci retutti
fie ni Queensland, about the 19th or 20th Septembor, 1804 , sho
a ked mc if the horses wore brought up norn Sydney, and
?wlelbci 1 waa going to sell them, as I bad possession of
tht m it this timo, 1 got thom fruin \\ tUon, who brought
tin m from Queensland and they wero iu my rented stables
I E iu G lbb on t but occasion he and \\ fison handed ov cr the
lioisrstomc, thev wore tho three horses Kildare, Zenobia,
mid Ivockinglmni I told her 1 should »eil them next dav
nt noon unless sho lound the money to releiso them sho
siid she would endcov oui to get tho money by 10 o clock
next morning but failed and when the timo of salo c uno
sho askea me as a fin our lo put up tho horses in ono lol, as
if separated she would have no chanco of getting them ,
wlitn they weresoldthey woio bought in for me (through
Mi YVndo) at her request, she stutiug that sho would find
the money to pay for them in a week, they wero bought in
at £405, and nt this time there was due to mo nearly
£500, I believe sho soon,after went to Svdnoy, I
received two letters (produced) from Mess Dickson, and
?wrote an answer to the first, Ihiivo received no portion
of tho money up to tho present ümo, whon the bill
of salo wns drawn I askod her if tho horses wero her own
bona fide property , sho said "" Thoy are, Mr Y'oomans, so
help mo-"" , I asked her if any person hnd a prior claim,
lion, ormortgago over thom, and she said no, sho gavo
the samo answer to Mr Mullen , I saw a slip or memo
randuni with the names of the horses on it boforo the bill of
sale was oxecutcd, it was given to Mr Mullen for the
purpose of inserting tho names in tho hill of salo, I do not
know « hat becamo of it after Mr Mullon took it down
stairs to his clerk, it was m Miss Dickson's hnndwrttinjr,
and I believe sho gave it to Mr Mullen
By Mr Isaacs Mr Mullen said he had no (uno
to moko search for any prior hen upon tho horse»,
Miss Dickson being in a hurry to got to
Sydnov , it might havo been between 12 and
1, or 1 and 2 o clock, I cannot recollect exactly,
I bolievo the bill of sale was signed on tho 8th January , I
do not recollect Miss Dickson sa ing she was in a hurry to
catch tho steamer at Morpeth , I saw Mr Mullen put his
signature to tho hill of salo ns a witness , Miss Dickson did
not then, that I am aware, sign any other document thau
the bill of sale and receipt, tho note produced (dated 26th
October) is in reference to the accommodation given mo by
Mr Mullen, tho othcrnotonow produced (dated28th August)
is in my handwriting on the day tho bill of salo was
signed I saw Miss Jhckson at Granoy e, East Maitland ,
I had some con\els,ntion with Dr Dickson then, ho
thanked mo for lending the money to his dauehtei , ho had
previously said I could take security over his daughters
horses , ho did not paitieularly montion tho names of any
horses , the simo day, or tho day following tho
execution ol the bill if sole, I saw Zenoni i Rockingham,
and Kildare as thev w oro being taken to Morpeth, thev
?were at Graney s door, the first tm e I saw the horses was
at Maitland races, I think I saw the smill slip of papor
containing tho names of the horses before Miss Dickson
gave it to Mr Mullen I saw the horses at Randwick, but
never asked Miss Diekson to sell thom, I did not ni tho
saddling vnrd olfei £1000 for Zenobia and Kildare, she did
not on that ocuiMon tell me the horses wero not hera, Mrs
Dickson never churned tho horses until two or throe months
after they were put up to auction and tho first claim I
heard her make was sometime in November, sho did not to
mo claim them on tho night of the sale (Advertisement
handed to witness) Ihe horses were advortised to
be sold on the 22»d September, and this advertisement
might have appeared a day or two before, Mrs Dickson did
sot, the night boforo thoy w ero adv ertised for salo, chum
the horses as her own, the horses were bought in at the
solicitation of Miss Diekson, I havo sworn previously,
that ""tho horses woio bought in expressly foi Miss Dick
eon,"" and I gavo an explanation of that statement, in my
account I charged Miss Dickson a commission for the pur-
chase of the horses I considered I put thom up under tho
bill of sale, and that, therefore, I was entitled to a commis-
sion , I do not ehargo a commission to persons for whom I
do not buy , I did not nttempt to dony that I used thoso
words, 1 might have sworn at tho Insolvent Court that,
along with tho bill of sale, Miss Dickson gavo mo
a promissory note tor £243, which I discounted
at the bank, and which I had to take up,
Miss Dickson having failed to meet it, I did discount a bill
given mo by Mr. Mullen it was pay able at Maitland , I
do not think I ever discounted a bill given mo by Miss Dick-
son for £243 , I do not remember Miss Dickson giving mo

Mnrv Louisa Wentworth Dickson deposed, I am the wife
of Dr. Dickson of Rockbrook, Coogee, and mother of the
drfendont ; thero is a settlement by which I havo a separoto
«.lota ; I first know Zenobia in 1801 ; aho was choson'from
a lot ot horses at Mr. Myland'«, on the Clarence River ;
«ho was bought for mo, and, I believe, paid for hy Dr.
Dickson ; my daughter had nothing to do with that ; it
was on the 12lh Augu&t, 1801 ; I nover gava or sold tho
horse to my daughter between that time and May, 1861 ;
my daughter acted as trainer of the horse ; I receivod two
thirds or the winnings of the horso during that period, and
gave bcr one-tbird ; the document produced (doted 10th
September, 1803) was executed on the day of tho
date ! ty my daughter. [This was an acknowledgment
that j Zenobia then entered to rim in a race
was tbo properly of defendant's mothor; and
that 'défendant had no right, tille, or interest in the
horfcj or authority to make solo.] I novor heard from Mr.
Y'eon.nns that Zenobia was included in tho bill of salo
before September, 18(54; I had no knowledge of it from
any cuo up to that time; I purchased Kildare on the 2nd
Febtuaiy, 1863, from my daughter. (Documont produced
purporting to bo receipt for purchase money, £110.) I did
not know from any ono previous to 22nd, Suptcmbor, 18(31,
that Kildare wos included in tho bill of sale to Mr. Yeo-
man*; my daughter told nie in September that Mr.
Yeomans bad entered the horses in the bill of solo, but that
she had given him no directions to do so ; I purchased
Rockingham from my daughter. (Documont put in pur-
porting to bo receipt for tho purohosc monoy,
dated 9th December, 1801.) It ¡B attestod by Dr.
Dickson; the money was paid; between Deconlbor,
1861, and January, 1864, I did not dispose
of cither Kildare or Rockingham to anyone ; for the pur-
poses of training tho horsos wero in my daughter s manual
possession ; my daughter had farms near Liverpool, and
had a good many horses there ; I had nothing to do with
Sarsfield. Stratford, and Areola, or tho other horses oxcept
those I have mentioned; thoy wero my daughter's; in
September, 1864, I went to Maitland and saw Mr. Yeoman«
at Campbell'« Hill where I claimed tho horse» ; Mr.
Mullen must have heard me j ho was within hearing eba
attcndod at tho salo of the horses ; I went to Mr. Mullen's

to Mr. Mullen for £260 for the costs of an action by my
daughter against O'Mcaghor ; I signed a promissory noto
for that amount to Mr. Mullen, but not for costs of an
action which I never hoard of, and Mr. Mullen nover men-
tioned thom t» mo ; it was given in connection with tho
salo of the horses Sarsfield, Stratford, and othors ; Mr.
Mullen said ho would draw mo a bill of salo over tho horses
if I would fgivo a promissory noto for tho amount; the
horses were bought in for mo ; I did not got any of tho
horses, and tho noto was not paid ; Mr. Yeomans took mo
up from tho Courthouse to Campbell's Hill, tho boy Norton
being with us ; Mr. Mullen said ho was going to delivor tho
horses (Zonobia, Rockingham, and Kildare) ; on tho llth
Nov i ml or Mr. Yeomans said ho would drag us in tho miro,
that my daughter was a-villain, and that if I olaimed
tlio horses ho -would put a bullet through tho mare's hoad ;
about tho 30th, I remember that Zenobia, Rockingham, and
Kildare were taken to Queensland ; thoywero ontercd six
weeks before any raco ; I remember thom returning ; tlioy
were recoiled by ino. [Document tendered purporting to

By Mr. Butler ; One of these documents was signed by
Jumes Robinson (receipt for £100 on account of Miss
Dickson) ; ho was confidential servant to my daughter, and
was onco in my employment ; I saw him last about twelve
months ago in Sydney ; I bought Zonobia when a filly

bus gone to Braidwood ; I havo tried to got him as a wit-
ness ; ho was a servant of mine for a long timo and became
s jockey ; he was called na a witness at tho Polico Court
«hen 1 was prosecuting Gibb ; I havo only theso threo
raco htrses ; my daughter had Stratford, Sarsfield, and
ninny other horses; I should say about twenty ; I never
bought any but theso three, and nover raced any other
horses ; 1 raced theso threo horses through my daughter,
ns their trainer; they were raced in my daughter's namo ;
I think my daughter had a racchorso in 1860 ; 1 did not,
Lcforc that, enter a horse for a race, nor did I keep a racc
hoiso before tbnt ; I did not tnko putt in theso races at all ;
1 paid the expenses; my daughter como into my employ-
ment, as trainer, in 18G3; sho had read a groat doal on i
horses, and took to training them; I bought the horses
fiorn her, and then employed her totraiuthem; in 1863,
for tho first tinto in my life, T speculated with horsos on tbo
turf; I informed Mr. Billyard that the monoy ho was pay-
ing mo was tho price of a racchorso ; ho had nothing to do
but to hand over tho monoy to my daughter ; Mr. Billyord
wos my solicitor; I think that is tho only monoy he ever
paid on my account ; ho was holding manoy on my trust
estate, and I gave my daughter an order upon him ; in my
converfiilicns with Mr. Yeomans and Mr. Mullen
I never produced ono of tho documents referred
to, but I told them the horses were mine; tho
Mr. Terka who is montioned in one of the
documents, is a warehouseman in Sydney, and is my
trustee ; ho was not consulted about this documont ; ha
krew nothing about if,"" I informed him in November, 1861,
of the- agreement to purchase tho horso ; about tho timo, or
before 1 clnimcd tho horses ; I told him then, because I
wanted on assignment to bo made to sond up to Maitland ;
the horses wero brought back from Queensland in Soptoin
ler, and in that month my daughter told mo tho horsos had
been jmt into a bill of salo by Mr. Yeomans without her
consent; 1 heard that Mr. Gibb had tnkon them to Mait-
land ; 1 did not nrosccutc him thon because I wantod a
witness to prove that he took them ; Miss Dickson and Dr.
Dickson went up in the steamer with the horses ; 1 did not
>ce Mr. Gibb until I saw hin? at Newcastle; I saw tbo
horses on board, and saw AVilson and some of our servants in
elim gc of them ; I did not seo the horsos removed from tho
steamer, nor did I inquire what tho horses woro
coing to Maitland for ; no ono told mo that
Wilfcn was in charge of tho horses ; AVilson
did not tell me that Mr. Gibb was on board ;
our own two servants (Norton and Kerr) wero with tho
boites ; I did not see any person in charge ; the two boys
were with Hiern on deck ; I did not ask the boya where they
were taking them; I knew they wero on board before I
vi mt on boord ; that was the reason I went on board ; I
krew they were at Martyu's ; 1 v-.nt down to soo them on
:be Sunday ; when 1 got to Maitland I v. ;nt to Mr. Yeo
nirns to claim tho noises; I left thom on board the
-tramer ; not finding Mr. Yeomans at home I went to Mr.
Mullen's- 1 had heard they wero brought up to Eckford'«
Mollies ; I went to Maitland on tho 19th September, and on
ibu 20th or21sl went to Eckford'a Hotel and claimed tho
boires there ; I met Mr, Yeomnns on tho road nnd claimed
the horses from him ; I was up at Maitland attending a
nisi in which O'Mengher was concerned ; the document
(l reduced) is a promissory noto I gave to Mr.
Mullen to purchaso tho bill of enid for mo
In m 'Mr. YcomanR, and not to pay for costs ;
I pavo it after the bill of sale was purchased ; it was sold
ivn i he 22nd, and I gave that on the 23rd ; I think tho bill
»i tnlo-wns sold to fir. AVado ; tho horses wero knocked
down to him ; I understood from Mr. Mullen that he had
pi.i chased the bill sf solo forme, and that I would got the
hc/uos at 4 o'clock that day; on tho evening of the 21st
I íirked him to purchafo the bill of salo for mo, and to give
n.c up my horses ; I had then heard that the three horses
w err-included in the MU tf sale; I told bim thoywero
n ino that they were wronirly in the bill of solo, ond
icsiiuctcd him to purchaso them, and ho undertook to do
¡i : Dr. Dickson was present at this agreement with Mr.
Mullen ; I did not give tho promissory note to Mr.
O'Kcefu expressly on Ino score of costs; after I signod it
1 t'nvo it back to Mr. O'Keofo; Mr. O'Keefe saw mo
at (ho Court ; ho might havo told mo that Mr.
Mullen could not keep his appointment with me ;
Lut he did not say he was sent to get from mo
tho i romissory noto for costs ; I did not complain that tho
account of costs was too high, nor did ho explain to mo
be w they came to be so high ; I did not sign the promissory
note on account of costs, and had no interview with Mr.
Mullen about the costs ; I never gave instructions to draw
out the promissory noto for costs ; I did not ask that tho
buses should be bought in for my daughter, about the
<nmo,tiinc that I claimed them as my own; I asked for
thini to pay her own debt; I did not at Eckford'« on tho
n.nniing of tho sale ask Mr. Mullen to buy in tho horses for
mc, as I did not like my daughter to loso her horses, and
that I had mortgaged property in Victoria to pay for the
put (hace; lho evening before, I did ask him to buy in the
bil! rif sale for me, and ho said ho would ; he did not at
Frkford's refuse to buy Hiern for mo; I was present at an
intei view with Mr. Jenner and my daughter ; I askod him for
£-ICO, stating that I would put tho horses in his possession
until 1 iHtid him ; I asked him to lend mo the £400, to got
the hones from Mr. Yeomans, as I did not admire his con-
duct to her; I (old Mr. Jenner they were roy horses ; my
daughter nover said in my presence to Mr. Jenner that thby
i wcic her horses; nor did I say- to Mr. Jenner that thoy
i were my daughter's horses; I nover told Mr. Yeomans
I that t hey wero my daughter's horses, or write to him ask
[ ¡ngliini to postpone the salo; only one letter passed between
me nnd Mr. Yeomans, and in that I offered to pay my
dnucl.trr's debt to him on the horses ; I could not say that
in thal letter I said (ho horses belonged tome ; on tho samo
morning (hat that lotter was delivered, Mr. Chambers
claimed tbo horses as minc ; I do not recollect in that lotter
asking for a postponement of tho salo ; tho samo ovening;
I bad"" nn interviow with Mr. Yeomans, and he refused
to aectdo to what I proposed in the letter. (Tho
Iel ter dated 12th November was then read.)
Before that letter was dclivored I had actually
¡men Mr. Yeomans notico that tho horses wero mino; ho
i-nt'd he was about to sell tbo horses by privato sale; the Balo
bv auction was about the 22nd September ; on tho ovening
of the llth November I was sitting with Mr. and Mrs.
Eekfoid. when Mr. Yeomans said, "" Your daughter is a
gieat villain, I will drag her through tho mire, "" and used
other threatening languago ; Mr. Eckford said to mo
"" make an offer for the horses, and get Miss Dickson out of
Koilloi.d, for I am afraid she will bo murdered ; "" I thon
v\ioto that letter to Mr. Yeomans; the next evening Mr.
Yeomans commenced the samo abuse ; I told him the
limes wero mine, and that I would have them, and that I
l.rd paid Mr. Mullen £250 for tho bill of sale ; when tho
lirrfru were in Queensland I saw Mr. Solomons; I did not
tell him that my daughter and her horses were now out of
his power; instead ofthat I told him tho horses wero
minei I remember a conversation out at my place, when
Miss Dickson said, in Mrs. AVilson's presence, that sho had
reared up Zenobia on her farm.
By bia HONOR : The promissory noto was given on tho
23id September, and this letter was written somo timo after.

to get them out of John Solomons' way ; thoy woro to bo

B) Mr Isaacs I nov cr employed Mr Mullen m pro
fessional business, I had not rendered myself liable to Mr
Mullen for costs in the action by my daughter against

1 think in March, 186-1, ni) daughter entered the horaei
for races in Queensland, in September I had
several interviews with Mr Yeomans, m tho )nrdatthe
Police Office, in S) duo), Mr Yeomans asked me to swoar that
he bad got i ossession of the horses on tho day the bill of sala
was executed, or otherwise, Solomons would get possession
of them, I refused to do so, and did not givo evidence to
ti at effect, every effort to setllo the matter that I or ni,
wife could make, wo did mnke
B) (Mr Butler M) wifo is I behove on bail on a charge
of stealing theso horses, I did not seo the horses when thoy
were taken, I have seen them painted with oil, the family
is in mourning for my brother, who died the other da), I
do not remember that we were m mourning m 1863, after
Mr Yeomans lent ni) daughter the monc), he and I
were on intimate terms, ho asked mo in the Polico
vnrd to perjure mv self, I know Zenobia was entered for
the Queensland races-Zenobia, Kildare, Sarsfield Strit
fmd, and, I think, Rockingham, were up at those races
I renumber tho threo horses Zenobia, Kildare, and Hocking
ham going to Maitland in Ma) , Mr Solomons w«
n nkmg a claim here, and it was to get tho horses out of hu
wnv, nnd to save thom to complete (heir engagomonts in
Queensland, 1 was told that Mr Solomons w is on tho
v-baif to sei/o them , we actually passed tho horses close to
him, he was on the samo wharf where we shipped thorn
the) were brought back from Maitland to Sidney, and
shipjed ngnin for Queensland, I know tho object for which
the) wciosenttoMnitlnndwasnot to givo them into the
IosiCf-ion of Mr Yeomans, five went up to Miutlanl
seme of which were to be given up under tho bill
of sale, two of theso were Stratford and Sarsfield, these
three were not taken up to give to Mr Yeomans, 1 think
Mr Solomons sent a warrant up to Queensland, ia June I
thirk I first heard of the bill of sale, but I cannot tell pre
tiselv , I know Mr Solomons was claiming tho three horses
Zenobia, Kildare, and Rockingham, I behove ho claimed
ti cm en (he 24th of Ma) , I was not moro careful in taking
I hem awi), because I knew he had no just claim upon
Ibcin, 1 bchevo his was a most fraudulent transaction 1
will swear that two other horses wero removed at the time,
ro) daughter told mo tho names of these tbreo
horses were fraudulcntiv put into his bill of silo
b) Mr Solomons, I wrote to Mr Yeonmns, pro
posing that there should bo an assignment
of the bill of Bale to trustees for my wifo and daughter, i
did not write for an assignment lo mv daughter, it is
probable I did for my wife, I said I wrote to Mr Mull«
for such on assignment [document produced purporting »
be the letter proposing such assignment], that is ni) nime,
I wrote the letter, tho assignment was to bo to mv wife,
Mr Mullen agreed on the receipt of tho promissory note ti
purchise the bill of salo, ho said about £300 waa duo I
disputed tho amount, and said there could bo nothing of tue
kind, I knew £2J0 was all she got from bim, I never knew
that £S0O was duo until September, at tho timo Ino pro
missorv note was excculed, Mr O Keefo said there »as
moro clue, but that would do now .
ByhlsHoNOit The £250 was to getpo^ei-sionoftue
horses , , ...
Bv Mr Butlci Tor the £2j0 m) wife was to t«»
possession of the horses, I did not before that heir troni
mv daughter that she owed that amount I did not umu
September, hear that ni) daughter had giv on a pronu-sory
note for £300, I heard that she gave a promissory now
when the bill of salo was executed, it is probable that in
August I wrote to Mr Mullen a letter about this promu
sory note, I boliov o I received from a bank a letter in
August saying that ni) promissory noto was duo to soma
one in Maitland on behnlT, I believe, of Mr Mullen and
Mr Yeomans, I was completely token aback on receiving
it, and wrotoavory cautious reply, I remember wniing i
about n promissory note of my daughter , IW<1S,0T,7'
tho letter I received that the promissory noto auiountea »
£300, 1 beard of this promissory noto in August ana m
September, Mr Mullen agreed to buy tho horses for ra;
wife for £250 , I think the lottor as much surprised mv w>
as mo when I showed her tho letter, I did not m ny

pton lsod that, if no ono brought this matter forward, thoy
would tuko action in it themselves and m fulfilling that
promise he had mado himself moro prominent than he
should otherwise have been in this matter Looking upon
tho Bulject as ono of great importance to this community
ho certainly had taken a good deal of troublo with it It
was a matter of greater interest than appeared upon the
fuco of it, and a little explanation would show that such
was tho ease I ho resolution ho had to movo was -"" That

circular from the general manager of tho Millwall Docks,
and ho (Mr Mort) would read it -
' Believing that tho wool brokors ona importera for
somo timo past havo entertained a dobire to concontrato tho
slorngo of wool, and so avoid the mconvenienco and losa of
time caupcd by tho warehouses being spread over so many
parts of tho city, I venturo to direct your attention to thoso
docks as affording n Bite peculiarly suitable for tho purpoao
[Tho Millwall Dooks Company were, no doubt, iutorestod,
as (hey would get the ships into their dooks, but it
mattered little what their object was so long as it suited
ours ]
"" 1 hcao docks adjoin tho West India Docks and aro now
within twenty seven minutos of the Tenchurch stieot
.Station, wheoco trains start overy quarter of an hour A
ehort branch lino from tho Blackwall Railway is now boing
constructed, which will place tho docks in communication
with tlie North WcBtern, Midland, Great Northern, and
Great Eastern railways
"" Tho amount of warehousing charges paid list yoar by
tho wool trado nmounted to very niarlj £200 000 Of
this turn about forty per cent was onsumod in working
ehnrges, tho balance, upwards of £100,000, boing for
interest on money expended in providing warehouses, and
for pre fit
""Owing to the greater part of tho warehouses boing in-
land, iho working expenses oro increased largely by tho
items of cartage and lighterago With the Btores at tho
waterside, and adjacent to the ships, tho outlay under these
heads would bo avoided, and a corresponding reduction
effected in tho working charges
""With lhe railway facilit es tho buvers also would bo
benefited Carting to tho stations would be prevented, as
tho wool conld bo transferred direct to the railway trucks
from tho warehouses ~ ~~r~^
"" 1 his company has nearly a hundred acres of land with

London on n long leaso, and wita covenants as to the
water and railwaj accommodation The docks aro capable
of taking vessels of tho largest Bizo, and havo a dopth of

profit on the whole trade would bo sufficient to próvido
warelioiiBi'S and all the needful appliances : or tho trado, if
it preferred euch n course, could reduce existing charges
une-half, and yet secure a eatisfactory return on its outlay.
fHow much did they think one-half would bo ? To thoso
colonies it would bo £80,000 or £100,000 per yoar-au item
very considerable to his (Mr. Mort's) mind.]
i "" The land availablo being ample, the show warehouses
<ould adjoin ong another, and bo on one floor only.
Abundanco of light would thus bo gained and the fatigue
uf ascending a numbor of stops avoidod,
"" Adjacent to the warehouses could bo erected brokers'

niences,
"" 1 sholl bo very happy lo wait upnn you at any timo to

This circular was signod by Mr. G. R. Birt, the general
manager of tho Millwall Dock Company. Now though ho
(Mr. Mort) granted that this carno from an interested
hourre, trom a dock, company anxious to get vessels into
their docks, and so secure the chargea upon thoso vessels, it
waa not the less pertinent as regarded our interests. ""Wo did
not care BO long as we got tío charges upon our wool
reduced. A gentleman, largely connected with the wool
trade in this colony, had handed him a statement of the
consolidated charges upon wool at tho warehouses. The
rent for threo months upon an ordinary bale was 5s., and
the prices increased as tho weight inoreased up to 8s. per
bale. Then thero were extra charges for damages, and' so
forth, but this was about the average thing. At the prices
quoted hero ho was satisfied that not only were we at a dis-
advantage in tho exhibition of our wools, which was an im-
portant point, for the distances at whioh tho ware-
houses were, and the woy in which tho wool was
i-rammed into inconveniont places, injured our sales,
but we paid through tho nose most enormously. If we
i-ould only adopt a system whereby these colonies could
become their own warehouso-koepors, wo should save our
pocket 8 very largely indeed. He moved with somo little
hesitation in a measure with which ho was not acquainted
. by personal observation, but he might state that the dif-
ferent parlies with whom he had conversed, and who had
teen theto things, had given him positive assurances that
nothing could be worse than the syetom now adopted. He
had enid when ho started that tho object of this mooting was
lather one of inquiry than declaration. Ho did not state
positiv: ely that these evils existed ; but he said that matters
.bould bo inquired into, that tho time had, arrived when
these colonies should BOO whother they would not
lo benefited by having their own separate warehouses.
There was another point of view from which this mattor
was to bo considered. Our wool was coming into contact
witti nil other descriptions of wool. Ho was under tho im-
pression that if you wont into bad company you wore sus-
pected of hi ing bad yourself ; and if our wool wore placed
with Cupe and other low-priced wools, thoir inferiority was
reflected upon our own wool, and tondod to lower its price.
He -WOB quite satisfied a sufiiciout caso was made out if not
for declaration, at least for inquiry. Ho know thero were
gentlemen in England, and in tho colonies too, who dis-
couraged this movement ; that there woro gontlemen hore
who would endeavour to shew that it waa not dosirablo to
liisturb this system, but that tho question should be re-
ferred te the existing committeo in London who regulated
these Eales. Ho did not wish to say a word
ngaihfvt these gentlemen. Ho had no doubt thoy
did the'r duty conscientioUBly ; but we wanted to get
people who wero themselves largely interested in wool-
ton ing, und not merely in wool selling. Ho was largely
interested in woolgrovving himself, and ho thought the
I lai get t possible advontago would result from this meeting,
if it were unanimous in sending homo an expression of ita
withes. Tho resolutions were modoBtly worded, woro not
' offensive in any senso or form, and would elicit an auswor
to the effect either that things should remain as they wore,
or that it was time to look out and make other arrange-
ments. At present thero was a general feeling of discon-
tent among the wholo community, and it was desirablo to
set that feeling at rest, inj'ustico both to the community
of England and ourselves. The resolution did not
attack the present system of sales, although it was
found that the brokers charged muoh. too high.
They wcro said to charge both the huyors and sellers, and
certainly their charge of half per cent, did look very bad
indeed. It was just possiblo that we might be, to uso a
colonial phrase, ""barking-up the wrong troo"" now, but
whatever came of this meeting could ouly bo for good if
they wei e unanimous in their resolutions. If theso charges
vveio right no alteration would be sought for; ifthi'y wero
wrong wo should have theui altered at once. Ho was
strongly of opinion that our interests ought to ba entrusted
lo the class of persons who hud to pay the piper, and ho
hoped tliis point would be boroo in mind whoa tho raao
lutious were put to tho meoting. Ho was largely interested
in steck in Ibis colony ho WBB corry to Buy, and ho was
1'ioking aft« his interest by attending this meeting; and
he t-liould i n happy if the'little trouble ho had taken in
this matta- should lead to n good result. Ho bogged to
move tho resolution.
Mr. A. Ki-MMEiiER was happy to second (ho resolution,
and could only tay that lost 5 ear wo paid about tenpenco
per bale more thnn wo did before, nlthough the prico of
wool had depredated. Tho fall in the prico of wool
mado this pudden increase in the charges como very
hea\y. Some of tho warehouses wei¿ convenient. The
London Docks were vi ry good, but others wero isolated
iu.d M) constructed that the wool could not bo boon
proptrlj.
Mr. lil ED paid that persons who referred to their
delivery weights would find Hiern very different to tho
lending vesghtft-There vc us f rrqm n'ly a discrcpincy of
[ riven or ton pounds per bale. The woolgr<jweis lost thi*,
mid what taranto of it ?
l Mr. T. S. MOUT suid this was délicat"" ground to tread
[ upt-n. It wai. broadly tu-sertcd that a bulo of wool wiu
not now allowed to iucrcuBo. in tho Loudon, warehouses,
In forn cr times thero was always a large incroaso upon
the colom ii neights, and now thero was nose
Iho resolution was then put and passed, without
dissent.
Mr J B WATT proposed tho serón1! roBolution, which
he paid, did not f,o quito so far as many gontlomcn wished,
but eimplv confined us to making inquines upon this
sulject The wool sales wero managed by a comimtteo of
{.eiithmin interested in the wool trado and ibero wis no
article of produce that received such great ciro as this
wool Thcso gentlemen would, ho was sure, adopt any
good bill {.estions put beforo them, and it was only right
that wo should put them in motion, so that thov might
do something to save money. Thoy had boon
in motion already An agitation took plao
some timo ago, and lotters which hod appeared
m tho newspapers had attracted thoso gentlemen's attention
It was said that the wool Bales should be moro frequent
that tbcro should, in fact, bedaily salos Ihobrokera woro
indifferent m tho matter But it was stated that if the salos
w ro held daily tho foreign manufacturers would not como
to them , that only thoir agentB would bo thore Tho wool
staplers wished to have tho daily sales, as thoy would turn
over their money moro readily and keep moro of tho trado
in their hands Would wo boboneflted by throwing tho trado
into tho banda of tho staplers p Ho brought that forward as
a matter for consideration At present, under the system
adopted in Ltndon, nnyono might Boll wool from day to
day Ile had dono it privately, but ho seldom found that tho
private eales wero any advantago Tho buyers wero m°rely
persons who anticipated an advance at the quartorly sales
ADy one could sell pnvilely at any time iho resolution
to which tho gentlemen forming tho committeo had arrived,
WHS to have fivo or six eales in tho year instead of four,
lut thoy decided against a s}stem of daily sales Ho
begpod to move tho second resolution which was as follows,
- ' That n feeling pervades the wool growers and others
interested in wool that their mtoroste would bo furthered
I y more frequent sales in London , and this mooting ia of
opinu n that tho matter should bo inquired into, and, if

mattor should bo inquirod into, as thoro mast bo a foaling
of doubt as to whether it would 1 o to our advantage to have
daily, fortnightly, or monthly salos, or whothor the colony
would gain anything by altering tho present system of

in Belgium and France Iho wool so shippod was sold at
a lower price than tho wool which was sent direct to
London and Bold at thu quarterly sales Tho deprecia-
tion in the prico arose from thero being infinitely
leas competition than at the London sales
Tho buj ore congregated at the London wool sales from all
parts of tho Continent, but they would not think it worth
their whilo to attend particular Bales at which onlj small
lots of wool would bo oflbred This led him to behove that
it would bo moro to tho ndvantago of the colony if tho
wool were sold in largo parcels, though ho was not pre-
pared to Bay whether it was an advantage to havo it sold
in such largo parcels as wero put up now Ho had no
hesitation m seconding tho resolution, which was to tho
effect that tho matter should bo inquired into
Mr BINNIE drew attention to the injury which the
woolgrowcrs suffered from their wool having to remain so
long in London wi'hout boing sold If a cargo of wool
arrived tho day after the sales had commenced, it had to
rernnm in the warehouses for threo months before it could
bo told That w as a grievance He did not know whether
the sjstem was right or wrong, but it seoined to him
injurious
Mr S D GORDON suggested that the resolution ought
to go a littlo further than it did It waa all very well to
inquire, but wo ought to take stops to romedy the evils wo
all complained of Ho thought there was no grower of wool
who had not great reason to complain of the way in whioh
bia interests w ero dealt with in London Wo should state
exactly what we desired to be done Instead of having
quarterly sales as wo had now, and tho wool being kept
over from ono quarterly sale to the next, entailing loss of
interest, and other expenses, wre should hin e sales monthly,
nnd wo should not allew ourselves to bo placed so coin
1 letelj ra the hands of the brokers as we now wore He
w as not aware of tho modo in which the sales wero con-
ducted in London until ho went there, and saw the opera-
tion going on It astonished him to seo that the interests
of persons in tho colonies woro altogether disregarded The
wool waa put up, and if there was no bid the auction""»*
named a price, and reduced it littlo by littlo to u price at
which Bomo ono took it Thoro was no pauae The
moment a bidder said ho would take tho wool, it was
knocked down to him Tf thu wool was put into tho hands
of the broke»«-, tho owner had no control over it at all
could not buy it in or prevent its being knocked
down He lind seen it knocked down at a consideiablo loss
These were things that the shippers of wool should con-
sider, and not put themselves ra the hands of men who
vi ero making immense fortunes out of the woolgrowcrs of
this colony Ho should, pc-hsps, La out ""* o-dor in. re-
ferring to the resolution which had already boen passed,
but it had Btruck him 'h-1 -i.- MJ'°"">!1 Dock Company,
having this large area of land, might build stores thereon,
und rent them to the gentlemen who it was intended should
manage tho wool sales in London. If the company would
build the stores and rent them it would bo a greater ad-
vantage to tho parties concerned than if we were to build
warehouses of onr own in London Ho thought wo should
express our opinions clearly as to what wo wanted dono. If
wo left the matter to be dealt with by parties in Len
don w o should not get any advantago from our meoting ,
1 ut if w o stated clearly and distinctly what wo wanted dono,
( ur statements would no doubt have a go d effect at homo
Ibis resolution would net go for ho was afraid towards the
objict they had in view
Mr MOLLNEALN. suggested that to havo an opon marko
for the calo of wool would bo better than to havo periodical
tales
Mr A CAMI HELL said there was a good deal of force in
what Mr Gordon had said, and considered that by allow-
ing the resolution to go forth in its present shape we should
bo stultifying ourselves If tho meoting was of opinion
there should be monthly sales, why not say so ? If it>>raa
not of tha* opinion, why say anything at all about tho
matter r There were four wool sales in the j ear now, and
ho did not think that having five sales ra tho year would
mend the matter He believed commeice in wool was
regulated by tho some laws as rogul ited other commerce
What would bo the state of the market here supposing that
ne sales of tea wero held until all the ships that were ad
v ísed had arrived ? A friend of his had said the foreign
buj era would not come to London every month, but ho
believed the foreifcn buvers woro practically in tho market
from the beginning of May to the end of September. Tho
wool sales were almost always going on. One commenced
as soon as the other ended
Mr MONTEI-IOUE Thero ia a six weeks' interval
always a fix weeks' interval
Mr A CAMI HELL That was a greater interval than
ho thought, font had appeared to mm ono sale was scarcely
over beforo another commenced There would be ne fear
of foreign buyers attending if they wanted our wool, and
he did not think thero would be any difficulty in getting
them to tho monthlv sales By having thoso monthly
tales wo should guard against tho accumulation of stooks,
which was important Buyers might well bo frightened
whenthiyhad to faco such largo quantities when the
demand waa not very great The resolution should bo
mado moro explicit If we wanted monthly sales we
should fay so, and if not, wo should not mention tho
matter at all
Mr II AL STIN said this question was sottlod by tho
buj era rather than the sellers Thore oxiated in England
an association of buvers who settled as to how tho sales
i-hould be regulated If tho bujcis did not chooso to fall
îuwith our prcject wo should simply make ourselves a
luughini, stock Whatevei resolution wo paused tho buj era
in Lntlund were tho persons with whom tho nutter would
have to be settled
Mr. JOHN HAT did not seo that tho agreement of tho
bu} i rs should bo enti rtuined at all, and it was not for this
meeting tobe influcnci-d by any reflection as to whether the
bujerb would laugh ut UB or not. Was it intended in theso
resolutions to express any opinion nt all ? If those gentlo
men who had the centrol of these matters were to piyno
attention to ut, what was the use of sending homo any re-
solutions al all. Wo might as well go homo without put-
ting anything on record becauso we were told that nothing
could I e done. Let us at nil events express our opinions,
and thoy would bo taken for what thoy v. oro worth; but
if ivu Ecpaiate without expressing any opinion, then wo
could only expect to be laughed at. It might bo that tho
majority were not pieparod to express any decided opinion
un this matter, but in'that case ho thought it was high time
to consider what our interests were, for they wero really
exceedingly important, Ho could not help considering tho
resolution as not being of grpat value, because it did not
say that we inclined to anything. From the observations
which fell from tho proposer and seconder of the re-
solution, it would appear that th'cy were opposed
to moro frequent sales. [Mr. MONTEFIORE : Not at all.]
He thought they gave some reasons why thero should [not
bo frequent nales. [Mr. MONTEFIORE : I gave reasons
both wayf.J He thought it would bo best if at first we
api uii.tcd ¿orno committee to inquire into this mattor, and
bring up a îcport, to show reasons for acquiescing iu tho
prei-inl state ot things, or to show reasons for not doing so,
We> WUP as }et osly prepared for inquiry, not for expres-
sion of opinion on the subjtct. The resolution as it stood
was not liki ly to huvo much weight if it were sent homo at
the piefciit time. It should express Borne opinion. If we
could satiefy oui selves that a certain view was right, and
intimated that view strongly to tho genlleuion in England,
some gced wenild bo done. Hi« could not see why wool
should bo treated differently to every olher article of com
iiiiu-f. Ho was not nware that thero was any other com
niodi y of thfi EalLe valuo disposed of iu the samo way in
Ergli.nd. Ho believed that monthly sales would bo of
gn at advantage.
Mr. T. S. MORT said if Mr. Hay had followed tho third
lOFulutiun, he would have found that the end ho sought
was utan d nt.
Mr. HAY said it was upen comparing tho I'ÄO rcsolulinns

Mr HIHST said that it appeared to him that the amend-
ment which had been made on the second resolution had
destroyed the sequence which before existed betwoen it and
tho resolution jUBt submitted The second resolution
Bimply amounted to this, that pendrag inquiry, the matter
remained in abeyance, and how, therefore, could wo
npporat a number of gentlemen in England to confer with
us upon a question on which we had as yet no decided
opinion ?

Mr T S MORT did not want to utter ono word ra dis

Mr S SMITH said that it appeared to him that we
should be overlooking a wiso action if we refrained from
appointing a local committee It was his opinion that the
Chonibera of Commerce in each of the colonies might bo
verv wnll oe-cupied in dealing with a question of this kind,
nnd that in them we might havo Eccured a body that
v ould have mado all tho local inquiries, and bo enabled to
inform the London committee as to tho exact services wo

organisation would bo most permet if wo had, in the first
instance, n local committee to draw up a statement con-
taining the points which we deaired the London committee
to look into The local committeo might ask the London
ccmmitteo to place themselves in frequent communication

IB medical science keeping pace with the times, or has
it become a science of fee» and protected privileges *
With the exception of a few discoveries by master
uund<!, one or two of -which have appeared in isolated
generations, is anything more known to the followers
of the mctliLal oit or medical science than was prat-
tled by the profession hundreds of years ago > If
these ciuesttoiiB arc fairly weighed, the conclusion
nust be arrived at, that the medical profession is
lamentably remote from that perfection to which it
ought long »go tn have attained The fact is, that
the diKiples of yLsculapiua arc pitchforked into the
profesnon through maternal or paternal influence,
quite ns muth OB are the ministers of religion. There
IB no neccsBity in either COMO that the mental qualifi-
cations of tile youth, his tastes or predilections, i
shou'd bt consulted, lhc notion is entertained that
the inspiration of schools and culleges will make a
bright genius out of the most commonplace materials
Hence it is that both professions-yes, and many other
profitions besides-are erowded with shams , the
medical, with those who know nothing except how to
blistir, administer a bolus, and charge a fee , and the
ecclesiastical, with those whose only mission u to
afflict and punish their hearers
Following the example of Stemc-who founl his
sympathy to be bifit called forth by taking one unfor-
tunate victim under consideration at a time-the
truth of the foregoing remarkB will be moBt fully illus-
trated by a reference to one solitary disease which
hue affected childhood from the days of the ancient
Greeks to the present time. The ancient Greeks
called hooping-cough the ""wild or untamable
cough,"" a name which, for anything medical science
hoB done, may be given to it at the prisent hour. It
would be ns vam to ask the profession what hooping
cough ii, as to inquire philosophically "" What l8
heat ?"" Tho duty of the medical profession ia to euro
the patient, but not to prevent disease arising , hence
it need not be expected that any but a few minds will
ever bo directed to search and find out tho cause of
dicebse, what particular diBenses re illy are, and how
they might be prevented
As a non-profesMontl, I have been led to make
these remai ks from obberung closely some cases
of the above-mentioned disease which have come
under my notice. I shall give the whole particulars,
in the hope that other non-professionals will observe
for themstlveB whatever diseases may happen to come
within their notice. During avery wet day two boys
were returning from school, one at them put on three
pairs of trousers, and the other put on a thinner pair
than usual-each in this acting nccording to hia own
judgment Before reaching a railway station both
got wet, and had to Bit in their wet clothes till nearlv
home. The boy of the three pairs of trousers showed
symptoms of a bad but ordinary cold next day , the
other was none the worse for his ducking. Tho hrst
boy had a hatsh cough for about a week, during
which time mustard applications to the chest wore
used ; his feet were bathed in hot water and mustard
every night prior to his going to bed ; ipecacuanha
and other expectorants were admimstere I The
cough continued, nnd increased in violence On the
bLventh or eighth day the other boy begun to cough,
and another and younger boy-all of them slept in
the tame room-began ubont the same time. On
the eleventh or twelfth day, a child six months'
old, m the same family, began to cough. It was
therefore evidently a contagious disease, lhis was
more clearly proved by adult persons in the sime
family becoming slightly affected in the throat and
chest. It was from sixteen to eighteen days after the
iiist attack before any decided hoop w AS observed, or
about the time when expectoration set in.
Here, then, is a disease which appears to bo con-
tagious, bul not in the first stage. How is it com-
municated ? What is it5 lias it spores, like certttu
vegetable fungi, floating m an extreme state of sub-
division in the atmosphere of a room where a p-iticnt
is ? 1B it a disease which can be prevrnted ' A» it
appears to be a disease which a person is liable to ex-
perience only once in his life, could it not be prevented
bj inoculation ? These arc questions intended merely
to suggest inquiry. I feel certain, however, that
by inoculation this disease would soon be as
little known as small-pox In the successful înooula
tion of cattle for pleuro-pneumonia, we moy easily
see that inoculation ior the hooping cough would
aa\e the life of muny an infant, lor it is to infants
that the hooping-cough pro\es chiefly fatal. Fur
anything that is known, the pleuro-pneumonia dis-
ease of cattle may be similar to the hooping cough m
thebumantubject, and the hooping-cough might provo
as fatal to the higher as pleuro-pneumonia is to the
Um cr clafB of animals, were it not for the more easily
excitable spasmodic action in the case of the human
subject. Having some knowledge of pleuro-pneu
mouia, from observation and experience, I have been
struck with the remarkable similarity the expectorated
matter in hooping-cough bears to that found in and
around the respiratory organs of cattle which h.i\e
died from pleuro-pneumonia.
BituTAL TouTunn ov ,v Ciutn BY HIS FATHER -At
Lambeth Police Office, on tho 3rd of March, William
Fry, a jobbing carpenter, who had been taken on a
warrant, was placed at the bar before Mr. Elliott on a
charge of torturing a child. Mr. Clifford, the re.
lieving cflicer of Camberwell parish said, that on
Fiidby afternoon last a poor little boy ef eleven ycai«
of age, very thinly elad for such a time of year, and in
astute ot greatexhaustion, was brought to him to the
workhouBe, and on examining him he was quite
shocked at finding an iron manacle weighing upward""
of two pounds, made fast to his instep. It consisted
of a thick iron belt, Becured at both ends with a strong
bolt and screws, and attached to this bolt was passed
the end of an S hook, of sufficient strength to control
an elephant. On questioning the boy he said that f >r
at least ten months he had been compelled to wear
this formidable shackle, and that it was by the
merest accident he was enabled to get at u
chopper, by which he had managed to release hi-n
self from the blcck to which it had been made fait,
and then escaped from the houee of his father. So
BGCure was the manacle he (Mr. Clifford) had at-
tempted to describe, and which he produced for his
worship's inspection, that he had to go to a black-
smith's Bhop to get it off ; and after it was removed,
and the poor boy attempted to wulk without it, he
could scarcely do BO. lie bent backward and for-
ward several times before he could move from the
Bmith's anvil. On examining that part of the right
leg round which the iron belt had been placed, he
found it much wasted, and apparently bent, and
very different from the left leg. His whole frame
also appeared emaciated, so much so that it was per-
fectly apparent the pour little fellow had been
giOBBly neglected, and had not had sufficient food ;
and in proof of this, on placing him in the scale he
only weighed 36 lbs. The psor little fellow
seemed in the greatest terror of being taken
back to his father, and, crying piteously,
begged of him (Mr. Clifford) not to do so. On
Fiiday night the prisoner called on him, and he then
told him he must attend before a magistrate at this
court to answer the charge of assaulting his son. The
prisoner, however, said he should not attend unless
compelled, and he (Mr. Clifford), in consequence,
applied for and obtained a warrant for his apprehen-
sion. Mr. Clifford here placed on the table in front of
the bench the manacle spoken of, and the block to
which it had been attached, the latter being found
in the washhouse from which the poor child had
made his escape, and both weighing nearly twelve
pounds. The exhibition of these extraordinary and
formidable implements of torture applied to a mere
child, created a perfect feeling of astonishment and
diEgust. John Purdy stated that on Friday afternoon
UBI he was at work in a nursery ground adjoining
Woodbine Cottage, the residence of the prisoner,
and Baw the little boy come through the hedge
with the irons attached to hiB left leg. He told him
he had just released himself from a block, and he
(witneBBj took him to the next police station. Mr.
Rogers, a retired mariner, residing next door to the
prisoner, Baid that for the last niue or ten months he
had frequently seen the boy in the yard of his father's
house dragging the log produced about, and carrying
pBils of water into the house. He was generally
lightly elad, and did not appear near the size now
that he did twelve months ago. Harriet Coggins,
who also lives next door to the prisoner, deposed to
the same facts, and added that she had frequently
seen prisoner's children locked up in the wash-house,
and had on many occasions given them food, as
they complained of not having had enough to eat.
Edward Mark Fry, a poor emaciated little fellow,
who was clothed in the workhouse dress, was here
examined by Mr. Elliott respecting the nature of
an oath, and having answered with much intelli
gt ne'e, he was sworn, and said he was eleven years
old, and that his father's family consisted of a sister
older than bimBelf, a brother younger, and a step-
mother. He had been to Behool, but it was so long
»ince that he forgot the time. Towards the latter end
of the winter before last it was that his father first put
the irons on his leg, and made them fast to the block,
and the irons remained on from that time until Friday
last, when he by chance got hold of a chopper and
chopped away until the staple came out, and ho mode
his etcape. Mr. Elliott : What was the cause of the
irons being put on ? Witness : Because my little
brother and myself spent a halfpenny I found under
the grate in the buck parlour. Mr. Elliott : I suppose
the irons hutt your leg very much ? Witness : Yes,
sir, it did at first very much, but not so much when I
got used to it; it used to hurt me much to drag the
log after me. Mr. Elliott : What was done at night ;
WOB the log tnken off? Witness: At first
I used to sleep on an old coat and
trousers in tho washhouse, and at that time
father used to take the log and make the iron fast by
a lock to a staple in the floor, close to the place whore
I lay. In the morning he unlocked it again, and
Inste ned »n iron to the block again ; but for the lost
ele-ten months I think it haB not been off a', all. I
had to carry it up stairs cverv night, and down in the
morning. Mr. Elliott-What ! and always sleep
with it on ? Witness-Ye«, sir, it was always on.
This question and answer produced a perfect burst of
indignation from all parts of the court. The witness
here repeated the manner of his escape, and said a
gentleman had just taken him to the station-house,
and he was sent from there to the workhouse.
In answer to further questions, ? the poor child
said that neither himself nor his little brother
was allowed to toko meals with his father and
mother, in.law-, but his sister was sometimes. They
were locked in the wash-house, and were allowed a
small quantity of meat on Sundays, but on other days
they hod nothing but dry bread and a few potatoes,
but not enough. Policeman 81P said he apprehended
i he prisoner on the day beforo on a warrant, and on
telling him the natuie of the charge, he replied,
"" Here's a pretty mc66 I'm in for merely correcting o
boy. Had I let him run about the streets he would
have been in a reformatory."" He also said that there
were two others as bad as thiB boy was, and that he
could not keep his tools from them. The prisoner, in
reply to the charge, said that before ho began to
"" correct "" the boy, he waa connected with a gang of
thieves who infested the neighbourhood ¡ bul this the
boy denied. Mr. Elliott observed that he could not
truBt himself to speak of the conduct of the prisoner
as he felt, and should therefore send him beforo
another tribunal to be punished as his serious offence
deserved. The prisoner was then fully committed for
trial at the ensuing Surrey sessions.-London Evening
Sun.
AmtKST Ol' A MuiinmiBli.-The Cornwall Chronicle
says :- Flanders, the supposed murdererof the poor in-
fant. Mary Ann Riley, near Bagdad, has been arrested.
As Flanders, like the murderer Healy, fled towards
Jeruselem (as if that quiet village was an actual city
of refuge), we presume he has been arrested in that
locality, or in the direction of Mount Dromedary,

'Ibis was an application for new trial on tho ground
that, lho damages aw arded to the plaintiff were excessive.
HÍB Honor refused tho application bocauso the question of
damages had been left to tho Judge and determined by him
at tho trial. Mr. Pilcher appeared in support of the
application, and Mr. S. C. Brown opposed it.
HAM.SDON V. OAKMNEU.
This also was an application for now trial, made on
behalf of tho defendant, against whom a judgment had
been obtained on an order for tho payment of £30 tnado by
him in favour of ono O'Brien. Tho ground of tho applica-
tion was that the order was not an oidor in which tho
defendant promised to pay any amount. For tho pkintiff
it was contended that defendant's order'was a guarantee for
(ho perfommncoof a contract taken by O' Brien from the Cor-
poration. Tho aflidavit of one of the' professional gontlomon
engaged in tho caso slated that tho Judgo had held thnt
the order was a good and valid dooumont in law, and that
that was the ground of the decision. With respect to tho
| order, his Honor held a different opinion, and a new trial
must thcroforo bo granted. Mr. Gannon appeared in sup-
port of the application, and Mr. G. C. Davis opposed it.
îiAvrs v. iionoiiGir OP PADDINGTON.
The plaintiff in this caso h id been tho Council clerk to
tho borough of Paddington, and ho now sued the defendant
for wrongful dismissal. He claimed £160 damages. Mr.
Pigott appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. S. C. Brown for
tho defendant. The agreemont undor which the plaintiff
served tho Council provided that the engagement
might be terminated by cithor party on a
month's notice. Mr. Brown objected that tho
new Municipalities Act conferred oxprosaly upon the
mayor of any borough power to diBmiss any of tho servants
of tho borough, and that it was not competent for the
Court to review the mayor's dotormination in that respect.
His Honor was ef opinion, on the provision cited, that tho
power of suspension was delegated to tho Mayor, and that
the power to dismiss rested with tho Council. He hold
that it was competent for him to review tho dismissal by
tho Council. Tho evidence showed that tho plaintiff was
suspended on the 9th of Juno, and that tho sus-
pension was confirmed by tho Council al its next
meeting, held shortly afterwards. Plaintiff's testimony
shewed that tho mayor of tho borough (Mr. Taylor) told
him that ho only suspended him because ho was askod_ to
do so ; Taylor admitted that ho had no fault to find with
him, and spoke highly of his efficiency, Messrs. Penfold
and Peate, aldermen of tho borough, gave evidence to the
effect that tho plaintiff had at all tunes performed tho duties
of his office in tho most efficient and satisfactory manner ;
while, on tho other hand, Aldermen Humphrey and Stone
states that tho plaintiff had inaccurately kopt the minutes,
withheld certain vouchers, whereby tho borough lost tho
Government endowment for tho half-year-that he had
diEobcyed orders, and had been disrespectful to tho Mayor,
in practically calling him a liar on the occasion of a public
meeting, and again at a meeting of tho Council. Theso
allegations were contradicted by the plaintiff. Tho minutes
of Council contained no record of the cause of plaintiff's
dismissal, and tho only evidence on this point was in tho
vorbal report of the mayor, who thon stated
that he had suspended the plaintiff because his
conduct was distasteful to a majority of tho
aldermen, and because he bad no confidence in him.
Mr, Taylor (the mayor of tho borough) sworo that ho did
sot dismiss Davis in consequence of any ill feeling, but
simply becauso on ono or two occasions Mr. Davis had
asserted that he (witness) was a liar, and that Davis had on
more than one occasion altered things in the account-books
in opposition to his (tho mayor's) instructions. Ho was of
opinion that Davis was out of his mind at times. [At this
Btagc of tho caBc, his Honor intimated ho was of opinion
that plaintiff had been wrongfully dismissed ; that
if there had not been any ill-feeling in exist-
ence, plaintiff would never havo been dismissed.]
Mr. Brown «intended that tho mayor of a municipality
had the power to suspend a clerk or servant, at any time,
who in his opinion was guilty of misconduct; such suspen-
sion, of courso, would bo subject to csnfirmation by tho
Council. In this instance, tho Council had confirmed tho
suspension, that Davis had no right, boing a servant of tho
Council, to have attended any public meeting of tho rate-
payers, and; that Davis, having charged the mayor with
telling falsehoods was quito sufficient cause for his dismis-
sion. Tho utmost that could bo claimed by tho
plaintiff was,"" a month's pay. Mr. Pigott con-
tended that plaintiff was entitled to a year's
salary, tho contract having been for that period.
His Honor was of opinion that he had jurisdiction to
consider the question whether tho plaintiff hod been
wrongfully dismissed. He did not think that it was evor
the intention of the Legislature that the Council clerk
should be entirely at the meicy of tho Council, and should
be deprived of all resort to a Court of law. As a matter i
of fact, he was of opinion that tho defendant had been
wrongfully dismissed by the Council. He was disposed to
think that the plaintiff had shown a spirit of |
par'ialify, and had been guilty of conduct
which was unbecoming, and which would havo
justified the defendant in giving him a month's
notice ; but he did not think that that impropriety of con- j
duct was sufficient to justify his summary and absoluto
dismissal. He was of opinion upon the ovidenoe that tho
plaintiff had not been dismissed for misconduct, but becauso
he did not givo satisfaction to a majority of the aldermen.
The contract was for a year¿ and that contract had not
been determined by the notice in writing required to be
given under it. Ho thought that £50 would bo sufficient
to compénsalo tho plaintiff, and ho directed a verdict to bo
entered for that sum.",The Sydney Morning Herald ,"665,119,627,412,795,825,826,828,827,624,353,798,830,827,827,826,833,828,825,828,823,824,826,855,833,791,558,804,837,835,836,840,837,834,837,837,837,834,832,837,834,836,837,836,835,837,835,836,835,834,835,833,835,831,834,834,834,835,830,836,837,835,837,837,837,838,837,835,837,838,838,839,837,838,838,837,837,837,835,839,835,836,837,830,838,835,838,834,839,838,834,837,837,838,839,839,838,860,838,837,860,841,840,843,861,840,839,840,834,838,840,839,839,298",Sat 21 Nov 1868,"6135,6173,6198,6236,6264,6290,6320,6350,6382,6413,6452,6473,6503,6534,6565,6596,6626,6656,6688,6719,6750,6779,6810,6835,198,228,263,289,320,350,382,412,445,477,505,536,567,598,629,659,689,716,751,782,813,844,874,904,934,965,997,1028,1058,1090,1119,1151,1182,1212,1244,1274,1305,1336,1366,1397,1428,1459,1490,1521,1545,1581,1612,1643,1674,1704,1735,1765,1797,1827,1858,1888,1919,1950,1980,2011,2043,2073,2104,2129,2165,2196,2221,2257,2288,2317,2344,2380,2410,2440,2471,2497,2533,2564,2594,2626,2656,2687,2718,2748,2778,2809,2840,2866,2897,2932","1276,1549,1196,1414,1227,1196,1197,1195,1196,1196,1432,1226,1195,1196,1195,1197,1195,1197,1198,1196,1196,1197,1198,1171,2083,2082,2217,2112,2080,2079,2080,2079,2078,2077,2078,2077,2078,2078,2079,2077,2077,2077,2077,2077,2077,2076,2078,2077,2077,2077,2077,2077,2077,2077,2077,2077,2078,2077,2076,2076,2076,2076,2076,2075,2075,2075,2075,2076,2075,2074,2074,2073,2074,2074,2073,2074,2074,2072,2073,2072,2072,2071,2071,2072,2072,2072,2071,2074,2070,2070,2071,2070,2071,2070,2069,2069,2070,2069,2069,2070,2069,2068,2068,2065,2068,2069,2069,2068,2068,2069,2068,2067,2069,2069",13175999,Page 5

At the request ol a number of members
Mr. R. Grice lia» decided to stand for one of
the vacancies on the V.lt.C. committee, and
hi« nomination was handed in on Tuesday.
Mr. Grice haa previously acted as a com
mitlecman, and lie I as such a wide circle of
friends that hischunce of election is regarded
as a good «ne. Mr. J. C. Walker's nomi-
nation is also in, but Mr. J. C. Howden, who
has been mentioned as u certain candidate,
has not yet been uomiuated, though ho
probably will be in tho course of a day
or two. There are eight vacancies to fill
at the annual meeting of the members on
August 7. The retiring members of the
committee aro Mcsirs. W. If. Croker, C. B.
Fisher, C M. Ll^yd, W. Lonard, S.
Miller, F. Madden, J. Whittingham, and
G. Watson, all of whom, it""is understood,
will offer themselves for rc-clent.ion.

{From the London Review.)
ONE of the most remarkable facts which the
historian of the future must take into account
in estimating the forces that have governed
progress in our age and country is, in spite of
Mr Buckle, the individual influence of a great
man. At whatever department of thought we
glance, we distinguish, by comparison with the
conditions of twenty years ago, the unmis-
takable stamp of one mind. Within the period
named, the experiential school of philosophy,
which had almost disappeared from the country
of Locke, driven out by a crude deluge of
German transcendentalism, has been raised
almost to scientific perfection, has been formu-
lated, criticised, cleared of obscurities. In-
ductive logic, since Bacon's time practically
regnant in England, has vindicated as well a just
philosophical supremacy The great problems
of social and intellectual freedom have been
boldly shaped into a grand code of tolerance, to
which even bigots are now compelled to yield
at least a lip worship Among our public men
and writers a broader view of responsibilities,
class pretensions, and national claims has begun
to prevail Both in theoretical and practical
politics the narrow selfishness, which aped
Utilitarianism but was really its antithesis, has
been to some extent discarded and now, if we
have not quite escaped the taint of party bitter
ness in political discussion,we have at all events
the gratification of seeing that the number is
ever increasing of thinkers and even statesmen,
who set philosophy above intrigue and petty
private interests On the whole we are
justified in the boast - though we see
more promise as yet than performance
that this generation is less the slave of
prejudices and formulas, more earnest, more
thoughtful, more logical than that which imme-
diately preceded it It would be difficult to
over-estimate the share in this distinct and
welcome advance which is due to the personal
influence of Mr John Stuart Mill.
Mr Mill's earlier appearances as an anony-
mous wrnter were of a very varied kind
Poetry, history, and fiction, were among the
subjects of his keen impartial criticism But
after the publication of his great works on
political economy and logic, wc find that he
limits his labours to the severer walks of study,
in which he has become illustrious is an
authority 'Hie third volume of his collected
essays, which lies before does not include
any enuc d discussions such as these on Alfred
de Vigmy in the first volume, and on Michelet's
History of France in the second Politics and
metaphysics divide tins latest republication of
Mr Mill's periodical writings Under the
former he id ni ty be included the valuable papers
""'Thoughts on Parliamentary Reform,"" and
""Kettnt Writers on Reform,"" winch appeared
during tht discussions attenelant on the appear-
ance ol Mr Disraeli's Bill of 18V), as also ' A
Few Words on Non-intervention,"" and "" Hie
Contest in Amené i,"" rejinnted from /Vene; t
JUai/tizitir 'Hie el.iboi ite and exhaustive
criticism on ' Vustin s Lectures on Juris
piudcncc"" occupies to s0nie extent a neutral
ground between the foregoing strictl) political
et-sajq, and the two importint contributions to
mental science whim lorni pirt of the same
volume-tin disstnations on Ham's Pi)clio
log),"" and "" Grotc's Plato '
The governing principle of all Mr Mill's
teaching, whether in polities, in social science,
or in philosophy, may be fairly descrubed as an
enlightened and systematised individualism li
we assume, »t is tlie almost tinivcrsjl custom
with Englishmen, that any attempt to base
society on the idea of fraternity must be per
nicious. and is to be denounced as Socialist and
revolutionary, we shall find in Mr Mill's system
the most admirable type of modern develop
ment Where the political economy of others
is hard anti narrow, his takes a broader view,
and docs not arrogate an irrational dominion
over the higher instincts of human nature
Thus we find that ulonc, after Adam Smith, Mr
Mill has put Ins favourite science into i form
not repulsive to those bene'olent aspirations
which no science can extinguish in man In
the same way he has softened down the harsher
traits of the utilitarian philosophy, as it derived
itself from Bentham In politics, the tin
Radicalism of his fathtr, James Mill, and his
school, has been vivified and informed with i
new soul by that noble chapter in the "" Political
Economy ' on ' '1 he Probable Futurity of tne
Labouring Classes, ' by the "" Essay on Liberty,
and the ' Representative Government"" And
those students ol mental philosophy who wotilel
have rejected the gross materialism of Hartley
and Condillac can recognise in the refutation
of Hamilton a metaphysical theory which
neither revolts the logical sense nor the
spiritual nature It is this apt combination of
the strictest principles of individualism with a
generous enthusiasm for everything that is just
and noble, which has gained for Mr Mill his
wide and potent sway over the mind of
England Resting as that sway does, on the
free allegiance of the mest enlightened and the
most ardent spirits among the younger genera
tion of Englishmen, it must, beyond question,
be extended and strengthened with mere lapse
of time How far this philosophy can be con
sidered an ultimate growth admits of more
doubt It ein only be supplanted, however, ii
at all, by a system based on the solidarity of
mankind, and on theories which only a few
thinkers in this country regard as other than
hopeless unattainable dreams
Almost cvtiy page of ihe volume befoie us
furnishes us with in example of Mr Mills
power over opinion To him is due the grow-
ing interest felt by the public in Mr. Hare's
scheme of personal representation, and the
glowing toleration accoided to its discussion
'lins plan is very cekariy the very apothcosis of
individuihsm in the domain of practical politics,
and, as such, will never meet with the approval
of those who regard rather the action of the
popular will through masses than the divlsion of
the State into little groups of personal interests
It is so very improbable that we can go so far in
the wat of recasting our institutions as to adopt
Mi Hare's ingenious machinery, that the ques
tion is practically taken out of the sphere of
useful debate, since we believe even Mr Mill
himself, in bringing it under the nonce of the
House of Commons, rather desires to assert
the principle than hopes to establish the
actual change A more real benefit, in our
present effort to complete some satisfactory
representative Reform, may be derived from
Mr Mill's sensible statement of the advantages
of grouping, in a redistribution of seats Wh lt
ever ma) be the fate of the fianeluse clauses of
the present Government Bill, no one believes
that Mr Disraeli's redistribution plan has an)
chance ol fav omable acceptation In this
point, however, the scheme of last year was
very little better, and was open to all the ob
jections which Mr Mill ably urges against
Lord John Russell's Bill of 1852 in view of
some probable modifications of the grouping
system being proposed by one or other party,
the following remarks on the radical vice of
previous propositions will be found interest-
ing -
"" ""i et, if the principle of combining several boroughs
was once admitted, what course could be more obii
t>ovb than to taut all the present boroughs, and nil
unrepresented towns of more than a certain amount of
population (bay, for example, oOOO), and leaving out
all those, w hellier existing as boroughs or still tobo
created, avhose importance entitles them to one mem-
ber, or more than one, of their own, to arrange the
others in groups according to geographical conveni-
ence, care being taken lo give to each group something
like the same number ol electors No reason is appa-
rent tilly this plan was not adopted, except the mis-
placed scruple against merging two existing boroughs
into one if what is now i borough is to beeomo
one ol a group, what difference can it make to the elec-
tors whether thev ure bound up with existing, or only
with newly enfranchised re electors 5 What couldbe
more abnurd than lhat dine anil ( hippeiitiam both

another, and with the aid of stringent measures
against all forms of corruption, tnere would bo some
prospect that the choico of representatives might
octiisioiiftllj be made on public rather than on pnv ite
grounds
'Hie papers in this volume, which onginally
appeared in I ra^r s Mm/iutur, were so widely
rend in their original form, that we need hardly
do more th in point to the fact of their rcpub
hcr.tion In "" llecent W riters on Bcforni '-a
criticism on the theories of Mi Austin, Mr
Hare, and Professoi Lorimer-was developed
that philosophical bias in favour ol plural
voting which was outlined in the "" Bcpre

experience in practical legislation has since
weakened Mr Mill's ittachnicnt A more

should still admire the generous sympathies

in Hungary was in some sense a foreign joke But
when, the Hungarians having shown themselves likely
to prevail in tins struggle, the Kussian despot inter-
posal, and joining his force to that of Austria, de
livered back the Hungarians, bound hand and foot, to
their exnsperated oppressors, it would have been an
honourable and virtuous- act on the part of Lngland
to have declared that this should not be, and that if
Russia gave assistance to the wrong side, England
would aid the right It might not have been consultent
with the regard which even nation is bound to pay to
its own safety for Lngland to have taken up this posi-
tion single-handed But Lngland and Prance together
could have done it, and if thej had, the HusBian
armed intervention would never have taken place, or
would have been disastrous to ItuBsia alone ,

doing it, was that thej had to bght Kussia five years

matched sooner or later by some free country , and
the time may not be diBtant when England, if she
does not take this heroic part because of its heroism,
will be compelled to take it from consideration for her
own safety

BEAR. IN MIND,
when disease undermines the health, and the physical
system has become prostrated, a stimulant that will not only
strengthen, but remove the c*use, should be immediately resorted
to. Mental distress is also a fruitful source of the break'ing down
of the constitution, and the ravages of this enemy to health are
truly alarming. For all such maladies,
HOSTETTER'S STOMACH BITTERS
have been found unsurpassed. By acting directly upon the
digestive organs, they remove the heavy, disagreeable fcelinj
atter eating, so often complained of by persons of a delicate tem-
perament. As soon as digestion is restored, the patient finds hil
strength increasing, and his general health improved.
Thousands of persons certify that it may be relied on in all
cases of weakness or nervous debility attendant upon sedentary
habits. The generality of Bitters are so disagreeablo to the taste
that they are objectionable to a weak stomach. This is not the
case with Hostetter's Bitters, whioh will be found mild, and
extremely pleasant. Balsamic barks, plants, and roots contribute
their restorative juices to render it soothing and strenc-thening.
Its basis is the only pure stimulant which has over been produced,
containing no fusil oil, or any other deleterious element. The
most careful and skilful chemists have analysed the bitters, and
pronounce them harmless. This is scientific testimony ; hut the
testimony of the hundreds of thousands who have experienced the
preventive and curative effects of the GREAT VEGETABLE
TONIC and ALTERATIVE of modern times is still moro con-
clusive. In Fever and Ague. Dyspepsia, Billiousness, Nervous
Complaints, Chronic Complaints, and general debility, it Is as
nearly infallible as anything in this fallible world can be.

INQUEST ON THE BODY OF GEORGE GAMBLE.
[FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.]
An inquest was held before Mr Brown, coroner for the dis-
trict, at the Weatherboard Inn, ""Western Road on the 17th
instant, upon the body of George Gamble, nineteen years
of age, who was killed on Thursday evening, while driving
a dray loaded with blasting powder, which exploded.
William McManamey, on oath, deposed: I am a senior
constable of police, stationed at Pulpit Hill, Bathurst dis-
trict , about 8 o'clock last evening, I was informed at the
station that there had been an explosion of two tons of
blasting powder, that was being conveyed on a dray owned
by James Melville, and driven by deceased, the powder
was the property of Mr. W. W. Watkins, railway con-
tractor; I proceeded to Spring-hill, five miles from the
police station; I there saw the body of deceased, it was
forty feet from where the dray was when the powder
blew up, the body was quite naked, the skin
being scorched off all over, it was lying on its
stomach, the hands stretched forward, some of the
bowels were twisted round the fence that encloses
the railway cuttings, I found the left foot of deceased was
about four yards from the body and through the fence; it
appeared as if it had been torn off by striking against the
fence; there were marks on the post of the fence as if the
body had struck against it; on examining the body I ob-
served that the head was nearly torn from the trunk, it
was only held on by a small piece of skin on ths lsft side of
the neck, the right side of the head, face, and neck had
a black, burnt appearance, tha skin and hair of the head
were torn off for several inches, the right ear was wholly
gone, the eyes were black and scorched , the jaws and face
were smashed, the arms broken, the right hip was very
black and torn inwards for a depth of from two to three
inches, and for a circle of six inches the flesh was gone. It
appeared as if the right side of deceased was nearest the
fire, the right leg below tbe knee was broken , the axle of
the dray lay on the side of the road, ten feet from
where the dray was at the time of the explosion, one tire
of wheel is some considerable distance further off, there
is no other trace of a dray left, one of the horses was lying
on his near side about five yards away , the entrails
were strewn over the road, the heart laying some distance
from the body, another horse appeared as if he bad been
forced along the road with great velocity, his back was
broken near the shoulders, and entrails forced out; a
third horse was found about thirty yards away, and had
been lifted from the road over the railway
cutting and fence enclosing it, he was quite blind; a
fourth horse had the off hind leg tom away, was scorched, and
blind, since dead , a fifth had the hoof torn off the hind leg,
blind, since dead, the sixth is very much scorched and
nearly blind , the harness is all destroyed; the banks at the
side of the road were much torn up , the telegraph wire was
blown off half a dozen of the posts, three panels of fencing
were broken, and posts and rails split about 40 feet off.
John Keegan deposed I have a contract with Mr.
Watkins for the cartage of blasting powder from the railway
station, Penrith, to No. 4 section Great Western Railway
extension, I1 helped to load deceased's dray on Monday
last, I objected to take the powdor in its then unfit state
for transit, numbers of the casks being loose, and the
powder escaping from them, Mr. Francis, and Mr. Watkins,
clerk of works, said if I did not take the powder some one
else would, and that my security (£100) would pay for a
good deal of the carriage; I, to save my security,
loaded deceased's dray, and two others driven by
my self, I felt the risk my drivers incurred
so much that I begged Mr Watkins not to
allow the powder to be sent, he did not interfere, as the
teams proceeded along the road theo powder was dropping
out, when riding up from Pennth this morning there
were traces of the powder all the way along, and on several
occasion when my horse trod on it the loose powder ex-
ploded, sending flame up to the horses girth.
Michael Redden deposed; I am a carrier, and was about
seven yards ahead of deceased at the time of the explosion,
had been travelling with him for two or three miles, de-
ceased was, when I first saw him a few minutes before the
occurrence, walking at the side of the dray, he was sober;
I saw powder along the road, it had dropped from the dray
in front of me, driven by Pat Keegan, after the discharge
I found one of deceased's shaft horses had been driven
under my dray between the wheels, I had some difficulty
m gotting the horse extricated from its position, no part
of deceased's dray or loading was visible after the explo-
sion, I saw deceased's body after it was found.
John Redden deposed; I was about fifty yards behind
deceased's dray, when the powder took fire a turn of the
road intercepted my view, mv horses turned round on the
road and knocked me down, when I recovered no dray or
loading was to be seen, deceased was sober, and did not
smoke, I saw the body of deceased after it was found,
powder was strewn along the road from the drays that pre-
ceded me; I helped my brother to get the horse from under
his team.
Patrick Keegan deposed; I loaded at the same time with
deceased, I heard my father (J. Keegan) refuse to
take the powder in the drays, which he after-
wards did at the instigation of Mr. Francis, the
casks were quite unfit to be moved , half on each load were
loose, hoops broken, and heads not tight, from the start
the powder was strewing on the road, they said to them-
selves often that they would be blown up , my father fol-
lowed as far as the top of Lapstone Hill, to caution us to
use every care for this time, and he would throw up the
contract before he would expose us to such risk again;
when the explosion took place he was about thirty yards
ahead, I was standing on the shaft of my wag-
on, I was thrown off , as I was descending I
was struck near theo eye with the telegraph wire, that was
just at same instant blown off the posts; I did not perceive
that it was deceased's load that exploded at first, I thought
it was my own , I started to run away, but seeing my load
untouched, I proceeded to where deceased's dray had been;
I saw deceased's body found, he did not drink any intoxi-
cating liquor, or smoke, after we started from the Plains.
The jury found a verdict of ""Accidentally killed, by ex-
plosion of gunpowder,"" adding the following rider, viz :-
'The parties in charge of the powder belonging to Mr.
Watkins, at Emu Plains, have not used proper precaution,
by not seeing that the casks were in a fit state to convey
powder.""",The Sydney Morning Herald ,"738,701,440,833,847,844,846,736,812,843,844,848,845,847,843,846,845,845,844,843,844,843,844,844,845,869,830,843,845,842,843,843,843,843,842,843,834,844,842,843,838,841,843,839,839,843,841,839,840,841,868,838,839,867,842,837,758,799,841,840,839,841,841,837,841,841,837,840,841,839,839,841,840,840,837,629,807,837,839,840,837,839,840,837,838,841,827,656,806,841,839,840,840,838,828,842,128,809,839,840,842,842,839,827,840,841,841,838,840,828,839,841,842,842,842,840,825,788,795,840,841,839,863,126",Tue 21 Nov 1865,"1300,1368,1400,1430,1460,1494,1523,1554,1582,1612,1648,1679,1710,1741,1773,1803,1835,1866,1897,1929,1959,1990,2021,2053,2085,2109,2146,2177,2209,2240,2271,2302,2333,2365,2390,2427,2458,2489,2521,2552,2583,2615,2646,2676,2708,2739,2770,2802,2832,2864,2895,2926,2957,2987,3019,3051,3082,3113,3143,3175,3205,3237,3268,3299,3330,3361,3387,3424,3454,3486,3517,3548,3579,3611,3641,3672,3703,3734,3765,3793,3827,3857,3890,3919,3951,3982,4012,4043,4074,4104,4138,4168,4198,4229,4261,4291,4322,4353,4384,4414,4446,4478,4509,4539,4570,4601,4635,4666,4695,4727,4758,4790,4822,4851,4883,4914,4944,4976,5007,5038,5068,5099,5128,5162","2928,2949,3078,2876,2875,2877,2876,2876,2910,2877,2878,2876,2876,2876,2877,2877,2877,2877,2878,2878,2878,2878,2878,2878,2878,2879,2878,2879,2879,2879,2879,2879,2879,2879,2880,2879,2886,2880,2880,2880,2880,2880,2879,2881,2882,2879,2881,2881,2881,2881,2880,2882,2881,2881,2881,2882,2880,2914,2881,2881,2880,2881,2882,2882,2882,2882,2882,2882,2881,2882,2882,2881,2882,2882,2882,2882,2914,2882,2882,2881,2882,2883,2882,2883,2881,2881,2881,2882,2915,2881,2882,2882,2881,2882,2880,2881,2882,2913,2883,2882,2881,2882,2882,2883,2882,2882,2882,2882,2882,2882,2882,2883,2882,2882,2882,2881,2884,2883,2915,2883,2883,2884,2885,2884",13121999,Page 13

.
Uva oable messages of this morning supply in a
brief form the opinions of several of the leading
English journals on the Victorian Constitution ques-
tion. Epitomised as these opinions necessarily are in
our telegrams, they are sufficiently comprehensive to
.how that Mr. Berry's policy is regarded with
much disfavour in England. The increase of
the German army is not alone obnoxious to
the Russians, but the German peasantry have
been memorialising the Chief Marshal of the
German Empire for a reduction, instead of an increase
of the army. Count Moltke told the people that such
» step was impossible now, and would only be possible
When European nations, acting under religious and
moral influences, recognised war as a national
calamity. The death of the Parliamentary representa-
tive for Liverpool has created a vacancy, the filling of
which is to be regarded as a test of the public feeling of
England with regard to the Beaconsfield regime. A
Tory and a Literal have been nominated. The advo-
cates of home rule for Ireland are supporting the
Liberal candidate, but the Liberal party seems to be
»putting up. It will be seen, also, by our telegrams,
that the Duchess of Marlborough, who inaugurated
the Irish Relief Fund, has repudiated the aspersions
cart upon the subscribers by Mr. Parnell's untimely and
ill-advised speech in New York. A South Australia 4
per out. loan of three and a quarter millions is on
the London market. Our commercial telegrams from
London do not report any change of consequence.
Thb P. and 0. Company's steamship Indus, which ia
to inaugurate the new fortnightly mail service between
Melbourne and London, will leave Sydney at noon to-
day» for Melbourne, en route for Ceylon and
Southampton, via the Suez Canal. She will remain
at Melbourne two or three days. It will be seen
by the mail notices in another column that mails
intended to be forwarded from Sydney by the Indus,
Jill be made up at and forwarded from the General
*Mt Offioe. on Tuesday next. Unregistered letters
will be received up to 8.30 on Tuesday morning. The
Indus is to leave Melbourne on Friday next
A third paper on the subjeot of the proposed aban-
donment of the Southhampton mail route between
Great Britain and Australasia, has just been issued
from the Government Printing Office. The rirst item
is a tolegram from the Chief Secretary of Vic-
toria to the Colonial Secretary of New South
Wales, as follows :-"" January 6,1880. Southampton,
and Suez contract being abandoned by the Imperial
Government, this Government purpose tosend all mails
after January via Brindisi and charge present
Southampton rates on letters, packets, and newspapers ;
division of postage between Imperial and Colonial
Governments to bo matter of future arrangement.
For the present, other colonies to account to Victoria
same rates as now. Your concurrence invited in
transmission of mails by fortnightly service via
Brindisi in accordance with foregoing. Favour of early
reply requested."" In reply to this the fol-
lowing telegram was sent by the Govern-
ment here to tho Government of Victoria :
"" January 9.-If we are to continue to pay your pre-
sent charges on correspondence both ways, and the
amount retained by England on correspondence com-
ing this way, besides Continental transit rates, we can-
not consent to reduce our present rates from here on
correspondence via Brindisi."" The Postmaster-General
in Melbourne then addressed our Postmaster-General
in the following terms :-"" 14th January, 1880.-In
reply to your telegram of 9th instant, I would beg to
point out that the proposed reduction in postage rate
on correspondence sent via Brindisi under new fort-
nightly contract will be no special advantage to Vic-
toria. The public of each colony adopting the
reduced rate will derive the benefit The ques-
tion of transit rates to be accounted for to Vio
toria by other oolonies can be better considsred when
sufficient data are obtained upon which to base an
equitable arrangement, as it is not the object of this
Government to make a profit out of the contract at the
expense of the other colonies. You are probably aware
that Italian transit rates have been reduced. South-
ampton route having been abandoned, it is believed
that Imperial Government is prepared to reconsider ar-
rangements as to division of postage."" Mr. Samuel
se_t a telegram in reply on the following day as
under :-"" Re your telegram of yesterday, we can only
deal with the present position of matters. If we reduce
to 6d. and hare to pay you that amount on all letters
both wave and have to pay England 2d. on inward
letters besides Continental rates, we shall sustain .
further loss on ocean mail services ; and, as we are not
prepared to do this, cannot consent to any reduction of
Brindisi rates."" Then in consequence of a paragraph
i which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald
our Government, on the 20th instant, dispatched
I tho following cablegram to Sir Daniel Cooper, the
acting Agent-General of this colony:-"" Last Septem-
ber Imperial Government notified proposed abandon-
ment Southampton route and reduotion Brindisi postage
to sevenpence. We replied,-No objection, provided
penny would meet Continental rates. Victoria has
since proposed reducing to sixpence, to which we have
objected. Now rumoured Imperial Government favour-
ably considering Victorian proposal. Strongly protest
against any reduction that will prevent our receiving
the fourpenco already agreed to be allowed on every
half-ounce letter."" I
At a'meoting, yesterday, of the Commissionappointed
to conduct the representation of New South Wales at
the Victorian International Exhibition, it was decided
to telegraph to Melbourne, asking for the allotment of
20,000 feet of space for New South Wales exhibitors.
It was stated during discussion that £10,000 would
probably be required to secure the fitting representation
of New South Wales at the Exhibition to be held in
tho sister colony this year. j
Several deputations waited upon members of the
Government yesterday, the majority of the interview»
being with the Minister for Works. Representatives
from the southern suburbs waited upon that gentleman
to protest against the proposed soheme of drainage by
way of Shea's Creek, on the ground that it would be
an intolerable nuisance to the people living in those
suburbs, and dangerous to health. Mr. Lackey pointed
out that the official reports he had received were
I opposed to the views put forward by the deputation,
but the representations the deputation had made
should receive the most thorough investigation.
In reply to a deputation who advocated the connection
of the Great Northern Bailway with Sydney at some
point near Newcastle, Mr. Lackey said that no time
was being lost in making arrangements for connecting
the Northern line with the Southern and Western line.
It was premature now to say where the junction would
take place, but he did not think the Government could
ignore the trade of the Lower Hunter when deciding
upon the point of junotion. Another deputation that
waited upon the Minister for Works urged upon
the Government the necessity for extending
the Great Western Ballway from Orange towards
Wilcannia, or some part of the Darling. Mr.
Lackey said that nothing could be done in the matter
until the surveys were completed. When they were
ready there would be very little delay in extending the
Great Western Bailway. A deputation representing
the fire insurance companies waited upon Sir Henry
Parkes, to ask if he would re-introduce to Parliament
the Firo Brigade Bill, which provided for the appoint-
ment of a general superintendent of brigades, and other '
changes that were much required. Sir Henry Parkes
said he was disposed to undertake what the deputation
required; but the measures already laid before Par-
liament by the Government must have consideration
before any other.' The subjects of the other deputations
had reference to the necessity of weighbridges at
railway stations, the removal of an encroachment on
Driver's Boad, Burwood, and a wharf at Greenwich
Point.
Early yesterday morning misty rain began to fall,
and by noon a steady drizzle set in, and continued with
but little intermission all afternoon and night. After
the warm dry weather we have had of late, this
change to rain and a cooler atmosphere has been very
acceptable, especially to those lucky enough to possess
gardens.
The Mayor of Sydney, Mr. P. A. Jennings, and
Mr. J. Davies, M.L.A., yesterday waited upon Pro-
fessor Reuleaux, the German Commissioner, as a depu-
tation from a preliminary meeting, for the purpose of
asking that gentleman to attend a complimentary ban-
quet which it was proposed to tender him prior to his
departure for Europe next nwnth. Professor Beuleaux
thanked the deputation, but stated that he would ac-
cept it as a favour if the whole of the foreign commis-
sioners were invited to attend the banquet. This
request will be aoted upon, and an influential com-
mittee is being formed to make the necessary arrange-
ments.
Mr. M'Dougall (of the firm of Sands and M'Dougall),
Mr. John Sands, Mr. Hugh George, Mr. Franks
(of the firm of F. T. Wimble and Co.), Mr. Dunlop
(of the firm of Dunlop and Edwards), and other
gentlemen interested in typographical pursuits, visited
the Government Printing Office yesterday, at the
invitation of Mr. Thomas Richards, to witness the
operations of a printing machine made by Messrs.
Dryden and Ford. Mr. Richards selected the
machine on the occasion of his visit to London in
1877, and also endeavoured to ascertain the most econo-
mical purposes to which it could be applied. At that time
he saw 32 demy-octavo pages printed at one impression,
but having great confidence in the capabilities of the
machine, he determined, if possible, to Increase the
number. The chases were rearranged and improved
here by Messrs. D'Arrietta and Potter, and the result
has been that the machine as it was worked here
printed sixty-four pages at a time. Mr. M'Dougall,
who has a knowledge of all the modern improvements
in the art of printing as it is pursued in London, ex-
pressed his satisfaction at the working of the machine,
and several other gentlemen present said they thought
it indicated a marked advance in economical printing.
The impressions were pronounced to be excellent and
the register good. The Government Printer has four
of the machines at his command now, and could, if
required, print with them in one day 1000 copies of
a book of 500 pages.
At the annual meeting of the Parramatta Hospital
held last night, the Bev. Canon Gunther was re
elected president.
The Quarter Sessions were continued yesterday
before his Honor Judge Wilkinson. Ah Pin was found
guilty of stealing a horse and cart, and sentenced to
three months' hard labour. James Singleton and
James Nicholson, alias Horace Dixon, for imperso-
nating at the recent eleotion for East Sydney, Were
bound over in their own recognisances for £40, and
one suretv in £40. to appear when called upon to re
ceive sentence. The case against Cornelius Biordan,
for inflicting grievouH bodily harm upon Joseph Brad-
ley, was not concluded when the Court adjourned till
Monday.
At the usual meeting of the Hibernian A. C. B.
Sooiety (St. Patrick's branch) the president, Brother
B. Gaffney, in the chair, which was held at the meet
. ing rooms, Punch's Hotel, it was resolved, on the
i motion of Brother P. P. Matthew Quinlan,-"" That
the whole of the proceeds of the forthcoming celebra-
tion of St Patrick's Day be devoted to the alleviation
of the distress now existing in Ireland."" The secretary,
Brother D. J. O'Connor, was authorised to communi-
cate the above to the other city branches.
A mew Public school at Bungendore, was opened on
Thursday by Mr. J. B. Bourke, J.P. There were a con-
siderable number of Catholics and Denominational school
children present, and several members of the local
Board united in the ceremony. There was a grand
demonstration, and addresses were delivered by the
Eevs. J. C. Dodwell, G. L. Nairn, and Messrs.
M'Jannet and Johnstone. Afterwards the National
Anthem was sung. The children and- parents wero
abundantly regaled. Prizes of books were given to
the children attending the Public school, and sports
and varied amusements were heartily indulged m by
all. The usual votes of thanks terminated the pro-
ceedings, which were very successful.
Tas annual meeting of the members of the School
of Arts, Balmain, was held in that institution last
night;-Major Jaques occupying the chair. The report
of the committee, for the past year, was laid before the
meeting. It set forth that the building was in good
condition, that means for easier exit in the event of
fire had been constructed, in the arrangement of which
the thanks of the committee were due to Mr. J,
M'Donald for tho valuable assistance he had rendered.
A new floor had been laid incurring considerable out-
lay towards the meeting of which the sums received
from the Skating Club had proved useful. The
financial position was very satisfactory, and the income
was economically employed. A regret was expressed
at the limited number of subscribers, and a suggestion
pnt forward to the effect that a person should be en-
gaged to enlist subscribers, to whom a life membership
might be offered, or membership at the rate of 12s. a
year. A referenoe was made to the successful scientific
entertainments lately given in the hall by Mr. W.
Mao Donnell, and »hope of their continuance held out,
provided sufficient encouragement were given. Tho
receipts for the year were £189 6s., with a balance
of £1 8s. 4d. from last year, making a total of £190
8s. 4d.; and the expenditure was £177 16s. Id.,
leaving a balance of £12 12s. 8d. to the credit of the
institution, and a deposit of £50 at interest Captain
Trouton moved, and Mr. J. D. Cronin seconded, the
adoption of the report. On the motion of Captain
Trouton, seconded by Mr. W. Mao Donnell,-Major
Jaques, Messrs. J. M'Donald, H. Perdriau, H. A.
Perkins, and J. D. Oronin were elected members of tho
committee, and, after a vote of thanks to the chairman,
the nrocee ____.« terminated.
About half-past 7 o'clock, yesterday morning, an
accident of a rather exciting nature happened at tho
Circular Quay. A carrier had just delivered a dray
load of goods on board one of the vessels lying opposite
Tslbofs wool stores, when his horse suddenly com-
menced to back ; and before the driver could reach tho
reins, horse and dray went over the wharf into tho
water, turning a somersault in their descent. Several
persons assisted to rescue the animal, but only suc-
ceeded in getting him olear of the cart. Some men in
a berat then towed the horse to the steps at the bottom
of Phillip-street, and attempted to get him out of the
water there > but in doing so the winkers carno off, and
he returned to the water and swam about for nearly
half an hour. At length a South Sea Islander got into
the boat, which again proceeded in the direction of the
horse. As soon as it got closo enough, the darkie
sprang on to the horse's back, fastened a rope round his
neck, and by this means tho animal was towed to the
wharf and eventually got on shore. Numbers of
similar accidents have taken place at or near tho same
?pot through the unprotected state of the Quay ; and
the matter of taking some steps to protect their recur-
rence is worthy of consideration.
A cobbispoîtdekt writes to the Perth Inquirer :
"" A West Australian from Sydney states that he and a
friend were three hours looking for the W. A. Court in
the Exhibition building; when sergeant Bowe, hap-
pening to come across them, politely showed them into
a corner with a paper placard on a few spear, and two
natives' skulls, which were the sole representatives of
the productions of the colony.""
A JIETUEN of the quantity of land in South Aus-
tralia alienated from the Crown up to the end of last
year is thus stated in the 8. A. Advertiser :-The total
area of South Australia proper is 243,244,800 acres,
and the quantity of land alienated for cash or on credit
up to 31st December, 1879, was 8,477,813 acres 3
roods 83 perches, the amount of the purchase money
being £11,444,600 11s. 2d. Of this amount,
£4,490,245 18s. 9d. is still outstanding. The cash
sales by auction during last year were 4908 acres 3 roods
22 perches. The area of land sold by private contract,
including small blocks in excess of area allowed on
credit purchased for cash, was 8623 acres. Purchases
completed are represented by 167,601 acres 8 roods.
The acreage of land alienated on credit during 1879

Thb Atg\t* states that some interesting experiments
with signalling rockets were carried out on Saturday
night, with a view to ascertaining at how greata
distance large rockets may be seen. It was arranged
that a number of them should be sent up from the
summit of the Observatory Mount in the Dandenong
Banges, and that observations should be made at tho
Melbourne Observatory. Mr. Walter Draper, of
Elizabeth-street, at whose instance the experiments
were made, conducted the display at the mountains,
and most careful and patient observations were made
at the observatory, under the direction of Mr. B. L. J.
Ellery, Government Astronomer, by whom the altitudes
attained by the rockets and the results of the successive
experiments were noted. Able assistance was rendered
to him by gentlemen connected with the torpedo
corps. The experiments extended over an hour, and
during that period rockets of from half-a-pound to six
pounds, and of various colours, were sent up. A largo
proportion of the rockets could be seen by the naked
eye, but the colours could rarely be distinguished
without the use of the theodolite and suitable glasses.
There wero occasionally long intermissions in the dis-
play, which conveyed the impression that somo of the
rockets could not be seen. The night was tolerably
favourable but for a little haziness in the atmosphere
at times. The experiments showed that the largest
rockets can be seen at a distance of at least 20 miles
from the spot at which they are discharged, but that
their colours become dim and mixed beyond that dis-
tance. The display on the whole was fairly successful
as an illustration of the value of rookets for signalling
purposes.
Fo» some months past (says the Tamworth News)
very little advantage has been taken of the right of
conditional purchase, the number of free selections
becoming ""smaller by degrees and beautifully less,""
until this week we have to announce that not a singlo
conditional purchase was made at the local Land Office
last Thursday.
The Lismore correspondent of the Tenterfield Star
reports that on the 19th instant a lad stated that while
carrying the mail from Ballina to Lismore, as ho was
coming down the ""Postman's Bidge"" (just beyond
Lismore), he heard a very loud explosion, and on
reaching the town a few minutes later he found that
the boiler at Glasgow's steam saw-mill bad burst, and
the fireman had been blown some distance, his skull
being out and perforated in several places, a large
wound having been inflicted under the jaw and a gash
in the temple, besides which the body appeared to bo
burnt and scalded all over, and a leg and an arm were
broken. The unfortunate man, who had only recently
given up the occupation of cook at an hotel in Lis-
more, died in a few hours. At an inquiry subsequently
held, the engineer of the a. s. Queensland, who was then
in Lismore, gave it as his opinion that the boiler was
not well constructed; but, as the fireman did not
take the precaution of blowing through the
gauges to see that they were unobstructed,
it would be hard to say whether the boiler
was too full or otherwise; consequently the cause of the
accident could only be surmised. The engineer of the
-yard ÍKjúght) (tates that ha told deceased, to keep up
plenty of steam, as he had let it get very low recently,
which he attributed to the man not being used to hi»
work. No verdict could of course be arrived at, but it
seems to mo that poor Robert Bowley's death was
lost in trying to do somewhat dangerous work with
which he was unacquainted, and which he should not
havo been allowed to undertake. His age was 36, and
aB he was only a short time in Lismore, and not very
communicative, nothing is known of his antecedents.
The boiler was driven about 40 feet backwards out of
its bed, an'l would probably have killed several others
about the mill but that it was just breakfast time ; it
Went through the rooms used as carpenter's and black-
smith's shops, and pieces of ii ou and debris were driven
100 yards away across tho river in front The ex-
plosion occurred at the open end of the furnace, or
ather abovo it.
Old mon seem to havo a hard time of it in the
Hobart Town Hospital. The Mercury says :-""Another
old man, described as 95 years of age, has been received
at the depot from the hospital. He was taken up in a
car, and when lifted out, for he could not move by
himself, wa. found to be in an utter state of collapse.
He was suffering from bed sores and was quite deliri-
ous. His attention could only be attracted by pushes,
and then his answers were incoherent and wandering.""
We are requested to state that Mr. Ashdown, solicitor,
did not instruct Mr. G. B. Simpson to prosecute in the case
of David J. Nowton.

The annual meeting of the Board and
election of three members in place of Messrs.
F. M. Young, C. C. Nairn, and G. Currey,
who retired under the provisions of the
Town Boards Act, 1891, was held at the
Public Library rooms, Main-road, New
Town, on Saturday afternoon. Mr. W, P.
Brownell had been appointed by the Board
to preside, and at 1 o'clock opened the
meeting, fixing the close of the poll for 6
o'clock. The candidates were the two re-
tiring members, Messrs. Young and Currey,
with Messrs. G. C. Bernard, F. G. Knight,
and J.G. Steele, Mr. J. Jeffrey, though
nominated, having withdrawn from the
contest. Considerable interest was taken
by the electors, and canvassers were at work
for most of the candidates. Mr. Brownell
was assisted by Messrs.1 R. J. Ellis and A.
Strathern as poll oUrks. The result was
made known at 7 p.m. to a considerable
number- of eleotors outside the Library
rooms, as follows :- G. C. Bernard, 198 ;
J. G. Steele, 153 ; F. G. Knight, 152 ; G.
Currey, 118 ; C. C. Nairn, 114 ; Jeffrey,
10 ; informal votes, 7. Mr. Browuell de-
clared Messrs. Bernard, Steele, and Knight
duly elected, all of whom returned thanks.
The Chairman of the Board, Mr. F. W.
Piesse, proposed a vote of thanks to Mr.
Brownell, but the electors (or some of them)
declined to hear him, and the vote was
eventually carried on the motion of another

the lot» of the Mary was held before the Marine Board. Tho
Prest wes not admitted, but from the information wo btv« been
enabled to glean, the following may be considered as tolerably
corren t. From the statement« of Ctptain Potten, the chief officer,
second mate, and several of the crew, it appeared the vessel sailed
from Melbourne on the 2nd instant, in ballast, for Newcastle
At 1 o'eloek on the monning of the 8th instant, the otpttin and
crew weio horrified to find that they had g t on to tht land at
Wreck Bty. On examining her compite, it was fonnd to be five
degree» in error, whioh led the vessel half a point too
much westerly. This was aoctnnted for from the ftot tail
tn iron lamp had been used in the binoaole instead of lone of
topper or brass, a circumstanoe it does not teem tho captain wa»
wa» made aware of until it wat too late. The Board felt to satis-
fied with the statements made before them, that they returned tht
captain and officers their certificates. The finding of the Board
was. we understand, to the following effect :-"" The Board find it
unnecessary to hold any farther inquiry, at they find ne blame to
be attached to Captain Postetl or his officer!, exospt that the dis-
turbance of the compass should have been discovered at ta earlier

COOK V. 11Y11NEÍ, AND ANOTHEK.
Tho trial of this case, which had already lasted two
days, was resumed and concluded.
It was on action bj- Simon Cook, a farmer of Illawarra,
against James Bj-mcs and William Byrnes, proprietors of
tho Mount Pleasant Colliery, to recover damages for the
pollution of a creek or small stream of fresh water which
ran through tho plaintiff's land, by coal from tho defend-
ants' worts. Tho plaintiff'B declaration put tho case in
two ways, first, that the creek had been wilfully polluted
by tho casting of coal therein ; secondly, that tho damiegti
had been the result of ncgltgenco. Tho defendants had
pleaded-first, a general doninl that thej- had dono any
injury to tho plaintiff ; secondly, that whatever injury had
been inflicted lind been the unavoid.iblo result of what thoy
had done in the lawful conduct of their businoss as coal
lumera.
Sir William Manning, Q.C., Mr. Darloy, and Mr. Salo-
mons, instructed by Mr. Maguire, appeared for the plaintiff;
and Mr.,Butlor, instructed by Messrs. Allen, Bowden, and
Allen, for the defendants.
Tho plaintiff was the lessee of Spring G rovo, a farm of
fifty acres, at Fairy Meadow, Wollongong district,
in the vicinity pf the Mount Pleasant Colliery. His
case was that a small stream of water which ran through
his and other lands in that neighbourhood had been ren-
dered unfit for uso bj- tho deposit of n largo quantity of
slocOc coal from the collierj' in question, ana that his farm
had boen otherwise injured from the samo cause. Tho
defendants' caso was that there had been no such injury,
and that although the creek might have boon partially fillod
up by slack coal, this had not been the result of any care
lossnoss on tho part of tho emploj-ccs at the colliery, but of
n land slip, the result of a flood, for which tho defendants
were not responsible. The evidenco was very voluminous,
and in'many respects very conflicting. Tho amount really
in question was a small one, but tho object of tho contest
was rather, it would appear, to determine tho genorol ques-
tion whether or not tho proprietors of cool mines in that
district were to be held responsible for damages of this cha-
racter. According to the plaintiff and his witnesses the
creek had clearly been damaged by the presence of a
quantity of slack coal which hod como down from an
immense henp noar the mouth of the mine-a result bl ought
about by the carelessness of the minors in allowing bo vast
an accumulation at such a place. Tho supply of water from
this creek had previously been regular ana abundant. Tho
water, although a littlo hard for washing purposes, hail
been excellent for every other kind of domestic use, but
since the conl had come down it had been quito useloss.
Tho waterholes had boen completely filled up, so that the
constancy of tho supplj- of water was to it great extent put
an end to, and such as was still to bo had was very bad.
The flood, too, bad carried tho slack coal over some of tho
cultivated land, and hod destroj-cd or damaged tho crops.
Cook had about forty head of cattle which had boen accus-
tomed to drink at this stream, but which could
now scarcely use ii. He had boon compelled
therefore to sink a well. Ho had offered to toke £20
in full compensation for these injuries, and for this sum to
clear out the bed of tho creek himself, but tho defendants
had refused lo give him that amount and had offered only
£10. According to tho defendant«' wltnosses the water of
this creek, which had always been a littlo brackish,.had
been in no way injured by tie influx of slack coal, which
was far less than had been represented, and was occasioned
solely by a landslip during a flood which hod brought down
at the samo time a largo quantity of soil. The spread of
slack coal over tho land to a small extent had rather a
tendency to increaso its productiveness than otherwise, and
tho catUo had in no way suffered. The^offer of £10 had
been tendered, it was sworn, without prejudico-that is to
say without admitting any liability-and only in tho hope
by dealing liberally with tho plaintiff to save all trouble and
expense. Samples of tho water from . this
creek were exhibited in Court, whioh sample«
presented a very uninviting appearance. It was contended
tint they had not been fairly token, but that the water must
havo been btorcd up, but this was denied. Some of this water
was analysed by Mr. Watt, from whose evidence it would
appear that its"" foulness aid not in all probability result
from tho presence of coal, but from that of organic matter.
It further appeared that watcrcrcsscs wore growing plen-
tifully in the creek, and that decomposed vegetable matter
might in dry weather help to make the water bad. Tho
water of the creek, according to Mr. Watt, was naturally
brackish, and tho slack coal from this'mino when settled
(as it. would, settle) ,at. tho bottom of theiBtreain when
' 'net flowing rapidly- would'« not pollute it as alleged.
There was nirtfccr evidence that a stream of water coming
.ut of the same seam of coal was quite pure, and was con-
stantly used for domestic purposes. Seme of the coal was
broken up in Court and placed in tumblers ef water, upon
which it left a slight scum, although without otherwiso
rendering the water apparently impure. The impurity, J
however, va« most positively «vom to by the plaintiff'« *
**""?""-~-i _.
.witnosBcs. Somo evidence was gone into on the part of tho
I ?'_.nti(T lo show that tho lond-slip, if it did canso tho dam-
age (which was denied), lind been the result of some mis-
management of tho excavation. This was mot by direct
contradiction on tho(pnrt of tho defendants. Tho ovidenco
was directly contradictory na to the quantity of slack coal
in tbo heap nenr the colliery, and in nearly ovcry other im-
portant particular, even ¡is to tho local features of tho
gi omul.
His IIokoh directed the jury that the plain ques-
tion for their deteniiiuation was whothor or not tho
plaintiff hnd mndo ont any claim to damages for
injurj"" sustained by him through any want oi duo core on
tho p'nrt of tho defendants' employes. Evory man had a
right to work n coal mine, but ho was bound so to monago
it as that his neighbours should not bo injured. Against
lend slips nud floods no amount of caro could guarel ; but
tho miners wero bound to exctciso duo caro and forethought
so ns when buch accidents took placo their neighbours
might bo «s little injured as possiblo by any escapo from tho
minc.

! Second Day. i
The above match was continued on Snturdaj, and was
again favoured by fine sunny w eather until about 4 o'clock;
and the increased inteiest taken in the contest was appaient
by the splendid r iterance on tho ground during the after-
noon Beforo tbo luncheon hour thero were not more
than 3000 spectators piesent, but as soon as business
was ovei m tne eity, visitólo bpgan to arrive aB
fast as tramcars, omnibuses, and hansoms could convev
them to Mowo Park Indeed the traffic for several
hours was co heavy tüat theie was considerable
difficulty in meeting it and the necessity of a double lino of
tramway along Oxfoid and Botany sheets was nerei so
fullj ieali7ed At 4 o'clock there must hive been 12,000
people r> lthm the cricket enclosure and the scene \ lew^d,
irom tho pavilion, was nxtiemelr pleasing The tenace on
the eastern side was thronged and round the ground, and
especially in the ncith vy estent corner, the spectators
weio packed m rows-in some places hnlf-a dozen deep
The fair sex patronised the grand stand m large numbers,
and tho accommodation hore was fully taken up Tho
pav ilion, too, w as w eil patronised, and in fact dunng-the after-
noon a considerable number of subscnbeis were unable to
find seats Many prominent citizens were present, and a
general opinion was expressed that tho asspmblage was one
of the most brilliant ev er seen on the Association Giound,
surpassing ev on the second day of the Intercolonial match
Hundreds of people walked to the giound, and no doubt
benefited bj the exercise until they reached the
load which runs lo the gate, wheie they viere
perforce compelled to swallow a large quantttv of
dust, which was raised bv the continuous passage of
hansoms and omnibuses borne attempt was made to
repair this road before the intercolonial match took place
but the stone u=ed was not suitable for tho purpose ns it
soon became pulverised and it is to be hoped that beforo
next season tho Corporation will remedj the present un-
pleasant stato of things lhere cannot bo a doubt that the
match now proceeding vnll result m a bumper benefit to the
Australian team, who will piobably receive between £600 and
£S00 as thei- share of the gato money , audit is therefore to
bo regretted that thoso who had the man igement of affairs,
huyo been so ngia in their economy of expenditure It
was expected that, m view of a liberal amount of patronage
on Saturday, a good band would have been provided, as in
usual on such occasions, but this compliment was not paid
to tho public, who wera not slow to notice tho circumstance.
Peihaps tho Australind team considered, with pardonable
v anita, mat their appearonco after a orilhant tour in
the mothei country gave tho spectators moro than
an adequate return tor their money but a good
many poison1- thought otherwise and ii was evident horn
the enthusi istie npplauso which greeted the eftorts of
the combined team on Saturday- that the Australian Eleven
would hay o acted wisely bvmnkinga bidlor populanty as
well as pounds shillings and pence However, thero
is no piolability of tho team playing in Sydney
again, and that ma* make all the difference The
cncl et displayed was very good all round though
soy oral of the Auatnnan team-notably M'Donnell-failed
to sco""o A Bannerman, who, it was expected, would
make a considerable addition to his tuns, did not do so, and
it was not until Blackham got m vy ith Murdoch thut tho
combined team experienced much tiouble Thnso two
batsmen kept then wickets up until the luncheon hour,
incieasing the scoro from 83 to 123 After luncheon the
runs weio fuithor increased to lZo, when Muidoch, nftei t

mon gave veiy little trouble, nnd when Evans
scattered the last wickot, tho scoro stood at 165,
oi 42 behind tho combined team Tho bowling
of Lvana throughout tho inmn_s was admirable,
and Midvvintoi and M'Sbme also performed success-
fully, but Gregory, Coopei, and others did not
como oft Tho fielding all lound was remarkably
good, and Elliott, though fal fiom vrcll, was only
second to Blackham behind tho wickets A\ hen tho com-
bined team made a start for then second innings an
ominous rumbling oi thunder in the south-vvoat heialdcd a
change in the-weather, and in a shoit time the skv became
overclouded, rendering the light cxtieruely bad foi the
batsmen Massie and C Banneiman again went to
the wiel ets fitst and were not long m commencing opera-
tions, Massie, much to the delight of tho stjectators scoring
veiv lapidlv Bannerman retned lust after getting into
double figures, but his companion remained at the wicl ets
until ho liad scored <j0 ruis, and was then bowled by Alex-
ander Massie played moio íecklessly than ni his lust
innings, and ought to hav o been caught out but it is moro
tliun likely that tho approval that gi rated his rigoi
ous hitting encouraged him to let out, when defenco would
havo been more prudent Upon the rotnoment of Massie,
Horan and Evans becamo paltn°rs, but thev had not beeu
togethei many minutes when the ram sot in steadily, and
compelled the plaj ers to seek the shelter of tho pavilion At
this ttmo a large number of spectators loft tho ground, but
eey eral thousands remained in the hope that the wcathor
would clear. As the rain continued, however,-the captains
o ; the respective teams agreed not to resume play until
Monday, and a general rush was made for the trams and
omnibuses, which returned to town uncomfortably crowded.
The Play.
Murdoch and A. Bannerman resumed their innings a fow
minutes after 12 o'clock, to the bowling of Evans and Mid-
winter. Tho first four overs wero maidens, and Murdoch
then drove Midwinter to tho on for a sinclo, but tho last
ball shot quickly, and took Banneruian's wicket. (2-21-60.)
M'Donnell followed, but in Midwinter's next over ho
attempted a drive, and was splendidly caught by the
bowler, who secured tlio ball with ono hand. (3-0-60.)
Slight succeeded him, and Murdoch hit Evans to tho terrace-.
fence for 4. Slight then drove Midwinter for a single, but
in trying to tit a ""yorkcr""from Evans he had his bails
trimmed. (4-1-65.) * Groube now joined Murdoch,_ and
scored a single off each bowler. Murdoch then snicked
Midwinter to the southern fence for 4, which brought 70
np. Three to Groube and two singles to Murdock resulted
from the next S overs, and then Murdoch getting a chance
at Evans, drove him grandly aloutr tho carpet for 4. (SO
np.) Seven successive maidens followed, the bowlers being
too well on to be trifled with, and Murdoch then
put a ball from Evans to mid-on for a single. Edwards,
who had Fhortly before relieved Midwinter, bowled a maiden
to Murdoch, and Groube, after cutting Evans for 2, was
smartly caught in the same over by Gregcvy in the slips.
(5-7-S3.) Blackham followed, and opened off Edwards
with a good oil drive for 3 : and cut Evans for a single.
Midwinter hero went on again in place of Edwards, and
' Blackham hit the third ball of the over for two. Murdoch
negotiated an over from Evans without scoring, and Black-
ham after getting a singlo off Midwinter, made a fine off
drive for 4 in Evans' next. The score was increased to 95,
. when another change in the bowling was deemed advisable
Coopev taking the ball from Midwinter. Blackham imme-
diately hit the first ball to tho terrace fence for 4 ; put the
third to log for a couple, and Murdoch out the last for 2.,
. The ""century"" had now been passed, and Blackham, by a
fine hit to the grand stand fence, added another 4 ; Mur-
doch now faced Cooper, and got a lucky snick off the first
ball for 4, finishing -the over with a hit to the off
:for n single. (110 up.) Threejmaiden overa followed, and
Blackham then hit Cooper twice for a brace each. A double
change was now tried, Garrett going on instead of Evans,
and Gregory relieving Cooper. The batsmen, however, kept
their wickets up until the luncheon hour, the score standing at
123. Upon resuming, the number of runs was increased in
three overs to 135, when Evans went on in place of Garrett.
Tho change proved a judicious one, as Evans in his first
over broke through Murdoch's defence. (6-65-135.) The
Australian captain played a fine innings all through, and
was applauded from all parts of the ground as he retired
to the pavilion. Jarvis succeeded him, and Garrett took
the ball from Gregory at the southern end. Two maidens
were bowled, and Blackham scored a single off Garrett,
Jarvis snicking the third ball to the fence. (140 up.)
Scoring now became very slow, only 3 runs resulting from
five overs. M'Shane then went ou instead of Garrett, and
?in his third over bowled Blackham, who had played a fine
vigorous innings for 36. (7-36-143.) Boyle, who was
apparently lame, succeeded him, but was beautifully caught
in the same over by Elliott. (S-0-143.) Palmor came
next, but after scoring a single was also well caught behind
the wicket by Elliott off Evans. (9-1-146.) Alexander
was last man,"" and he and Jarvis brought tho score up to
155, when the South Australian, after a useful innings for
11, was clean bowled by Evans. Alexander carried his bat
out for 6, and the inning's closed for 155.
About half-past 3 o'clock Massie and C. Bannerman went
to the wickets once more, on behalf of the combined team,
to the bowling of Spofforth and Boyle. Massie immedi-
ately commenced operations by driving "" the Demon "" for a
single. Pie then cut Boyleto the pnvilion fence for 4, and
in Spoffortli's next over, Bannerman hit the
first ball to the grand stand fence for 4, and
got tho next past the wicket-keeper for a single
' This biought 10 up, and Massie added another single for a
drive in the same over. A single to Massie, off Boyle, was
the next item, and tho same batsman hit Spofforth towards
the pavilion fenco for 3. Notwithstanding the bad light
the batsmen continued to score rapidly until 30 runs had
boen put together, when Boyle managed to get a ball past
Bannerman. (1-11-30.1 Horan now joined Massie, and
soon afterwards .Massie made a high hit towards
tho southern fence off Boyle, giving a chance to
Slight, who dropped the ball. Palmer now relieved
Spofforth. Two maidens wero then bowled, and in
Palmer's second over Mnssio hit him twice for 4, and
finished the over with a hit for a single. Ho then faced
Boyle, hit the second ball to long-on for 2 ; snicked the
next past fhe wicket-keeper for a similar figure, and drove
the last ball for a sincle. This brought 60 up, and an over
or two later Massie was nearly run out. The escape,
however, made little difference, as he was bowled by
Alexander, who had relieved Boyle. (2-50-60.) The
retiring batsman was loudly applauded on his way to tho
pavilion foi- his innings, which was marked by
dashing and at times lucky play. Evans joined
Horan just as 1he rain commenced to fall, and the latter
batsmau hit Palmer to long-leg for 4. Evans then drove
Aloxauder foi- a single, and negotiated the next over from
Palmer without scoring. The rain now carno down
steadily, compelling the players to return to the pavilion,
and, after waiting for some time, it was decided that play
Khoulel bo resumed on Monday, at noon. Tho following

NOTES ON PASSING EVENTS.
[KItOM OUU OVWX COWIES I-ONDKNT.)
AUOKT.AXJ), 20th January.
Tin; news from lho East Coast is hy no means
so good Ihis last week. At Opotiki, there is a
return of a stale of filings which is very far from
pleasant in the recommencement of hostilities
by (he natives in the line of murdering any
European or loyal native they can catch. All
along they were of course ripe for this, if the
opportunity had been considered favourable, and
the fact that for a considerable time nothing of
the sort was tried went to show that they were
deterred by fear from the course. They have,
it appears, entered upon it again, and this, more
than anything of more decided want of success
to our troops or loss to our men, is the real bad-
ness of the news.
The Auckland papers are a little too much
affected hy it, I think, and seem to lay stress
upon it as if it involved the loss of prestige, and
the undoing of work supposed to be done
already; but 'there is no good ground for sup-
posing that any change at all affecting the
ultimate position of the campaign has taken
place.
Colonel Lyon, who commands at Opotiki,
has, I believe, already taken measures to
repress the forward movement of the rebels,
and a short time will, 1 have no doubt, see
them driven back once more to their fastnesses
where they were to have been attacked some
weeks ago-a course which, if taken, would, no
doubt, have put a stop to the present evils.
Although a good many ambushes have been
set by the rebels, we only know of one victim
having been secured-a Maori of the native
contingent, named Johnson, who was toma-
hawked and brutally hacked to pieces. There
are more than suspicions entertained regarding
the position of many of the natives professedly ,
friendly in the district. No doubt, many arc
traitors, but that is not so remarkable as the
readiness with which we seem always to trust
these people again.
Lower down the coast the last stronghold of
one section of the natives seems to have fallen
to our attack with but trifling loss ; and we may
now consider that, with the exception of the
force at Opotiki, which is a conglomerate of a
good many sections of rebels,-there is now no
fear of a formidable resistance being offered to
our aims on the East Coast. Of course, it is true
that these people arc very easily moved from
place to place, and a little vigour displayed at
Opotiki rntiy soon cause the re-appearance of
ícbcls at Turanga-mii or at Waiapu. This, in
fact, is a main difficulty of our position, and one
not easy to provide against but by constant care
and watchfulness.
On the ""West Coast, at ""Wanganui, it is grati-
fying to find that something vigorous is at last
being done. The operations of General Chute
have not been characterised by any startling
display of military science or of original genius,
but they have been vigorous and well-timed,
and as such have produced better effects than
many more correctly planned operations would
hove done.
The loss of another field officer in Colonel
Hassard, of the 57th, is a great pity, as the
officers hare been very heavy sufferers already
in comparison with the men in this war. How-
ever, the moral effect on the natives of finding
Ile soldiers able to storm pas off-hand and
follow them boldly into the bush will be excel-
lent indeed. To the colonist, too, it is no small
gratification to find that the troops are to have
tile chance before they go to remove the re-
proach which was made against them of being
afiaid of the bush and of native forts. It is no
pleasant position for people of British race at
any time to hear sims cast upon the good name
of the British aimy, of which they arc proud
almost by instinct. A little beating will be
enough for the AVaneanui natives, for they arc
a chicken-hearted race, too cruel to be really
brave, and so esteemed even by their own
people.
1 hope General Chute may see their submis-
sion complete before the troops are all with-
drawn from the colony.
In my account of my experiences of the
northern part of this island (which is the result
of a careful personal inquiry into the facts), your
readers will have learned most of the local facts
of interest al present.
The discovery of a fine vein* of copper at the
lower Thames, in the neighbourhood of the
place where gold has been found in payable
quantities, but inaccessible, owing to native
jealousy, is a fact of some importance.
Copper has been known to exist for some
time in the neighbourhood, and the
proprietor (native) of the land is quite willing
to have it worked. It is said that there is a
good deal of the silver with the copper, which
will of course enhance the importance of the
discovery, if correct.
I am informed that a cominmy, with a capital
of £20,000, is in course of formation to work
the New Zealand flax on the plan discovered by
Mr. Purchas, some of which was in the Sydney
maiket previous to the Avar, and commanded
excellent prices. The present effort promises
well, as some of the best names in Auckland are
concerned.
AUCKLAND, 2'Jlh January.
To-day is the twenty-seventh Anniversary of
the founding of this colony, and all Auckland is
holiday-making in consequence. The weather
seems not to have proved particularly favour
i able to the regatta, which is our way of holding
high festival here on this occasion each year,
I and the absence of the old Maori element to a
great extent from the scene lakes much from
the romance of the affair. Formerly
it was the Maori festival j.ar excellence,
but for the last two years the natives
have not been on sufficiently cordial terms,
excepting to the North-and the Northern
natives never did much in canoe-racing-to come
in any considerable numbers to the regatta.
Were the Northern tribes removed or unfriendly
we should soon be much in the position of the
Australian cities, where an aboriginal native is a
comparatively rare sight.
The position of matters on the West Coast is
veiy greatly improved by the operations ""of the
troops under General Chute. In a former
letter I gave some details of his earlier
operations in taking the pas at Manu
taki and Manapawa, where Colonel Has
sard, of the 57th, was unfortunately mor-
tally] wounded. These successful operations
were, however, only preliminary to his larger
scheme, which he has now, in great measure,
accomplished. That was to penetrate from
Wanganui to Taranaki by an inland route, and
to take all the fortifications, and destroy all the
houses and plantations he could find on the
way. Starting with about 750 men in all, of
whom about 500 were her Majesty's troops,
and 250 colonial forces, either natives or Forest
Bangers, he forced his way through serious
difficulties of all sorts, the chief of which was.
the want of food, which was moro than once
very seriously felt, to the extent of obliging the
troops to eat horse-flesh, as tho commissariat
J»
fe ""*- -*
could.not keep up with them. On the march
about ten days seem to have been consumed'
and it is stated that in the various fights that
occurred on the route not less than 150 natives
were killed. Every fortified place was assaulted
and taken by storm, on the principle established
by the colonial forces on the East Coast, and in
all cases the defenders of the pas seem to have
been panic struck at the apparition of soldiers
actually rushing a pa before a single shot had
been fired at it from the traditional great guns.
General Chute had reached New Plymouth at
our latest dates, and had been received with the
greatest possible enthusiasm, which displayed
itself in the form ol triumphal arches and ad-
dresses.
The General's work, however, is not yet done
by any means. This march indeed is but the
first blow, which must be followed up with
others in rapid succession, unless it is to be
forgotten. He is quite aware of this happily,
and is about to recommence his march back
again, only taking the coast line instead of the
inland route.
At Warca, near the Patia Uiver, and on the
wonderfully fertile plateau that stretche3 away
southwards from the base of Mount Egmont,
there is reason to believe that the natives will
be found in very considerable force, and with
formidable works of defence. The country is
difficult, owing to the heavy scrub of manuka
and flax which occupies most of the district
and the natives are so fully competent to take'
advantage of this that it may safely be said
that the heaviest part of the work is yet to
come.
A continuance of the same fearless tactics
will, however, in the opinion of every compe-
tent judge, lead to the complete and early
success of the operations at Warca as elsewhere,
and loo much credit can scarcely be given to'
General Chute for the ready and able way in
which he lias adopted and applied to regular
military practice the lessons to be learnt from
the experience of the colonial forces.
The native contingent on the East Coast has
been gaining fresh laurels, and the rebels we
may hope have been gaining new experiences
within the last few days. The rebels who were
defeated so often by the combined native and
colonial forces under Major Frazer, retreated on
the difficult country at the head of the river '
Wairoa, where in the very inaccessible district
round the Waikarcmoana Lake, where the river
takes its rise, they considered themselves safe
from molestation. Such was not the view of
either Major Frazer or the friendly chiefs who
followed them up with about 400 fighting-men.
On the 11th and 12th days of this month a
severe scries of skirmishes were fought close to
the banks of this large and romantic lake
where the rebels had erected a pa of some
strength. The struggle seems to have been
severe, and the arts of the defending party were
so clever that it seems hard that they
should have proved so ineffectual. On the
second day the victory of our men was so well
established that the rebels, having lost their pa,
took to their canoes, and favoured by the fine
weather-in windy weather the lake is too
stormy for ennocs-made their escape, leaving
forty-one dead bodies behind them. Many, no
doubt, were wounded in the affair on their side,
as thirteen were on ours. The greatest chief of
the Wairoa was left dead by the rebels, as well
as five or six men of leading rank. Amongst
the loyal dead (twelve) there were no men of
note ; but old lhaka, a great chief and warrior,
who was, in fact, commander-in-chief, was
rather badly wounded in the thigh.
There is no news of further fighting at
Opotiki, but some may be daily expected. The
escape of some fifty-three native prisoners from
the hulk at Wellington, effected hythe removal
of a port and dropping into the water or a boat
on a stormy night has caused some sensation.
The principle of keeping these men shut up in a
hulk doing nothing beyond eating and sleeping
has long been condemned by the colonists, and
this second escape may perhaps stir up the
Governor to consent to some more reasonable
plan. They were offered to Otago as hard-labour
men, it may be remembered, bul the offer was
not accepted owing to a mistaken notion that
the chiefs would not work. The old proposal to
deport them to the Chatham. Islands
seems better than allowing the poor wretches to
make their escape and lose a large percentage
by drowning in the attempt-no less than six
out of the fifty-three arc known to have lost
their lives.
'Hie confiscation of half a million »f acres at
Opotiki, will throw into the Government's hands
some of the first land in New Zealand, and the
settlement of half the 1st Waikato Regiment
upon part of it will give security, and therefore
value to the remainder, which can at no distant
date be sold for a good price. The province
of Auckland is promised a further loan of a quar-
ter of a million to enable her"" to deal satisfac-
torily with the ceded Waikato territory, but
how the money is proposed to be used by the
Provincial Executive does not yet appear.
Mr. Weld, the late Premier of this colony,
has announced his retirement from public life
owing to ill-health. Had he done so before he
headed a Ministry he would have carried far
deeper regrets with him than he now can do
from most of the colony.
From the papers, per tho Prince Alfred steamer, wo quote
as follows :
Under the head of Native Intelligence, in the Southern
Cross, that journnl publishes somo ""gleanings"" on the
nativc question, which are not without thoir significance, and
for the accuracy of which it vouches.
Wo learn that many Europeans havo recently ponotratod
into tbo bcai t of the disturbed districts, amongst the Pal
Mnrire fanatics. With several of those tourists, wo have
had an opportunity of speakincr. Starting from Auckland, and
going up to tho Waikato and Thames countries, ono remark
is made by all tourists-namely the diminished numbors of
tho natives. On being questioned regarding the cause of
their decrease, they state that the loss by war did not nearly
so much niTect them as tho loss by disease. Affeotiona of
the throat and chest have been the chief agency in carrying
off (he native people ; and as they have, as a rule, gono book
to the licentious and communistic practices, in voguo
twenty-five or thirty years ago (amongst othors, the whare
piihi), theie can bo little doubt that the mortality witt
increase. . ,
Several gentlemen who penetrated into a comparatively
unknown country, in tho interior, were treated ovcrywhere
with marked respect and kindness. They attribute tats to
what took place a short time previously at Matamata, wita
Thompson. It would appear, as the natives report, that a,
deputation from all tho inland tribes, numbering about tut)
men, waited on Thompson, asking him to lead the tnbos ut
an attack on Auckland. Thompson isBaid to liave asked
.'Do you know tho way to Auckland?"" After a pauso,
the deputation repliod-"" No ; but wo look to you to shoir

once, and! lost one eye. If I try to take it again I fear to

Waikato is gone: if I mako war again I may lose

more. Thompson then added-"" As yea represent

TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD.
Sir,-I respectfuly ask a few shoit lines of space to bring
under criticism tho vote of the House on the second reading
of the late Government's Land Bill That bill did not in any
way interfere with tho mam principle of tho bill of 1861,
it left that principle intact, and on this giound alone should
havo been read a second timo by a House piotessmg to be-
lieve m the land legislation ot 1SC1 Su John Robertson
tried to introduce a Land Bill at the beginning of the
session which he stated, embodied all the amendments
required, evory principle m vthich bill was in the bill of
tho late Government, which Su- John Robertson voted
against
The rejected Land Bill greatly favoured tho free
selector, adopting all the main principles put
forward by tho free selectors at their Confer-
ence , and yet strange to state, Mr B irbour, the
President of that Conlerencc, voted against it In the
rejected bill tho free selectors were favomed to a degree foi
beyond their wildest hopes or expectations, nnd yet dozens
of members who havo always pioiessed to be the free
selectors' fast and steady fnends voted against tho bill
If any one can pluck out the heart ot this mystery, 1 ask
him to do so, because to me it is in olublt Iho free
selectors will never again get a bill so f ivoumblo to Ihcir
interests, and this was confessed bv such wami friends of
the freo selector as Messrs Dav, M'Elhono, and Bennett
Tho principal objection to tho bill, as enunciated bv most
of tho speakers, was the very (,rav o niattei oi interest on
tho balances of futuio freo selectois Ot com se, there
were many other objections, but I submit not one ot a vital
character-that is, that could not havo been easily
amended m committee I do not know anv bill ihut
over carno before Faihament that was better entitled
to bo read a second time, alwa\s bearing m
mind that the wholo Paihamont favoined the principio
of tho 1861 legislation Tho House could have stiuek out
with ease eveiy bo-called defect that was riomtcd out during
the lengthy debate, and a bill could havo been passed in
harmony, at least, with tho opinions of honorable members
This was not done, for reasons that I do not attempt to
fathom, but it might have ha\o been done it men had
acted up to their opinions If any Land Bill is introduced
by tho present, or any future Government, I will ventaie
to make this small prophecy with legaid to it uinneh,
that it will contain every manciple of the late rejected bill
with the exception of the abolition of interest on the balances
of futuro free selectors, and one or two other matta s or no
great moment
lhe proposal to raise tho squatters' rent to the extent
of £400,000 a year secured, m my op mon, the -elec-
tion of the bill, but let any Government attempt to
introduce a Land Lill without this must ughteous pio
posal, and that Government wul meet with \erv sudden
death I am sorry the people h id not a chance of speaking
and acting ou this most important matter
I obseire the Albwy Mannt) stiongly condemns ""Mr
Barbour for voting against the second loading of the bill,
stating that it contained threc-fomths ot vhat the Tiee
Selectors' Conference put ioith.as their wants
There cannot bo a doubt of thi3 that the whole body of
free selectors would have voted for the bill to a man, as well
they might, for they will never got such another bill
If there is to be no attempt to separate the two great
interests, pastoral and agricultural, the people will not m a
hurry get so good a bill as that which has just been
rejected, which with a few easily made alterations would
have been in unison with the opinions of every member of
tho House From what has happened the free selectors will
have little difficulty m discovering who are their li lends,
and I believe the lesson will not bo thrown away upon
them __ I remain, yours, dLc,
DAVID BUCHANAN.
