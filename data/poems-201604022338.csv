Or to watch for an hour beside tho cold

And by all who knew- bim half-idolized.

And j open their ] ngrs again und again,

T be niniks of his hniid, and again may see
'I lint dear young face, that manly face,
A\ ith thriè steadfast pyes looking straight at mo.

But the dust cn the le if, the moto in the beam,
For their countiy's good would turn them asido

And thus is (be siicnglh of all friendships tried.
Oh ! my boy ! I can lum from such thoughts as these

Tho Cory touch of unredeemed desire
Ho seeks the cleansing of the whirlwind fire
Of battlo to restore his íniuiei name
And placo it once again, and utthout blame,
Upon the mil to which bravo men aspiro,
Or, thro' his anguish, placo it even higher
Than theirs who, stainless, seek the heights of fame.

Of what our men are made, who seek m death

Make that of victory their bridal daj,

A quiet song for Ellen--
Tho patient Ellen Ray,
A dreamer in the nightfall--
A watcher in the day;
The wedded of the Sailor
Who keeps so far away ;
A shadow on his forehead
For patient Ellen Ray.
When autumn winds were driving
Across the chafing bay
He said the words of anger
That wasted Ellen Ray ;
He said the words of anger,
And went his bitter way :
Her dower was the darkness--
The patient Ellen Ray
Your comfort is a Phantom,
My patient Ellen Ray ;
You house it in the night-time,
It fronts you in the day !
And when the Moon is very low,
And when the lights are gray,
You sit and hug a sorry hope,
My patient Ellen Ray !
You sit and hug a sorry hope--
Yet who will dare to say
The sweetness of October
Is not for Ellen Ray ?
The bearer of a burden
Must rest at fall of day;
And you have borne a heary one,
My patient Ellen Ray.

[Melbourne, 1861.]
By R. H. Horne.
"" A plain unvarnished (but heroic) tale.""
What hopes inspired each brain—each throbbing breast—
As slowly paced the camels, with their packs,
Through Melbourne streets ! The town became one mass
Of people, crowding, anxious eyed, to take
A last look—-little dreaming 'twas the last
Burke, on his sturdy bush horse leads the van
Of that adventurous band, pledged mutually—
One to the other, and, within, us deeply—
Each man to his own soul. They go to explore
The vast unknown Australian continent,
From southern rivers and abodes of men
Northward to Carpentaria's homeless Gulf
Or die,—with dying hopes advancing still—
To the last famish'd man, and his unconquer'd will.
They journey on, week after weary week,
Through ways impassable, as Nature thought
When first she cast these deserts from her hand,
Unsuitable for life. But manhood, rare
In energy and fortitude, improves
Its Maker's gifts, 'till, hardening to the work,
The shaggy matted wilderness is cloven,
And opes her thorny breast to let them pass.
The camel pauses o'er the gorge's brink,
With obstinate nostril and averted stare,
But downward his uncouth machinery
Is led with skill, beneath its toppling pack,
O'er jagged rock and slippery boulder stone,
Until, once more, his dingy fabric rises
Into the scorching splendours of tho noon.
Resting sometimes by day, all night they march,
Measuring their course beneath the constellated arch.
Month treads on month, dangers and pangs are borne,
Of scanty water—oft with none at all—
Ten fold more terrible than hunger's fangs.
And thus undaunted, do they force a way,
Through salt-bush wastes, box-forest, mallee scrub,
O'er rugged deserts of the torn-up rocks,
Hills, long ravine and gorge, black earthy plains—
Darkening the eye to the horizon's verge,—
Loose and unsafe, with many a treacherous crack,
Deep as the shoulder of a stumbling horse,
Grey mud-plains, hard and pale as pumice-stone,
Boundless, and ghastly, with unnatural light,
Where the mirage presents clear pools and lakes.
(To one who lags behind, or gets astray),
And men and camels of the Exploring Train
Travelling along the necromantic sky,
Another Train, inverted, foot to feet,
Travelling beneath : both shadows!—-and all else
Of the reality, then invisible !
Saw'st thou yon Horseman, journeying thro' the sky !
I was Burke, the Leader!—oh, that desert prophecy!
Onward they plod, and struggle without pause,
Save for their measured sleep, and measured meal;
And in the centre of Australia's wastes
The foremost party stands. The Leader here
Selects three men, with him prepared to plunge
Into the wilderness, as yet untrodden
By human foot, and scarce by foot of beast—
E'en the wild dog. The carrion bird here paused
On prudent wing, nor left the Great Creek's bounds;
But onward moved the men. The rest encamped,
Remain with stores to solace their return.
Again the weeks creep on with these four men—
The leader, Burke, young Wills, with King and Grey—
Their life a constant toil, and nothing else,
Save one sustaining hope, their rest oft marred
By pestilent clouds of gnats, horn'd beetles, ants,
Marsupial mice and rats and, worse than all,
The ceaseless torment of the common fly
Attacking mouth, eyes, skin, by day and night.
So scorching is the heat, the natural course
Of social habits now must be reversed—
Breakfasts by moonlight, suppers in the sun
Amidst his earliest rays. Red sandy plains,
And hills that seem to bake before they blaze,
Must now be traversed. Thence, the different toils
Of the Great Stony Desert—hideous miles
On miles more hideous .But, ere long, the scene
Grows verdurous : creek after creek appears,
Great parks and forests, chains of water-holes
Full of bright fish; rich grass and pasture lands.
Here is no barren desert, as't was thought,
But a new region for laborious hands !
Thus on they fare, prairies and plains, each seeming
Boundless as oceans, by these resolute men
With devious steps, at length, are over-passed—
They reach the tidal influence of the Gulf—
The Continent is crossed ! What joy is theirs!
What triumph of the soul, and the full heart!
What sense of the Great Victories of Peace,
Which shall bring good-will among distant men !
With beaming and exultant eyes they gaze
On glittering swamps, and chains of reedy pools
Made rich with floating stars of many a flower;
Marshes of grassy emerald, streak'd with gold
Or touched with flashes of the rising sun,
Lengthening lagoons tufted with islets; brave
In flags and ferns, or mossy rooks and shrubs,
Where colonies of wild fowl swim around;
While overhead, in the cerulean sky,
Flocks of white pigeons gambol, poise, and flash,
And in the distance, 'midst these watery lands,
Grave pelicans on sandy reaches stand,
Flapping the showery arches of their wings,
As if in welcome, while the herons scream,
Like music to the ear of victory.
*Nothing of what is understood as imaginative poetry is offered
in the above story, which is simply on attempt to condense the
whole narrative, divested of all its prose details and technicalities,
and to give a few touches of local scenery.
Burke dips his hands within the tidal flow;
Wills also—King and Grey. Oh, freshening life
Where Hope perceives her long-watched, leafless tree,
Suddenly fruitful in the wilderness !
All wade into the streams, to make truth sure,
And the one chosen horse (Burke's. "" Billy "") dips
His nose, eye-deep, in the ecstatic flood,
And drinks as if he never could be full ;
Then sighs and snorts, and pricks his ears, and stares,
And tries to understand the common joy
Which yet he with his master shares. But Burke
All raptures soon controls. Brief time to pause
For rest on the inhospitable shore
Of their success. Hunger will drive them back
In less space than they came—perhaps destroy.
Already Death has visited this band
Of spirits heroic. Those who formed the rear
Journeying towards Cooper's Creek, camped at Bulloo,
'Midst hostile blacks, with fever and disease,
Were still too sick to follow ; man and beast.
One, staggering. said, "" Let me now shoe the camels,
Lest I should die before that duty's done.""
He shod them, and then died. Another lay
Prostrate in body, with a teeming brain.
Wandering 'tween Science and Delirium,
With Art to weep his epitaph. So passed
Thy spirit, Ludwig Becker,—cast away
By the "" ignorant present,""—scarcely named—and soon
Forgotten, like a common clod. O, shame !
O, sorrow ! and the more of both, because
His wrong is buried with him. Others died,
Of no note; noted equally,—and all
In the same list with the lost quadrupeds.
Meantime the Leader and his chosen three
Return to join their friends on Cooper's Creek,
Central in this vast continent. Sore tried
By ravening hunger, and with failing limbs
Onward they gasping press, each stop a pang,
Beneath a sun that burns within the shade,
Whenever shade is found ; and through the night
Aching, and well-nigh paralysed with cold,
They still urge on, for life hangs in the hours,
Morn toiling after morn as t'were the last,
Yet still another claiming equal toll,
And more, from their lost strength. Severely urged
The camels sweat with fury and with fear,
Bleeding and groaning 'neath their galling packs.
The store of food fast fails. One camel now—
And now a snake they eat, whereby, it seemed,
Burke sickened, as did Grey ; and Grey succumbed,
From the intolerable suffering of the march
Thus forced by want, and down he sank, like one
So craving rest, he had no thought beyond ;
Nor of his last words have we any note,
Nor of the spot where lie his mouldering bones.
The Leader still, with Wills and King, holds as
Dragging his wasted and exhausted form
By energy of will, and only fed
With confidence in succour waiting them
At the great Central Creek. There they will find
Food, clothing, sleep, congratulating friends,
And heavenly rest of limbs, midst tears of joy.
The goal, so achingly desired, at last is reached
By these three worn-down, yet victorious men—
And all is vacancy !—the camp broken up !
Deserted—man and beast !—their friends are gone
Not one remains !. A scored tree-trunk imparts
The dreadful truth—the blank dismaying news !
The heart-depressing strait that few foresaw,
Yet all should have foreseen as possible,
And all with care forestalled. That very morn
Their friends departed, thinking them all dead,
And fearing a like fate, their homeward course had sped.
Burke, Wills, and King, each wasted to the bone—
Exhausted, and in rags—their camels sick
Only one horse—Burke's "" Billy""—with them still
Now face their fate. And thus the Leader spake
To Wills and King : "" Can you our friends o'ertake,
Who for Menindie started with the dawn ?""
Both shake their heads--"" We cannot."" "" Nor can I—
To ask you 'twas my duty. Now must we,
Each with his load of food upon his back,
Gather'd from scraps left buried here, strive hard
To reach the Southern settlements."" The others
Counsel conciliation of the blacks,
Still on the Creek. o'ersway'd in this, they rise,
And for Mount Hopeless plod their anguish'd way.
Tow'rd Adelaide their thoughts still gravitate,
Till the last camel in a quagmire sinks
He dies, and he is eaten ; but fierce thirst
Assailing—their way lost—the Mount, a myth,—
They must retrace their steps to Cooper's Creek.
They reach it, feebler than before ; but soon
The last scraps left there, finish'd, once again
To find Mount Hopeless they move forth. They move,
As moves the dial's shade, these shades of mam :
No substance left—no food. And now the horse,
Drooping from thirst, with nose that scrapes the ground,
Sinks on his knees,—and, dying, he is killed,
And his dried flesh will aid them to return.
Alas ! poor horse ! thou did'st thy duty well ;
Drank'st of the stream from Carpentaria,
And, like to some who once in life were blest,
Saw Paradise, and yet died miserably.
Again they falter back upon the Creek,
Living, yet feeling death in every limb,
In every joint, nerve—almost in the heart.
They pitch a tent, and having got some fish
From native blacks who lurked about the place,
Prepare to cook it ; but the tent takes fire—
They are too feeble 'gainst both wind and flames,
And all their last few stores are soon consumed.
King soothes the hostile blacks, and thus obtains
The native seed, to pound between two stones ;
Its flour, like stone-dust, making ruthless bread.
Searching for seed, and grinding it for food
Extinguishes their final flickering strength,
And Wills lies down with a calm smile, to die,
Exhorting them to leave him there alone.
And seek the blacks for aid. The Leader's heart
Resists, but by young Wills at length o'erruled,
They leave him, placing near within his reach
Nardoo and water for the next eight days, .
When they'll return. Bidding farewell, none weep ;
And one shall find him there—in his heroic sleep.
Burke now, and King, creep slowly along the Creek.
The blacks are gone. There is no chance of life,
Unless they're found : but, like the desert crow,
Or the wild dog, once gone, 'tis rare for man
Of the white races to discover them
The two creep forward with bewilder'd brain,
Whence comes a dreadful hour of secret pangs—
A silent, mental struggle, which shall die ?
Or which die first. Nature soon closes this.
The Leader throws away his sickening swag—
Makes his last supper on a carrion bird,
Shot and prepared by King with tenderest care—
And thus his last will speaks. "" I shall but hold
A few hours more, good King. Take this—and this.--
If you survive, deliver them. Do not go,
Till I am quite dead : 'tis some consolation
To have a friend near. While I am dying, place
This weapon in my right hand—and then leave me,
Unburied, as I lie."" Through that dark night,
The Leader, slowly dying, held his peace.
What thoughts were his—memories—affections fond—
Sad visions of high fame, had he returned—
None but his Maker knew. But once he sigh'd—
At day-break speechless— and at sunrise dead
One ragged, starving man, drooping o'er that grand head.
THE WORLD PROGRESSES BY ITS MARTYR'D MEN
Let none deplore the means whereby it moves
To higher knowledge and to larger acts ;
But the great sorrow o'er these noble bones,
After their victory, springs from the thought—
How little foresight would have saved their lives !
Blame lies on more than one ; but no complaint
The Leader breathed ;—he knew his work was done,
And, reconciled to fate, desired to leave
His bones to whiten for his monument :
Having s0 long the frightful desert faced,
He would lie stark, and arm'd to face it still.
He met Death hand to hand, nor felt the sting—
A skeleton of man, bow'd to God's skeleton King!
Noble delirium of a faithful brain,
Which Homer, or grey Ossian might approve;
While Christians equally will recognise
A spirit steadfast—-true to the last pulse—
Pledg'd to the path of Duty. Nor less great
In passive heroism, lay young Wills,
Starving on unnutritious nardoo-bread,
And dying, as he wrote, with a brave smile,
"" In excellent spirits."" Oh, how strong was life
In him, while on the threshold of the grave;
Closing his journal with a pleasant phrase,
Then lying back to die in that lone hut,
With ghastly Solitude to close his eyes.
The black men find him there ; then, meeting King,
Lay down one finger—cover it with sand
A sign too well, and sadly understood.
For King had left him there with scarce a hope.
The solo survivor now two fingers lays
Upon the sand, and covers them. The tribe
Accompanying him to where the Leader lies
Arm'd, and unburied. Then, those savages,
So little differing from the beasts, we thought,
All wept—perhaps as they ne'er wept before—
And pitying King, took him to dwell with them.
Such is the tale : and with the blacks lived King,
Wasting to nought on their unwholesome fare,
Till rescued by the party sent on search ;
Who reverently gather up the bones—
All that remain—of the heroic dead,
And homeward bear—slow months of heavy funeral
tread.

ACADEMY.
No more, alas ! my friends appear,
No one shall cheer this solemn gloom ;
All fly from hence, and leave a wretch
To meet a sad untimely doom.
Where now are all my youthful friends,
With whom I joined the midnight roar,
They too are fled, too late, alas !
And I shall shortly be no more.
Wilt thou, deluder, also fly
A wretch by thy fond arts undone ?
Or wilt thou drop a pitying tear
On my sad bier, when I am gone ?
And, oh ! beware ! nor tempt again
With arts resistless, hapless youth ;
Allure them not from virtue's way,
Nor from the sacred paths of truth.
'Twas in that guileful gulph I plung'd.
Where sweets ineffable appear'd;
Enamour'd with whose fatal charms.
In pleasure's course I onward steer'd;
Till fate's immutable decree
Brought ignominy's cruel name,
With all its vile attendants dire,
And blackest infamy and shame.
With horror now those scenes I view
That bore my captive mind away,
When revel sports and boist'rous mirth
Seduc'd me from the truth to stray.
Alas ! dear uncle ! poignant thought;
Lo, he appears not to upbraid;
His peaceful shade smiles on the wretch
Who impiously his blood hath shed.
Shrill knolls the bell, the rabble gaze,
Nor feel for one unfit for heav'n ;—
Yet, in repentance is my hope,
That crimes like mine may be forgiv'n.

On Friday the 30th ult. the half-yearly exhibition
of the various exercises by Doctor Halloran's pupils,
took place at his house in Phillip-street, and the La-
tin class underwent a public examination in their
classical studies. To those who are apprised of Doc-
tor Halloran's long experience as a teacher, and of
the number of persons now filling eminent situations
who were educated by him, it will scarcely be neces-
sary to say, that his pupils' acquirements, in the short
period during which they have studied under his di-
rections, appeared highly creditable to themselves
and to their instructor. Handsome silver medals, of
considerable value, were presented to Masters Henry
Robinson and John Wild, with the following short
but apposite address :—
"" Masters Henry Robinson and John Wild,
"" I have much pleasure in presenting to each of
you this honorary mark of distinction, in testimony
of my approbation of your endeavours to improve in
your various studies. Your success on this occasion,
far from relaxing those endeavours, I confide will prove
an animating incentive to increased exertion on your
part; and will excite also a spirit of laudable emula-
tion in the breasts of your fellow students.— I congra-
tulate each of you on your present acquisition ; and
would entreat you to remember, and attend to, these
words of an elegant Latin poet (to whose acquaintance
I hope ere long to introduce you), ' Macte nova vir-
tute, Puer.'""
Similar medals were obtained at Christmas last by
Masters Simeon Lord and Robert Campbell.
It must be highly gratifying to all who are aware of
the vital importance of education to the interests of
society, to know, not only that such an establishment
as Dr. Halloran's is open to the youth of this Colony,
but also that it receives the fostering attention and
patronage of those, under whose auspices, it may
fairly be hoped, the benefits which it offers will be
more extensively communicated.
From a recently received English paper we copy the
following Account of the Foundation of the Great
Stone of the Sheerness Docks :—
"" The first stone of the stupendous dry docks erect-
ing at Sheerness dock-yard was yesterday laid by Com-
missioner the Honorable Courtenay Boyle, amidst an
assembled multitude of workmen, masons, labourers,
pile-drivers, convicts, and others. I happened to be
present, and such things, you know, only sometimes
happen even to a sentimental traveller.
"" The extent of this prodigious and praiseworthy un-
dertaking seems to be little known to the public; and
well might the Secretary of the Admiralty, upon a re-
cent occasion in the House of Commons, invite the
gentlemen questioning the utility of these works to a
personal inspection : it is indeed from a personal in-
spection alone, that the extent, utility, durability, and
magnificence of the undertaking can be properly ap-
preciated. The first stone was laid with all the cere-
mony usual upon such occasions : some of the various
coins at present in circulation, with a parchment label
denoting the date, &c. were enclosed in a bottle, and
first lodged under the great stone, which itself was of
prodigious weight, and is 3 feet high on its edge on the
ground ; so that, independent of the vast foundation,
the three docks (each capable of receiving a first-rate)
are to be surrounded by 3 feet in thickness of massy
granite. Besides the Honorable Courtenay Boyle, the
Commissioner of the dock-yard, there were present to
witness the ceremony, the Right Honorable the Earl of
Cork (the Commissioner's brother), Colonel Prowse,
Colonel Daubency, of the 31st and 84th regiments,
Captain Brown, and all the officers of the Royal En-
gineers, &c.
""The Royal standard was hoisted, the stone sus-
pended with proper tackle, and 3 times 3 of hearty
cheering proclaimed the lodgment of what no mortal
eye now in existence will, in all human probability, ever
see removed.
"" The worthy Commissioner expressed his satisfac-
tion at the conduct of all concerned in this great work,
and hoped that Mr. Thomas, the resident engineer and
superintendent, might live to witness the completion of
his labour, and enjoy the fair fame attached to his me-
ritorious exertions. The Commissioner, in alluding to
the officers under his immediate direction, was addressed
by one of them in something like the following terms,
which, as if furnishes a kind of history or view of the
works and proved rather interesting at the time, I, like
a true traveller, committed to paper upon my return to
the inn, and now forward for your amusement and in-
formation :— Sir, said the officer alluded to, it is quite
impossible for the persons surrounding you who have
witnessed the ceremony of laying the first stone of this
stupendous undertaking, not to be impressed with
mingled emotions of pride, wonder, admiration, and
gratitude — pride at the country's capability to prose
cute such a work ; wonder and admiration at the art
and labour of man which has brought it thus forward ;
and gratitude to the Giver of all good, who has so
wonderfully aided man's efforts by rendering the sea
subservient to the barriers erected for its exclusion. If,
Sir, we look around us, in every direction we behold
matter for praise and wonder: here we see a wall 2000
feet in length, projected into the bosom of the sea;
there we view the stupendous sides of a magnificent
basin, superb arches of stone, capacious tunnels, im-
mense pillars of granite rearing their heads all around
us; in another place we behold mounds and mountains
of mud, moving with facility as it were by magic, under
the influence of railways, steam engines, horse runs,
and barrows. If we consider what this place was, con-
trasted with what it even now is, and contemplate what
it will be, we are indeed lost in admiration, and equally
unable, with the philosopher of old, to reflect on the
first stroke of a pickaxe, as it relates to the final forma-
tion of a pyramid, without the most pleasing emotions ;
or can we view this stone without considering that on it
may rest the prow of many a first-rate ship, which from
the facilities afforded by these great works when com-
pleted, may in a few days be sent from these docks to
bear the British thunder to the shore of any future
proud or insulting foe (loud cheering). Here, on this
very spot where we now stand, but a few months since
oozed the soft mud of Sheppey, unequal to the burthen
of man ; and we now tread it, a firm and solid founda-
tion: and if we think how this foundation has been
formed — first, by importing whole forests from Ox-
fordshire, Berkshire, and the surrounding counties,
transposing their once towering tops to the depth of 40
feet below the surface of the earth; next covering
their upset ends with fields of brick from Essex, and
binders of timber from Russia ; surmounting the whole
with quarries of granite from Scotland, Cornwall, and
Yorkshire — we must consider the ponderous prospect
before us with astonishment. No man reviewing these
works could question their utility, or cavil at their ex-
pence. That they are needful, will be advantageous,
and no prodigal expenditure permitted, is the highest
gratification to every man of integrity, and true lover of
his country ; these works, the greatest now in Europe,
will pass to posterity with due applause the names of
their projector, planner, executor, purveyor, and super-
intendent of the latter, Mr. Thomas : indeed, it might
appear fulsome to speak upon the present occasion and
in his presence; yet to lose such an occasion would be
the height of ingratitude : it is sufficient to say, that
the integrity which guides, the urbanity that governs,
and the kindness that upon all occasions distinguishes
the conduct of the honorable and amiable superinten-
dant of these great works, merits and meets support
from principle ; to follow his example is to do our duty
to our country ; and to obey his commands, the plea-
sure and the pride of all around him.
"" As an humble individual connected with these
works, aware of their durability to the utmost extent
that human labour, exertion, ingenuity, and skill can
devise or accomplish, I can only express my best hope,
and feel pursuaded I shall be joined by my surrounding
friends, that this happy country may last in honor, and
rise in glory, as long as the dock at Sheerness can float
a ship, or Old England furnish such heroes by land and
sea as have hitherto, and ever will defend us."" (Loud
cheering and applause from all present).
CRIMEA.— A new sect of Christians, deviating from
the Greek church, has sprung up in the south-eastern
parts of the Russian empire, and a curious rescript
has been issued by the Emperor Alexander, contain-
ing directions for its treatment. We know nothing of
the tenets of these Christians, except that it is intima-
ted that they resemble the Pauliciens of the 8th centu-
ry, of whom an account may be found in Gibbon.—
We may infer, therefore, that they approach to the
Protestant churches now established in Europe. The
course prescribed by the Emperor Alexander, touch-
ing these sectaries, though more humane, Certainly
reminds us of Trajan's celebrated letter to Pliny. The
similarity has also struck the continental editors, who
refer to the passage, which we here subjoin :—
"" They are not to be sought for ; but if they are
denounced and convicted, they are to be punished :—
yet so, that whoever shall deny himself to be a Chris-
tian, and shall have given proof of it by worshipping
our Gods, though he may have been suspected in time
past, shall obtain pardon from his repentance.""
The Russian converts to the new faith are said to
have been already driven from their homes, and placed
in an insulated situation, in order to prevent prosely-
tism. They are called Duchoboozi ; and the rescript,
which is addressed to the Military Governor of Cher-
son, is to the following effect :—
"" The sect having been removed from the Ukraine
to the circle of Melitsholks, in the Tauris, in conse-
quence of the blameable way of life imputed to them,
and to prevent their opinions from spreading, the Go-
vernor is directed to consider the motives of this remo-
val, which is said view at once to protect the sect from
improper mortifications, and to stop the spreading of
their opinions ; and the Government, not having re-
ceived for many years any complaints from one side or
the other, or other reports of disorders, had every
reason to suppose that the measures adopted were
sufficient.
"" The departure of this sect from the true faith of
the Greco-Russian church is stated to be a deviation
founded on some erroneous representations of the true
worship, and of the spirit of Christianity ; but as they
are not without religion — for they seek for what is di-
vine, though not with a right understanding — it does
not become a Christian Government to employ harsh
and cruel means, torture, exile, &c. to bring back to
the bosom of the church those who have gone astray.
The doctrine of the Redeemer, who came into the
world to save the sinner, cannot, it is said, be spread
by constraint and punishment ; cannot serve for the
oppression of those who are to be led back into the
paths of truth. All the measures of severity ex-
hausted upon the Duchoboosi in the course of 30 years,
have not been able to extirpate this sect, and have
only increased the number of its adherents. They
are, therefore, in future to be protected from unme-
rited insults on account of the difference of their faith.
By being removed to another settlement they would
be again placed in a hard situation, and be punished
on a mere complaint, without examination.
"" The colony is therefore recommended to the spe-
cial superintendence and particular care of the Gover-
nor, who, without regarding false allegations or pre-
conceived opinions, is to examine into all the local
circumstances, their way of life, their conduct, and
take care of them, as an impartial Governor who stu-
dies the good of those who are confided to his care.—
The fate of these settlers must be permanently se-
cured ; they must feel that they are under the protec-
tion of the laws: and then, but not before, His Im-
perial Majesty says, we may expect from them attach-
ment and love to the Magistrates.— But it is added, if
these sectaries seek to draw away others from the Es-
tablished church, and to injure them with their own
religious notions, then the energy of the law must be
exerted against such violators of it, and such illegal
conduct must be checked. But even then it is not al-
lowable, that, on account of one or more criminals
who are convicted of a violation of the law, the whole
colony, which has had no share in it, should be made
responsible. Such complaints and accusations require
a careful examination, from whom the complaint
comes, and what may be the motives of it. Thus the
two Duchoboozi named in your representation, who
after their return to the true church, accused this so-
ciety of various transgressions, and deposed to their
blameable way of life, may have done this out of ma-
lice or revenge; perhaps they were excluded from the
society for crimes, or deserted from a contentious and
inimical spirit. Such mere complaints, which de-
serve altogether no attention, must never induce the
adoption of severe measures, which may he followed
by the arrest, imprisonment and torture of those who
are not yet convicted of any bad intention, or any
crime.""— Calcutta Journal.
LATITUDE OF TREES IN SWEDEN:— From researches
made in Sweden on the different kinds of wood indi-
genous to the country, it has been ascertained that the
birch reaches the farthest north, growing beyond the
70th degree; the pine reaches to the 69th; the fir
tree to the 68th ; the osir, willow, aspien, and quince,
to the 66th ; the cherry and apple tree to the 62d ;

God gave him gifts ; nor gave in vain
The great heart and the master-brain
To dream, to bátele, to attain.
To storm the height.
The power that all men strive to gain
Was his by right.
O saddest Spring in all the land I
O mystery, hard to understand
When, at the stern unknown command,
With Icy breath,
Fate placed within his fearless hand
The gift of Death !
Calm be his sleep who lived to dare.
Go, say a patriot slumbers there
Whose brows were never bent to wear
His loftiest fame,
Yet wrote on Queensland's page a rare-«
A fadeless name !
He fought his fight ; he won bis goal.
His life is on the battle-scroll ;
And, whilst beyond your weak control.
The tears ye shed
Well deep within a Nation's soul,
He is not dead.

My soul to-day
Is far swan
Sailing the VeauvianBay;
My winged boat,
A bird afloat,
Swims round the purple peaks remote:
Bound purple peaks
It sails, and seeks
.Blue inlets and their crystal creeks,
Where high rocks throw,
Through deeps below,
A duplicated golden glow.
Far, vague and dim
The mountains swim;
'While on Vesuvius' misty brim.
With outstretched bands,
The gray smoke stands,
O'erlooklng the volcanio lands,
Here Isolds smiles
O'er liquid miles ;
And yonder, bluest of tho leles.
Calm Capri waits,
Her sapphire gates
.Beguiling to her bright estates.
I heed not, if
My rippling skift
Float 6wlit or slow irom cliff to cliff-.
With dreamful eyes
My spirit lies
Under the walls of Paradise.
Under tho walls
Where swells and falls
Tbe boy's deep breast at intervals,
At peace I lie
Blown softly by,
A cloud upon this liquid Bky.
This day, so mild,
Is Heaven's own obild,
With earth and ocean reconciled :
The airs I feel
Around me steal
Are murmuring to the murmuring keel.
With dreamful eyes
My spirit lies
Where summer sings and never dies
O'erailed with vines,
She glows and shines,
Among her luture oil and vines.

Where trafilo blows,

Beneath the surging wave
There lie the young and brave.
God rest their souls-and save I
One of no common mould,
Like valiant knight of old,
Harris-the stanch and bold.
A starving band to save,
He dived beneath the wave.
And found at length-a grave !
For such brave daring done,
Let the bright setting sun
glance o'er a trophy won.
Hoist, hoist the flag on high I
Let the death-signal fly. -'

And the red beacon's glarer
A sad momento bear

But ah ! how oft hast thou deceived me, Hope !
unstable as thou art, a feeble prop ;
Here if I keep my room, it nought avails,
A sullen death-like silence round prevails;
if out I stroll the least frequented road,
My ears are shocked with blasphemy to God.
E'en from that sex ( the loveliest of our race),
When as they ought, man's first,man's last solace ;
But when, alas ! we see them truth deride,
Reckless of consumely, reproach, just pride,
Callous to feeling, unabash'd by shame,
Devoid of aught that hath a virtuous name ;
Shock'd must the man of feeling be to think,
And mark his fellow creatures in the brink
Of retributive justice, endless woe,
On those who spurn what GOD will aye bestow,
If ask'd with penitence and broken heart,
Contrite, and humble, unadorn'd by art.
Unthinking mortal-, have ye one forgot
What but for mercy might have been thy lot
Mercy, the GOD LIKE attribute of KINGS,
Surpassing all terrestrial other things:
Mercy, well meant, to save the foul alive,
If but to curb those vices ye would strive;
Think not with GOD to wrestle,'tis too late :--
Hence with that demon, blind, unering Fate,
Think on the sacrifice thy GOD hath made.
On him the fins of contrite hearts are laid.
'Twas not for partial man that JESUS came,
Sinners, or rich, or poor, with GOD's the same :
'Twas not to call the righteous, we are told,
But the repentant sinner, young and old.
Turn then, ye thoughtless ill advised race,
Thy God the Eternal is a god of Grace.
But jark ! the clock strikes nine, my heart beats high,
imagination paints a parent by,
""E'en now, e'en very now,"" methinks I sue
A reverend mother on her bended knee,
Emploring blessings on a licless son,
That o'er his head revolving years may run;
That he may yet his former peace regain,
And leave this world, free from all worldly pain.
Bless her, ye Powers ! from every evil save ---
Bless her, oh ! doubly bless her. GOD I crace !
Such is my wish, and such I trust will be
My last fond prayer, then to be joined to thee,
Thee, and another who was dear to me.",The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser ,"837,295,1131,1199,1197,955,202,539,1141,940,939,1024,921,1080,1210,1217,1187,1192,1114,844,958,980,928,1204,1060,1200,991,1034,1211,1205,1211,1022,797,1211,1008,946,955,1084,1023,888,981,968,1057,1076,999,1000,1036,1145,1036,934,978,938,1198,740,1057,934,854,1032,970,1151,1025,1078,1190,1200,1199",Sun 25 Sep 1808,"302,377,420,478,531,603,664,718,773,838,896,950,1016,1066,1133,1183,1240,1299,1358,1430,1485,1543,1603,1655,1719,1770,1836,1896,1954,2017,2073,2130,2194,2241,2307,2364,2423,2472,2535,2600,2654,2714,2769,2827,2887,2944,3008,3062,3118,3179,3239,3298,3346,3421,3466,3532,3593,3656,3704,3755,3824,3872,3934,3994,4041","1826,1762,1704,1642,1643,1648,2179,2128,1700,1772,1649,1648,1648,1642,1648,1643,1647,1646,1646,1647,1647,1648,1645,1642,1645,1643,1647,1648,1643,1648,1642,1647,1642,1644,1645,1643,1642,1641,1640,1640,1648,1647,1641,1647,1639,1641,1632,1642,1634,1636,1634,1635,1645,1642,1645,1652,1649,1644,1644,1650,1648,1652,1648,1646,1641",627591,Page 2

SIR,
Having once had the pleasure of an intimate
acquaintance with a person of some eminence in
the literary world, I the day before yesterday laid
my hand by accident upon the rough copy of a
few verses in his own hand writing, descriptive of
p rt of the sufferings of an unfortunate Debtor, the
actual poverty of whose circumstances placed him
beyond the hope of evermore emerging from the
vale of wretchedness, unless charity should inter-
pose its aid, of which, however, the complainant
appears not to be very lavish in his expectation.
To introduce any opinion on the subject of
Debtor and Creditor, I neither design nor wish,
nor do I intend to offer any strictures upon the lit-
tlee extempore piece itself further than that the sub-
ject suits unfortunately with every time and every
country; and that I am seriously of opinion, that
if many Creditors were sensible of the sufferings
endured by the generality of imprisoned Debtors,
we should often feel gratified in the contemplation
of acts of generosity. I have in my time known
a Creditor to pay weekly alimony to a man im-
prisoned fora trifling sum, and to keep the priso-
ner locked up until his groats exceeded considera-
bly the sum itself, although he was certain all the
while that the unfortunate man had nothing but
his groats to live upon, and the very menus adopted
for enforcing payment, were far more certain to re-
move the possibility of compliance. The motive
for imprisoning a man under such circumstances I
could not help questioning upon several considera-
tions; the first, whether the Plaintiff could enter-
tain a hope of benefitting by his confinement ; and
this I knew to be impossible, for the poor fellow
was friendless and forlorn ; and, unable to answer
some trivial demands incidental to a first introduc-
tion into these mansions of distress, had been
obliged to dispose of part of his apparel to answer
the exigency. The consideration that came next
under view was, the inducement to pay a certain
weekly allowance under a certainty that
no part of it could be ever re-imburscd ;
and the inference that naturally followed was
either that the plaintiff had more money than he
knew what to do with; and might certainly have
applied any superabundance to a more charitable
purpose ; or, that he was a profound simpleton
to send out his money upon so unprofitable an er-
rand ; or, but surely no man could be so unfeeling
--a fixed resentment had taken root against a
poor miserable fellow to whom he had given a
certain small credit which had not been satisfied ;
and that personal vengeance was, in truth the
end proposed. To delight in spinning out the
miseries of a fellow creature, and to derive
gratification from the protraction of his suffer-
ings, is not, as I consider, doing as a man would
wish to be done by, and consequently is a breach
of the Divine Law, an offence to our blessed
Religion ; and, if considered also in a moral or
an immoral point of view, little further observation
need be offered than that it is too prominent a fea-
ture of turpitude to admit of avowal :--but I beg
pardon for the unintended length of my introduc-
tion, and now leave you to the little Extempore
itself.
The Poor Debtor.
By fortune discarded--a prison my doom,
Ah ! why do I sadly survive,
But to end an existence, mayhap in this tomb
That's prepared for the wretch while alive.
If a brother in durance hail freedom's return,
To transport my heart doth incline ;
But transient's the joy-with impatience I burn,
And I wish the same blessing were mine.
Now hope grows too feeble my spirits,to chear ;
Reflection consoles me no more,
For thought but informs me my lot is severe
That I live but new ills to endure.
From whom shall the debtor immur'd beg relief:
Or who his misfortunes befriend,
When the wants of his children but add to his grief,
And their tears they unheeded expend ?
Ye generous few, who can kindly bestow
A mite on the suffering poor,
Compassionate this my sad story of woe,
And to Liberty open the door.
Or if by mishap be unheeded my pray'r,
And I sink beneath usage unkind,
The grave puts an end to all miseries here
And in death a true friend shall I find.

When Sol has commenc'd his diurnal career,
And the bright spangled dew drops from buds
disappear,
With my dog and my gun to the forest I fly,
Where in stately confusion rich gums sweep the sky.

Brisk Lurcher, obedient, flies off to command:---

Secure for a moment---yet shouts rend her ears,
And the brush fired round her, again she appears.
Delighted the Victim once more to behold,
Away scampers Lurcher---and gets a firm hold.
In vain has she doubled, since now she must
yield:
A stream from her haunches empurples the field:

THE EMIGRANT'S VISION.
As our Bark dashed away o'er the night-shrouded Deep,
And out tow'rds the South I was gazing,
O'er my soul first there gathered a dimness like sleep,
Then the light of a Vision amazing
As rises the Moon, from the white waves afar
Came a Goddess it seemed, of love wisdom and war,
And on her bright helmet, encircling a star,
Behold there was graven-AUSTRALIA.
Her robes were as green is the mantle of Spring,
Newly spread by the streams that so mildly
Elapse through yon flock-legioned plains, or that sing
'Mid those blue-ranging mountains so wildly,
Her looks were as bright as the lustre that lies
At morn on the seas of the South, and her eyes
Were as deep in their joy as the clear sunny skies
The clear sunny skies of AUSTRALIA.
O Stranger, she asked, hast thou fled from the Home
Which thy Forefathprs bled for so vainly ?
Does shame for its Past thus disgust thee to roam,
Or despair of its Future constrain thee?
In the far sunny South there's a refuge from wrong,
Where the Shiloh of Freedom, expected so long,
To Genius already as shouting his song!-
Tis the evergreen Land of AUSTRALIA.
There Truth her abode on the forest-clad hills
Shall establish, a dweller forever;
And Plenty rejoice by the thence-flowing rills,
Aye wedded to honest Endeavour :
Till the Future a numberless People shall see
All equally noble as equally free!
And the God they adore their sole Monarch shall be !
Then come;-build thy Home in AUSTRALIA.
This said, tow'rds the South she passed brightly away,
And at once as from slumber I started;-
But the cadences sweet of its welcoming lay
Yet breath'd of the Vision departed:
And whene'er the Deep these had fadingly spread,
The swell of my heart, as it throbbed to my head,
Seemed to break into words on my tongue-and I said
Be the Home of my hope then-AUSTRALIA.
A LESSON FROM NATURE
O 'tis a happy thing with thee,
My Sister, thus alone to be
Upon a Summer eve,
Where naught of the World's misery
May give the eye to grieve;
For, baring here her glad green breast
To all the rapture of the West,
The Earth by her example so
Would teach us meetly to receive,
As hand in hand we go,
The heaven-descending dove
Of universal Beauty and universal Love.
That there should be one soul unblest,
Or such a thing as hate-born grief,
From the gloaming East to the golden West,
Almost exceeds my heart's belief,

My Sister, it looks forth to see,
So blissfully glowing into intense relief,

THE LOSSES OF THE PAST.
The World is emptied of the living gladness
That dwelling round my Childhood, came o'er it
In every many-murmurous fit
Of the mere wind !-and ever in my sadness,
I look out over its unfriendly face
In vain now for some special Place,
Which should to Memory seem the habitation
Of that white light of Love wherewith afar
My soul rayed, like the Evening Star
Passioning earthward from its heavenly station,-
Rayed tow'rds all Beauty, through the boundless joy
Of the then happy, happy Boy.
'Tis gone too-the frank Trust is gone forever,
Wherewith I afterwards essayed the World,
And first the battle-flag unfurled
Of my own individual endeavour !
Youth's unworn bravery I strive in vain
To gather back and wear again :
To flush me for a moment with the Feeling
That ran then from my heart, as some glad rill
Leaps singing down its native hill !
But ah ! instead, one sense of Loss comes pealing
Out of the sunless Past-comes like a wail
Heard lengthening up the midnight gale.
One sense of vain intents, and hopes yet vainer,
And rich affections wasted upon such
As did not-could not prize them much !
He only of young Life can be a gainer,
Who carries with him its unperished bloom
Into an early builded Tomb.
And yet, though turning with this sick conclusion,
My weary soul, methinks, derives some gain
Of moral strength even from the pain

BY T--------.
How sweet and pleasant is the crystal stream,
Which murmurs thro' the bosom of the vale;
Just as gray light of morn begins to beam,
How sweet the soft and gentle Zephyr gale;
Which with a grateful odour seems to teem;
How sweet when nature seems to glow and smile:
And all around appears with blooming pride,
And with her charms our deepest griefs subside.
How sweet to watch the calm unruffled sea,
From the retreat of an embowering shade;
Where no human eye can penetrate or see,
(That sweet retreat for sweetest pleasures made,)
Where birds melodious chant their wonted lay,
Where howling storms are all in silence laid;
And the bright sun shines on the briny wave,
And wild temptests round have ceas'd to rave.
But sweeter far the charms of one dear maid,
Whom Angels will for ever guard and love;
Whose sweet lips whisper thro' the deep'ning shade,
Such bliss this world alone can never give;
Bliss which no earthly thing can ever fade,
Nor found in India's wealth, nor balmy grove;
Bliss which soon dissipates each jarring strife,
And gilds sweet friendship thro' the gloom of life.

'Ono moment let me linger on the strand,
To sketch thy character with faithful hand,
Behold a man, endued with clearest view,
Of judgmont solid, of ideas true,
To justice prone, and honour's sacred plan ;
A candid, unassuming, worthy man !
That genuine charity invests his heart,
That, unprofessmg, can relief impart ;
And then, unostentatiously, retire
From the just gratitude his deeds inspire:
Such are the virtues which coment the tie
Of man to man, and bind society.
But, lo ! in ether light our Walker stands-
To him our Isle is bound by other bands :
' Our infant commerce sees him with regret,
A first-class star from her Empyrean set,
While tho late partner of his house remains
Th' ascendant planet of her azure plains.
'Farewell ! Farewell ! Australia (well I know)
Accordsyou happiness where'er you go,
And to the general vote be added mine,
Last, though not least, with hay sincere to join :
May gales propitious waft theo e'er the deep,
Soft roll the billows, and the tempests sleep ;
'Some gentle Nereid meanwhile floating thee
' O'er the sea-track of blest security !
And, when thougain'st at length thy Albion, a shore,
May the same peace attend that wing'd the o'or,
And over be thy handmaid, till she glows,
Lighting the pillow of thy last repose !
May her sweet influence on thy offspring shino,
And her white plumes encircle all of thine!

THE MARINER'S CHILD TO HIS MOTHER
( From Roscoe's Juvenile Keepsake.)
Oh, weep no more, sweet mother,
Oh, weep no more to-night ;
And only watch the sea, mother,
Beneath the morning light.
Then the bright blue sky is joyful,
And the bright blue sky is clear,
And I can see, sweet mother,
To kiss away your tear.
But now the wind goes wailing
O'er the dark and trackless deep,
And I know your grief, sweet mother,
Though I only hear you weep.
My father's ship will come, mother,
In safety o'er the main ;
When the grapes are dyed with purple
He will be back again.
The vines were but in blossom
When he bade me watch them grow ;
And now the large leaves, mother,
Conceal their crimson glow.
He'll bring us shells and sea-weed,
And birds of shining wing ;
But what are these, dear mother ?
It is himself he'll bring.
Our beautiful Madonna
Will mark how you have wept,
The prayers of early morning,
The vigils you have kept.
She will guide his stately vessel,
Though the sea be dark and drear ;
Another week of sunshine,
My father will be here.
I'll watch with thee, sweet mother,
But the stars fade from my sight ;
Come, come and sleap, sweet mother,
Oh, weep no more to-night.",The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser ,"381,860,574,536,466,523,450,585,539,478,384,507,517,614,504,582,399,631,372,513,611,556,449,567,475,559,414,401,500,499,423,525,589,455,373,593,564,596,443",Sat 5 Jun 1830,"2469,2561,2619,2697,2735,2773,2811,2860,2902,2939,2978,3025,3062,3100,3138,3188,3229,3268,3303,3355,3394,3434,3473,3525,3563,3600,3638,3689,3727,3765,3801,3854,3892,3930,3968,4022,4061,4100,4137","539,298,442,390,387,388,375,368,386,385,384,384,385,384,376,384,369,382,370,367,379,383,382,382,369,367,363,359,380,371,369,380,357,359,378,359,368,377,377",2195258,Page 4

Collect for the 4th Sunday after Trinity.
O God of pow'r and might supreme,
Who dost securely shield all those
That in thy love their trust repose,
Without whom strength is but a dream,
Without whom what we holy deem
Is but some creature canonis'd
But earthly still ; may the pure beam
Of thy transcendant mercy, pris'd
Above all worlds, on us increase
And multiply its lustrous ray '
The earnest of an endless day,
That, thou our rule and guide thro' these
Things temporal, tho' sorely lost
In this our voyage of grief and pain, ,
Eternal things may not be lost,
But thee and heav'n we may attain.
"" O hear us holy Father, make
These pray'ers avail for Jesu's sake.--AMEN.
Collect 7th Sunday after Trinity
O Lord, whose power and might extends o'er all
Created beings, we thy creatures call
On thee, who art the giver of all good,
And author, while this spacious world hath stood;
Engraft within our hearts to love thy name '
Increase among us true religion's flame ;
Nourish thy servants with all goodness, Lord,
And of thy mercy needful help afford
To keep us in the same, for Jesu's sake,,
The anointed one, on us compassion take. AMEN.

_
The old road north of Wiseman's
Climbs up by cliff and ledge,
On great, grey, lichened buttresses,
Above the river's edge;
For faithfully they packed the stone,
In Solomon his day,
And wearily the builders wrought,
Who never drew their pay.
To right the roofs of Windsor
Are glinting in the sun,
The mist is on the crossing place,
The day is now begun—
A long, long day of liberty,
With sun and road and sky--
Ah, pity their captivity,
Who toiled in days gone by!
The yellow of the cornland,
The cliff's enpurpled state,
The old stone house, where Wiseman dwelt,
With gryphon-guarded gate—
I wonder here what viewless ghosts
Tramp through the heat of noon,
If down the road the clank of chains
Is heard beneath the moon ?
Or if the ferry cable
Creaks ghostly in the night,
To bear across the phantom gang
That may not bide the light ?
Light hearts to whom this happy land
Is free and blessed abode,
Pass on your way, but, passing, bless
The makers of the road!

THE aulk kirk bell was blythely ringing
On Sabbath's silent morn;
The laverock her sang was singing,
Up frae amang the corn ;
Her upward flight still higher winging,
On fluttering pinions borne.
The sonsie bairnies a' were puin',
Upon the whinny braes ;
The wild blue-bell, and thyme and gowan,
- Or gathering die slues,
Or down the grassy knowes were rowin',
Fyling their Sunday clues.
No sound upon the stillness breaking,
Save from the woodland bower,
The blackbird's song the echoes waking,
Its melody to pour ;
The honey bee its sweets was seeking
* In every fragrant flower.
In the kirk-yard the auld were reading,
With reverence and cure ;
Around them pluy'd the young unheeding,
The dead thut rested there
Mouy tombs, that told how time was speeding
To auld, und young, und fair.
The dogs, that every day were fighting,
Lay still ut ilku door ;
'' The villuge ruudy ceusetl her fiyting,
And gued, with look» demure,
To the auld kirk to nurse her spite iu;
To serve for MX days more. .
The hammer rested in the smiddy,
The happer at the null,
The weary cuttle sought the meadow,
To eat one day their fill ;
The druukard aiuce a week was steady,
But wantiug suir his gill.
Perfumes, fioni many a flower were blending,
In the warm summer air;
And songs of hirds io Heaven uscending,
The hymn of nature there ;
And roan, before his JMaker bending,
Lifted his soul in prayer.

My thoughts are free like winds from distant
oceans,
No man, no bars can hold my spirit hero;
Some days it travels far to sunny islands
Or stays and dreams in cool, green forests
near.
When dark grey clouds are dimming all my
sunshine,
And everything seems sad and dark and lone,
My thoughts awake and then I seem to wander
To spaces where sad thoughts, are never
known.
I wander by a tiny woodland river,
Surrounded by tall dark green trees of pine.
The sun is warm, and wildflowers blossom
gaily,
The ferns, the scents, the joyous birds are
mine.

I knew a little sparrow,
And I fed him on soap;
Of course he didn't like It,
But I had a hope,
That It wouldfconie through his feathers,
And make them bright and clean;
For he was the dirtiest sparrow
That I have ever seen.
1 know a little puppy.
And I fed him on meat;
1 had a kind of notion.
Thal that would make him sweet;
But it only made him savage,
And when he sat up to beg,

He bit my trouser leg.

And I fed her on jam;

When out In her pram;

All around the place,
With Jam on her pinnnfore,
And over all her face.

Write not my name on honour rous

To crumble with man's memory

Wear no dark clothes, speak in no

Seeking rare virtues which did not

Just let me lie, under the cool, sweet

And sleep in peace, where I will not

I ask one thing; that, in still far-off
days,
Someone who knew me, should in their
dally round
Suddenly pause, caught by some sight
or sound,
Some glance, some phrase, some trick
of memory's ways
Which brings me to their mind; then
I shall wait
Eager with hope; to hear them say:
""How great

All that I ask for; just: ""He was my

So still was all the sky, the air so clear,
That when I reached the gully-track and heard
Far off, far down, the lone note of a bird,
I felt a chill small presence drawing near,
And knew a momentary pause of fear.
So calm was the cool bush no least leaf whirred
To the cold creek, and not one wild thing stirred.
The bird's faint note died in my listening ear,
Puzzled, I went my way in reverie,
Seeking that haunting presence till my heart
Suddenly knew summer's last task was done,
And on the hills, her blue robes trailing free,
Brown Autumn wandered pensively apart,
Lighting the banksia candles one by one.

Recent advices from Paris tell of an almost incredible departure from the
vogue for simplicity in women's shoes. At fashion parades mannequin's hobble in
shoes like clogs with soles 3in thick and heels nearly 6in high.
IN regard to extremities woman is
extreme.
And given to phantasies found in a
dream.
First her head and her finger-nails
seemed to compete
In extravagant fashions; and now
it's her feet.
From her head to her toes
This freak fussiness goes;
Tho' why she should have it so
nobody knows.
HER frontage she decorates till her
face beams
With unguents and paints and with
various creams
In purple or mauve; but that's
nought, be it said,
To the terrible things that she does
to her bead
With helmets and toques
To amaze honest blokes
Who are apt to regard them as
rather queer jokes.
THIS month her head-covering
towers to the sky;
Next month 'tis a postage stamp
cocked o'er one eye,
Or a basin down-turned that half-
blinds the poor dear,
Or a fragment of stuff that she
hangs on one ear,
Or her much-abused head
Is embellished instead
With mammoth affair like a
canopy spread.
NOW the freakishness suddenly flies
to her feet;
And soon she'll be walking the work-
aday street
A tottering giantess stumping
along
On heels that astonish the gaping
male throng.
All the bright village lads;
But sour husbands and dads
May be not so amused, since
they pay for her fads.

By ""Den""
In his recent Reichstag speech Herr Hitler is reported to have said that
China was not strong enough mentally to exist in a modern world.
I WAS here when the world was
young, as men count young.
Watched nation after nation rise
in pride,
Seen pearl on pearl of patting centuries
strung
Upon Time's abacus and pushed aside,
Heard thro' the ages many a conqueror
Thunder in arrogance upon my door,
Marked his pride pass as lotus petals
fold.
I should be here still when the world
grows old.
CALMLY I slept, awakened, slept again,
Counting the aeons as the day and
night,
Seen Egypt, Babylon, Greece, Rome and
Spain,
The Western peoples rise up in their
might.
Dreaming, I marked the clamour, heard
their boasts;
Tartar and Manchu, Genghis Khan's vast
hosts
Have clouded for an hour this placid
brow,
Raging against me; yet where are they
now?
GONE with the yellowed leaves of
yesteryear.
I, who have watched a world work out
its fate,
Heard all the tales of triumph, hate, and
fear,
Have learned the gift of patience; I
can wait.
Wait as I waited to see young lands plot
To rediscover arts I'd long forgot;
These who bowed down before bar-
barian kings
When my art, literature, wen ancient
things.
STORMED by an Eastern upstart whose
queer pride
Seeks to subdue and bend me to his
will,
Mocked by a Western tyrant who'd deride
My ancient wisdom; so I dream on
still.
Gadflies, exulting for one summer's day
Disturb my dreams; but these shall drift
away
With olden echoes sounding down the
past.

A newspaper correspondent complains that, while the modern young miss
is more or less decorative in an artificial way, her fund of intelligent conversation
and her vocabulary leave much to be desired.
I SAW them meet upon a crowded tram.
First, they stood beak to beak as
pigeons do;
Then gushing floods of speech burst
every dam:
""Dawling!"" ""Mai dawling! Is it
REALLY you?""
Their finger-nails were painted signal-red
Their lips bright mauve, their noses
white as starch,
A scrap of straw absurdly decked each
head.
Their brows were plucked down to a
slender arch.
""DAWLING!"" ""But, DAWLING !
Fency meeting HERE!
Of ALL the places in this fraightful
town!""
""Why, yes. It's ebsolutely THRILLING.

""It's AGES since I saw you ! DO sit

""But LISTEN, dawling (whisper) Hev
you heard?""
""Not GEORGE? Mai DEAR! How

ROUND one. They went to corners for
repair;
Repowdered noses and repainted lips.
Touched here and there their strangely
plastic hair
Deftly and cunningly with finger-tips.
Gazing in mirrors raptly as they toiled;
Then sat, both strangely vague and
listless eyed.
Until one more idea within them boiled.
And once again the flood-gates opened
wide:
""DAWLING!"" ""But, sweet, it's
mejic'ly DEVAIN

""But, sweetness, Ai em LIVING on this

MAKER of Earth and Sea,
What shall we render Thee?
All ours is Thine:—
All that our land doth hold,
Increase of field and fold,
Rich ores and virgin gold,
Thine—Thine—all Thine !
What can Thy children bring ?
What save the voice to sing
""All things are Thine !""
What to Thy throne convey ?
What save the voice to pray
""God bless our land alway,
This land of Thine ?""
Oh with Thy mighty hand
Guard Thou the Motherland ;
She, too, is Thine.
Lead her where honor lies,
We beneath other skies
Still clinging daughterwise,
Hers, yet all Thine.
Britons of ev'ry creed,
Teuton and Celt agreed,
Let us be Thine.
One in all noble fame,
Still be our path the same,
Onward in Freedom's name,
Upward in Thine! J. Brunton Stephens.
The prices now given for pictures are so
greatly in excess of the sums paid for paintings
half a century ago that a Teniers, sold in Paris
in 1822 for £32, recently brought over £800 ;
and a Wouvermans, sold in 1822 for £80, has
realised £2000.
A large party of Americans are preparing to
visit Iceland to unite with the Icelanders in
celebrating the 1000th anniversary of their
Republic. Boston has contributed a large parcel
of goods in aid of the celebration.
Plundering the Graves.—The Koran says
that when a man dies, they who survive him
ask what property he has left behind. The
angel who bends over the dying man asks what
good deeds he has sent before him. There is
another class, though happily but few in number,
who ascertain what decorations sorrowing friends
have placed over his grave. One of the latter
specimens of humanity, we are told, visited a
grave in a local cemetery, and stole therefrom a
tuft of flowers, which were growing over the
abode of the dead. Such occurrences are rare in
civilised communities, and the feelings of the
despicable thief who has thus plundered the
dead, on her dying bed, may be more easily
imagined than described.
Spanish Gipsies.—lt is impossible not to be
struck by the originality and cleverness of the
gipsies, even in their vices. A gipsy-man was at
confession one day, and whilst he was confessing,
he spied in the pocket of the monk's habit a silver
snuff-box, and stole it. ""Father,"" he said,
immediately, ""I accuse myself of having stolen
a silver snuff-box.""—""Then, my son, you must
certainly restore it."" ""Will you have it your-
self, my father ?""—""I ? Certainly not, my
son !"" ""The fact is,"" proceeded the gipsy, "" that
I have offered it to its owner, and he has refused
it""—""Then you can keep it with a good
conscience,"" answered the father.
""Human Nature,"" says Snyder, ""delights
in deceiving and being deceived ; in cheating and
being cheated. Some time ago a provincial
councillor, while the Council was in session,
came to me and said that the Parliamentary re-
porter on the staff of the paper on which I have
the honor to be engaged, had been the means of
bringing about a domestic quarrel, the end of
which was not yet. I asked him how that had
come to pass ? Well, he told me it came to pass
in this way. After attending the Council, and
joining fervently in the prayer read by the
Speaker, and responding to the petition it con-
tained with due solemnity, he and a few others
who had a horror of hearing a long-winded speech
from the member for Bunkumtown, and the
reply which would follow from the representative
of Fernland, agreed in the library that they
would adjourn to an hotel and make a night of
it. But it so turned out, things being uncom-
monly pleasant, that they not only made a night,
but they made a good part of the morning of it.
And each councillor, when he returned home,
excused his long absence to his wife on the
ground that they had been upending so many
long hours in the Council Chamber in fighting
for the grand principle of insisting that the Bible
should be read in schools. And the wives
lauded their husbands for their efforts in so good
a cause. They took pity on them, and before
they closed the bed curtains, bidding them
to take rest and recruit their exhausted ener-
gies, they prepared them a mixture of
hot and strong and sweet as a Holace. But
it came about that several of the wives,
interested in so moral a debate, read the discus-
sion in the newspaper, and the last paragraph
contained the following short announcement: —
""The Council then adjourned at a quarter past
10."" Then the better halves of the councillors
at once saw how they had been treacherously
deceived, and much that was very unpleasant
followed. ""Now, Mr. Snyder,"" said my friend,
""if you can only induce your reporter and the
reporters of the other journals to omit all men-
tion of the hour the Council adjourns, you will
be assisting conjugal freedom of action ; you
will be a silent advocate of the liberty of the
subject in man with regard to his married state;
and you will confer peace upon many a house
hold. 'Where ignoronce is bliss, 'tis folly to be

You rang the board at Brolga, a year ago this
shearing
(The station topped the market with its fourteen
pence a pound),
And when I saw you khaki-clad, amid a burst of
cheering,
I thought you were the finest mate a chap lad
ever found.
You broke the chestnut Parker sold, because he
couldn't ride
On such a vicious beast, he said, and let you
have him cheap.
I watched you through the sliprails with a heart
that swelled,with pride
Until you brought the outlaw back, as quiet as a
sheep.
You danced all night on Christmas Eve-the girls
would have their way.
You danced-a bit more than I liked-with my
own sweetheart, Kate ;
But I forgave you when you left, that January
day,
Bound for the Cape, and leaving me behind to
rail at Fate.
Gray-eyed, with yellow hair, that spoke the Scotch
blood of your mother.
And, straight and strong, a man all through-a
bushman altogether --
You were the best mate that I had, who shall not
have another
To stand by me in sunny days or in the July
weather.
They've taken you across the sea to see strange
sights and wonders,
Perhaps forgetting Brolga run, the mustering,
and the shearing,
To hear the ping of bullets and the British cannon's
thunders,
And to learn there's something more in war than
uniforms and cheering.
The girls you've kissed will soon forget. The shed
starts next September.
Your stand will hold another chap, who will not
shear so clean;
But there is one you've left behind who ever will
remember
The mate you used to chum with in the gay
days that have been.
Do you remember when we ran the dingo to the
hollow,
And staked old Treason on a stump the long, dry
grass had hidden ?
You shouted me to ""Ride like fire,"" and you
would quickly follow.
Inever turned to look at you, but did as I was
bidden.
And when I found you late that night, your right
arm hanging broken,
Where jou had dragged yourself some way beside
the Brolga River,
You gave me just one look, to say that this should
be a token
That each of us would stand by each for ever and
for ever.
Perhaps they'll bring you back some day, all honour
on your shoulders,
And the Victoria Cross, to say that Queensland
has her brave.
Perhaps they'll leave you lying there among the
granite boulders ;
For there are no wreaths or railings for a lonely
soldier's grave.
But I shall jog along the same from loading up to
shearing,
Remembering how, amid the crowd, I stood alone
and saw
How some were wiping tears away, and some were
madly cheering,
While the best mate that I ever had was going to
the war.

No more the warm sap travels through the
veins.
The leaves the dead Spring bore have lost
their sheen;
Now pallid blotches overspread the green
That gleamed so brightly after summer rains.
They lie, all huddled, in the unswept lanes.
Add to the city streets' disordered scene,
Or limply drift to where late flowers have
been,
To form a sea of gold and crimson stains.
The few that to their parent bough still cling
Are tinged with brown, and all begrimed
with dust,
And like a bird with bruised and shattered
wing,
Are blown each way with every idle gust,
When autumn's vampire winds have sucked
their blood,
They, too, will find a grave in the cold mud.

And dogs lest half the populace

And every bird, from hawk to dove,
Save for the carrion crow.

No. 3.-""THE FIRST GENTLEMAN.""
I mite of the day when, dlsturb'd and astray,
Poor George the Third's wits were in very bad
way,
And his son-that fat person-was Regent, ,
A son who had been, since the age of sixteen, ]
His father's despair, and in scene after scene.
Had prov'd himself most disobedient.
(This criminal rhyme Is no worse than the
crime
That marked and distinguished that Regency
time,
So I use it as apt and expedient.)
in that era ""the go"" was for everything low
Saving ""play,"" which was ""high""-and George
Brummel, ""the Beau,""
«as arbiter elegant'arum;
An age drink-besotten, when worth was for-
gotten
And morals and boroughs were both of them
""rotten,""
As witness ""Old Q."" and Old Sarum,
""io"", truth to relate, there was much that
was great
when the patriot Pitt held the helm of the
State
And Wordsworth wrote lyric and sonnet,
»« the fact I must add that a character bad
Had the Prince who then held, on behalf of
his dad,
¿ne throne, tho' not actually on It.
¡us only ""strong suit"" was a love for the flute,
""n which at odd times he would pleasantly
toot,
»nd a taste for the arts and the graces:
out his voice it was hoarse and his figure was
coarse,
And to keep down his fat he had constant
resource
To tight-fitting corsets and laces.

--o--
The plains are silver!
The sky is white, and the fruit-blossoms are
white,
Shaking and shining in sun, an eddying haze.
The air hangs round them like unseen bees.
It rises from them laden and faint,
Beating its wings towards the mountains,
Settling on lips and nostrils.
The plains are gold!
The orange-trees waver in autumn haze.
The fruitage bursts through the green line
gold,
Or in the milder light dims and swells
Like great topazes moon-enchanted.
In the wind they are flames;
The stillness veils them in quivering smoke;
In the dusk they are vaporous echoes.
The plains are blue!
Beneath dawn, amethystine,
A runnel of lucerne-flowers;
Or, in the night-stillness of winter,
A mirror of heaven-calm,
Making flat earth an infinity

In answer to Ethel Turner, who once wrote
in a Sydney paper:—""One feels a little sad-
dened, a little despairing for one's own city
sometimes! How can a new nation ever
be more than trvial-soul'd or more than com-
mercially successful!"" . . . etc etc., in de-
scribing the beautiful old city of Florence.
Who sings of Florence? Tho' she be the Queen
Of old-world cities, here, 'neath Austral skies.
Mid Sydney's hill-girt water-valleys, lies
The lov'liest gem in nature's setting! Seen
In summer's moonless evenings, when the
sheen
Of harbour lights and ripples beautifies
The stilly deeps, and ferries, like fireflies,
The brightly jewell'd foreshores fit between;
The brightest star, o'erhead, with envy blinks,
So fair a vision doth delight the eye!
No theme for poet's lyre more truly grand!
And had'st thou sculptors, architects; me-
thinks
Not e'en fam'd Venice, then, could hope to vie
With thee. Queen City of my native land!
II.
Aye! Venice, even, and her silver sea,
And wondrous monuments: traditions fine;
Will someday pale before that fame of thine!
Which herewith is my stoutest prophecy!
I love to sing of thy great destiny:
For O, my native land, a fruitful vine
Art thou! And those poor, sorry souls,
supine,
Who cannot see thy promise, libel thee
When they do say thou'rt sterile of fair fame!
In many ways, already, dost thou lead
The sad ""old world,"" and lack but just the
time
That marks thy manhood, when they shall
acclaim
Thy ""rise from nought"" to fill the Empire's
need;
Thy wondrous courage, and thy faith sub-
lime.

The little home we used to know stands lonely
at the long day's close;
The roof had fallen long ago but for the inter-
lacing rose.
And through the ruined garden fold the
lingering light of sunset spills
Its immaterial dusty gold through golden
clumps of daffodils.
Through seedy grasses rambling free, the wild
raspberries climb and cling;
Still stands the silver wattle tree whose boughs
once held the children's swing.
Still falls the magpies' music loud from one
old group of knotted gums,
And, feathery as a falling cloud, still bloom
the clustered cherryplums;
Like kirtled ladies in a ring, in bracken
frondage to the knees,
And all their petals trembling with the little
black Australian bees.
I dreamed beneath the flowery yield; the pre-
sent ceased a little space;
I heard my fnther in the field, again I saw
my mother's face.
And from the river, shallow clear, heard un-
derneath the blackwood's boughs,
Clear voices on the evening air the young-
sters bringing up the cows. . . .
The bees had vanished from the bloom when
I awakened from my trance.
Only a bronzewing in the gloom crooned
muted to the hour's romance.
What is the fatal power the past still keeps
for human hearts alway?
The uzseless longing to the last for some lost
scene of yesterday?
The freshening evening breezes pelted petals
down like fairy rain.
Sudden my heart like wax was melted, and
I could not stem my pain.
In mockery they seemed to flout me, Love's
surviver lonely here
With all the daffodils about me, in the spring-
time of the year.

1 met a little raindrop
up on the Great Divide
1 said, ""Good day.
And what's the way
By which you hope to glide?
I guess you'll get a yard or two.""
But said the little drop:
'1 mean to go to Sydney,
The whole road to Sydney,
And nowhere short of Sydnev
Will I ever, ever stop.""
So 1 laughed, but he left me:
He splashed from his leaf.
And lie met a merry brother.
And they travelled with each other
A grassy road and brief
Down a slope with many more,
Till they found a running brook:
And bank-high fot Sydney,
By creek's bed for Sydney,
A brimming band for Sydney
Their pilgrimage thev took
Oh, the pert little raindrop.
He swam by himself.
He led the rank.«
Thro' Hawkesbury banks.
A racing river eli
Hast Windsor and past Wiseman'»
Till he came to Broken Bay:
And southward bound for Svdnej
Past Lion's Isle to Sydney
i It's rougher now lo Sydney,
And salter grows the spray.)
And so at last the raindrop.
With many millions more.
Mixed In the sea
Goes rolling free
To break on Sydney shore.
And a proud ship above them.
The North Head past.
Ride« the king tide to Sydney,
The hundredth league to Sydney:
So they that fared for Sydney
Are together there at last.

From a hamlet In Argyll,
Where his ancestors had foraged
In their Dandle Dinmont style;
You would hardly call him handsome,
And his legs would make you smile.

He objects to neighbours' cats;
He bars the way to strangers,
And he wages war on rats; ,
At times he even tries to eat
His master's shoes and hats.

In the early morning sun,
And' as they spun the silken threads
The sunbeams kissed each one.
The fairy barber came to buy
The silk that they had made;
He opened up his purse of gold,
And for the purchase paid.
His first assistant, Nimble Foot,
Then brushed each silken thread;
He twisted them and fashioned curls.
To fit a dainty head.
Then one night, when a little girl
Was very fast asleep,
He slipped In through the keyhole,
Just to have a peep.
With magic wand he touched her eyes,
To make them always bright.
He kissed her Ups and tweaked her nose,
And glued the curls on tight.
An elfin dance he lightly tripped
Upon the counterpane,
And then he spreads his wings and flew
Out through the door again.

dreaming--
Now you sail free, nor turn to mortal shore;
A star has beckoned you with holy gleaming,
Your songs are echoes now, for evermore.
You asked for time to dream thro' all life's
journey,
Now is the dream complete, the voyage o'er.
Australia loves your songs, you radiant singer,
Soul of the bush-land and the sweeping

The glowing gum-tops and the whisp'ring
shadows--
Bewitching fancies all your poems crown;
You wove your love of colour, flowers, music,
Till all the waves of rich enchantment
drown.
The last of all your lovely words are spoken,
Your busy pen lies hushed in silent rest;
The door is closed, the weary spirit drifted--
Gone with the autumn leaves-'tis well, 'tis

How fare you now, with time for endless
dreaming?

Deep in mystery.

Tall sails daring,
And deeds are to do.

We walked an airy mile
Through buttercup and daisyland
Two dreams to wait-a-while.
The paths were all of shining gold,
And by a mossy pool,
A podgy froggie aeons old
Was ringing time to school.
The schoolhouse was a sugarloaf,
The cane a chocolate stick,
Each scholar, wisehead, dunce, and oaf,
Assembled tick by tick.
And when the teacher called the roll
Each answered, ""By and by.""
At Wait-a-while the school was droll,
You never heard a sigh.
The lessons made you laugh to learn.
Two sunbeams make a smile
Was the worst sum; for tables turn
In school at Wait-a-While.
If anything was hard to do,
Like turn and turn about,
The pupils turned the teacher blue,
By shouting, ""School is out.""

Of dreams at Wait-a-while,
The holidays were shutting up
The school with half-a-smile.

Which several were drawing from different

One drew where the shade fell, another the light;
From each point of view all the drawings were
good;—

And the shsde that may fall on the part that
they see.
To whispers of doubt we should never give ear;
Our neighbours are human: besides, after all,
If kindly observed it might plainly appear
Wo looked from a point where a shadow must
fall.

Than a one-sided portrait from some shaded
part,

Would all bo made up If wo b*w but the heart.

BY CHRISTOPHUS.
THE singer mute, the lyre unstrung,
Dust- first from off earth's bosom sprung—
To earth return!
Yet a great quenchless torch of song,
Lit by no feeble hand, shall strong
For ever burn.
Its light shall shine from strand to strand,
And, blazing o'er that Western land,
The ocean span;
And great posterity shall read
The tenets of a Christ-like creed-
Good will to man.
And though within the grave they lay
An earthly tenement of clay,
And mourn thy loss,
Thou standest by thy Master's side
Who for thy sake was crucified
Upon the cross.
Far truer honour than the wreath

Which decks thy tomb,
Was the great throb of sympathy
For all those near and dear to thee,

CHRISTOPHUS.
I SEE a tiny band
Hemmed in on every side.
No succour near!
Within their breasts no hopes abide!
Those comrades dear
Stand manfully, with patriots' pride,
And bravely raise their war-cry here—
"" God and the Fatherland !""
They hear the dread command.
The foes close up around
With solid walls of steel.
But well those heroes stand their ground.
—The first ranks backwards reel:
Others to fill their place are found;
Still rings the mighty peal—
"" God and the Fatherland!""
But long they cannot stand-
Outnumbered ten to one.
Half those brave hearts are down;
And, ere yon westering sun
Gives place to evening's frown,
For Freedom's cause not one
Will shout 'gainst Austria's crown
""God and the Fatherland!""
Life-blood of Switzerland!
Backbone of Freedom's cause!
True patriots all!
Freely your heart-blood pours!
Singly you fall;
Dying in Austria's wars.
Hear ye the clarion call!—
"" God and the Fatherland!""
With dripping sword in hand,
Last in the fray,
Warrior staunch and stout
Keeps them at bar.
Closely they press about—
Crowd round—their prey
Cries with defiant shout
"" God and the Fatherland!""
Last of that tiny band
Weary and worn;
Wounded—can scarcely stand;
Armour all torn;
Behind a wall of dead
Comrades whom once he led—
Comrades with whom he bled;
Swift speeds a ball of lead-
Fulfils its mission dread;
Soon will his life have fled.
Raising his dying head,
Proudly these words he said:
""God and the Fatherland!""
Unhappy Switzerland!
Fast flies the news—
""Dead all our patriot band!
No time to lose!""
Rise up, ye mountain sons!
Load up your chamois guns;
Revenge the murdered ones;
Join hand to hand!
Mothers whose sons have bled,
Maidens with lovers dead,
Wives whose last hope has fled,
Tearfully stand,
Raising their weeping eyes
To the calm star-lit skies,
Firmly each voice replies—
""God and the Fatherland!""",The Queenslander ,"418,254,313,474,524,656,378,666,705,503,568,447,447,748,606,631,510,497,527,450,624,500,565,518,625,497,476,553,312,558,279,442,481,497,545,288,485,350,474,454,438,496,397,325,563,304,397,553,559,506,454,490,425,542,499,414,369,506,306,494,519,527,344,564,481,578,290,494,457,496,497",Sat 22 Dec 1883,"1939,4528,2020,2049,2085,2115,2161,2184,2219,2249,2307,2342,2375,2408,2444,2476,2510,2545,2598,2635,2666,2702,2734,2767,2802,2838,2926,2961,2995,3027,3063,3096,3129,3164,3219,3254,3287,3323,3356,3391,3424,3457,3512,3546,3580,3616,3647,3683,3717,3750,3781,3817,3852,3885,3918,3973,4008,4043,4076,4109,4143,4178,4211,4244,4279,4312,4346,4381,4414,4449,4482","611,972,602,540,608,476,611,471,471,540,504,438,504,438,502,438,501,537,501,534,502,535,501,537,502,537,502,535,635,501,636,501,534,537,502,535,499,535,499,534,499,537,499,535,499,535,499,499,499,501,499,499,499,499,532,501,535,502,535,501,502,501,535,501,502,501,537,502,502,502,539",19795313,Page 993

The River in Calm.
ROBERT LEIGHTON.
A CHARM is thine, O River I rage or rest;
And if thy storms enrapture us, thy calms
Do none the leas into the mortal breast
Pour their immortal balm.

Hesting upon their shadows, and, far through
The sonny deeps, the clouds, like sacred arks,
Floating in gulf* of blue I

Heard, but themielTes unseen, far up the stream;
The ferry steamers and their trailing smoke,

WORDS are lighter than the cloud-foam
Of the restless ocean spray;
Vainer than the trembling shadow
That the next hour steals away.
By the fall of summer rain drops
Is the air as deeply stirred;
And the rose-leaf that we tread on
Will outlive a word.
Yet, on the dull silence breaking
With a lightning-flash, a word,
Bearing endless desolation
On its lightning wings, I heard.
Earth can forgo no keener weapon,
Dealing surer death and pain :
And the cruel echo answered
Through long months again.
I have known one word hang star-like
O'er a dreary waste of years,
And it only shone the brighter
Looked at through a "" mist of tears;""
While a weary wanderer gathered
Hope and heart on life's dark way
By its faithful promise shining
Clearer day by day.
I have known a spirit calmer
Than the calmest lake, and clear
As the heavens that gazed upon it,
With no wave of hope or fear;
But a storm had swept across it,
And its deepest depths were stirred
Never, never, more to slumber—
Only by a word.
Words are mighty, words are living;
Serpents with their venomed stings,
Or bright angels, crowding round us
With heaven's light upon their wings.
Every word has its own spirit,
True or false, that never dies;
Every word man's lips have uttered
Echoes in God's skies.

R. SPENCER BROWNE.
The ringdove sat on the oaken tree;
Oh. the moon shone- bright and the night was clear;
And her low soft spread o'er the lea;
Oh, the pale stars gleamed and the night was clear.
The maidon stood by the garden gate;
On, the moon shone brlghtand the night was dear;
And she watched for her lover of nigh estate;
On, the soft winds breathed through the scented air.
The mother smilod, and hor heart beat high;
On. the moon ehono bright and the night was clear;
And her firstborn played 'neath her loving eye;
On, the moonbeams pale by that scene so fair.
But the ringdove mourns for hor absent mate:
On, the moon sinks low and the night grows drear;
And the maiden weeps at the garden gate;
On, her lovo is false, and he once was dear.
The mother waits, and her eyes are wild;
Oh, the moonlight's fled and the- storm-clouds

How shall I paint in words thine image fair,
Set in a background of red-winged light,
Glinting through portieres of soft foliage there,
Gold-flecked ere fading into deepening night?
List to the music of cascades which pour
Their liquid silver tribute down the steep
To moss-clad boulders, where it bubbles o'er,
And fronoled ferns in verdurous beauty peep.
Breathless I wait near thy pellucid stream
To view some woodland nymph with flashing
feet
And brow, flower-bound for this alluring dream--
A witching Flora in this cool retreat.
Pensive I grow until the bell-bird's note--
Organ-like, pealing in its grand solemnity -
Brings haunting memories, as the deep tones
float,
Of vanished hours-lost chords of melody.
Crowned in magnificence is thy majestic head,
Queenly thy royal robe of purple grace,
With tender nuausem o'er dewy verdure spread,
Where the Pacific's jasper waves embrace.
Whether in winnowed raiment of the crystal
dawn,
Or golden mantle of the sun's rich ore,
Or jewelled scarf star studded round thee worn,
Thy smiles or tears but charm me more and more.
Farewell, thy statey beauty! Stay -- a thought
Hath touched the deep recesses of my soul --
Thou standest, thou Colossus, tempest wrought,
A Beacon on Time's sea to mark a shoal!

GLAD with the coolness of winter time,
B[?]a thing the breath of a fresh'ning clime.
That hove[?]s about the mounts that swell
Round the bosky dingles where I dwell:
Sweetly 1 chant in the moroing bright,
In the goldon day, and In eve's faint light
Charming tho scrub and bill and sky
And thp'snowy-ftiood clouds as they saunter by.
Whoever my richest strain would hear
With a prudent heed must draw him near;
As the spiny aut-oator modost and coy,
A rud'o uDproaoh would mo annoy;
No duok-blll teazling his dark hair by
Tho murmuring river is half so shy;
O had less of dlffldenco been my store
You might have heard my sweet song before t
0 what beauty abides in my bowera of ease.
Whether ferns adorn or stinging-trees I
Where the fragrant oodars scent the sir, >
Or tho regnant gums loom tall and fair;
Where their round blue plums tho quandongs
throw,
Or the go-ity-ankled bottle-trees grow;
Whilo the coachman cracks or butcher-birds
scream,
Or float by roaellas like the birds of a dream t
My cheerisoroe lay inspirits the breeze
As 1 flutter my wings in the wind-bathei trees;
And mr wondrous lyre with pride I unfold . .
Ip, the dented sides of the Alps so old;
Whon I sing. However may some complain.
Our life holds more of pleasure thin pain;
Or swuelly preach, Wlntetfcr its woe.
A mightier good aoth the world o'erjtovo,
With humorous echo sometimes I please
The feathery angels of the trees;
And mimic the crow and cockatoo,
And curie w gray and jackass too:
Or with parrots-chirp or boll-bird's cry
Or eagm s soroeoh I rUUs the sky;
Or startle tho grunting koala when
With a dingo's whoop I scare the gloa.
Yot never a magpie's morning hymn,
Or mawpawk'a oall in the evening dim.
Is so soft or sweet or rich in tone
As the voice melodious that is my own,'
Whon I Bing of love whore tho myalls wave,
Or flourish my jdv from a bunya brave;
While below tbe billowy scrub-land green >
And the distant rim of the sea are seen.
Aa incarnate joy, I blithely sing,
And tho gullicß with blithenets responsive ring;
So happy myself, i-eema happy to me
Kaeh bird of tho broke, oaoh thing that J boo,
From those flying flowers the butterflies
To the oa-glehawk in tho upper skies—

'Tin a lease of enjoyment merely to live!

NOVEMBER.
A.J. ROLFE.
What a glory doth this world put on
For him who with a fervent heart goes forth.
LONGFELLOW.
The waves of golden light spread in the East,
Flooding the sky with glory; o'er the hills
The King of Day mounts slowly; and released
From sleep, the world, refreshed from toils and ills,
Its round begins; fair Nature's lovely face
Smiles on the glorious handiwork of God,
Teaching her willing votary to trace
The Artist Hand in paths that few have trod.
The birds are caroling their joyous lay,
The fragrance-breathing flowers lovingly
Send forth their grateful thanks; and far away
The mountains lift their heads in ecstasy.
All Nature gladly shouts in one long strain
A long of love; and earth resounds again.",The Queenslander ,"898,480,669,536,239,218,601,756,224,758,707,772,868,707,691,604,754,650,680,781,707,710,705",Sat 12 Nov 1892,"345,863,1000,1049,1134,1803,1213,1243,1287,1332,1372,1397,1430,1465,1498,1534,1561,1598,1628,1663,1696,1728,1761","321,542,443,513,663,984,411,411,975,331,362,331,364,331,364,331,364,331,364,331,364,331,331",19828991,Page 929

Would bind theo evermore to earth;
"" And nothing that thy splendour cost

Thine Is a dignity beyond
Tho glories of the diamond.

It is better to die, since death comes surely,
In the full noontide of an honoured nam[?],

A handful of dust in a shroud of shame.

How he won the love of a prince's daughter—
A poor knight he with a stainlen* sword—
Whereat Count Ro f, who had vainly sout-ht her,
Swore dentil should sit at the bridal board.
A braggart* threat, for a brave nan's scorning t
And Hugo laughed at hia rival's ire,
But couriers twain, oa the bridal morning,
To his castle gate oame with tidings dice.

And all is lost if they win tho ford.""

When tbe crucifixion of Lore is there!
What nead to tell of tho message spoken—
Of the hand that shook a-* he'po<Bt>d his lance T
And tbo look that told of his brave heartbroken,
As he bade them follow—"" For God and francs!""
On Oambray's field next morn thoy found him,
'Mid a mighty swathe of foe-men dead;
Her snow-white scarf he had bound arauad him
With his loyal blood was baptised red.
It is all writ down in the book of glory.
On orimson pages of blooi and strife,
With scanty thouvht for tho simple story
Of duty dearer than love or life.
Only a note obseur-, appended

Or did roysUring *BJplf move a better mate! v

A Forest Fortune-teller.
[WRITTEN FOR THE 'QUEENSLANDER' CHRISTMAS
SUPPLEMENT.]
BY MARY HANNAY FOOTT.
She was a gray old gum-tree,
Her leaves were tough and few,
And her trunk was but a hollow shell
That the breezes whistled through;
The cleverest old gum-tree-
Ten thousand things she knew.
The saplings crowded round her
When they heard her branches creak;
They loved to list to her stories old,
And they loved to hear her speak
Of youth's far golden future —
The middle of next week.
' O Gum-tree, good old Gum-tree,'
One eve the saplings said,
We have done our task of growing,
And all the day have spread
Soft shade o'er the tender flowers,
And they are safe in bed.
' And, please, we want a story—
With doings weird and dire—
The fierce cyclone that wastes the woods-
Forked lightning—wild bush fire—
And a brave youug tree that holds his own
Till all his foes expire.'
The gum-tree smiled upon them—
Those saplings slim and green;
Quoth she, 'The best of little trees
You one and all have been.
'Tis meet I should reward you.'
(She spoke like any Queen!)
' Now, will you have a story
Of what long since befel ?
Or a tale of the town that here shall stand?
Or your fortunes shall I tell?'
'Our fortunes!' shouted the saplings,
' Oh, that will please us well '
*'Far, far off,' said the gum-tree,
' Lies ocean broad and deep.
It has hills and dales that rise and fall
As the strong winds wake and sleep.
And the swift ships have their highway
Wherever its surges sweep.
'And you shall be a ship's mast,
O sapling of the pine,
And winged with white shall bear abroad
The treasure of the mine,
And the golden fleece, and the colours proud
That every flag outshine.
'And you, my sturdy kinsman,
In years to come, shall keep
The restless herd when the fires are low
And the weary bushmen sleep;
For you shall be a gate-post
And set full four feet deep.
'And you, O fragrant cedar,
Aloft the roof shall bear
Of the House where faithful souls resort,
Of the Home of praise and prayer.
Oh happy e'en the humblest
Who findeth haven there!
' And some the storms shall shatter;
And some the fires shall sear;
And some with gladsome ember-glow
The hearth of love shall cheer;
And one—of all the forest
The last—shall linger here.
'And ye that dwell in the city,
And ye that sail the sea,
And ye that bide in the woodland wide
Whither Heaven's wildings flee—
The shelter of the shelterless—
Still blessed may you be !'",The Queenslander ,"905,644,14,257,475,537,583,691,642,535,572,587,699,657,614,562,468,650,469,677,518,631,463,600,546,788,639,795,422,633,568,641,498,582,520,521,475,797,548,691,557,606,513,705,671,721,496,594,395,765,468,824,460,571,515,735,571,520,504,528,449,757,642,520,480,665,548,696,563,480,501,568,450,721,619,569,480",Sat 21 Dec 1889,"435,580,828,838,691,901,942,984,1031,1074,1120,1203,1246,1291,1335,1383,1427,1509,1554,1598,1644,1688,1734,1817,1861,1906,1951,1994,2038,2123,2169,2211,2257,2301,2346,2424,2469,2512,2561,2602,2649,2728,2775,2817,2868,2909,2956,3038,3085,3128,3175,3216,3263,3346,3394,3438,3479,3524,3569,3650,3698,3737,3784,3828,3872,3957,4003,4046,4091,4135,4175,4261,4307,4351,4397,4443,4487","2279,2403,3187,2597,2477,2315,2389,2315,2389,2312,2389,2315,2389,2313,2394,2315,2392,2318,2394,2318,2389,2315,2389,2315,2394,2315,2394,2315,2392,2315,2392,2315,2395,2315,2395,2317,2391,2313,2392,2315,2392,2312,2391,2312,2387,2312,2386,2313,2391,2309,2386,2310,2387,2312,2384,2309,2383,2310,2381,2310,2384,2309,2387,2312,2386,2309,2386,2309,2387,2312,2389,2312,2386,2312,2389,2312,2386",19819562,Page 14

CHRISTOPHUS.
THE calm silent bush and the wide yellow plain.
The gaunt weird-like gum-trees which stud the lone creek.
Have a charm which elsewhere you may look for in vain-
Have a language which Nature has taught them to speak;
And the eweet wattle bloom with its fragrance is dear
To the heart of each wandering bush cavalier.
The plains and the mountains, the creeks and the trees,
All Nature's great book filled with wondrous lore.
Are the pastes most loved and most studied by these.
Who live far away from the great cities' roar;
And who lie down to sleep with the stars overhead,
A saddle their pillow, the brown turf their bed.
When the thunder of thousand hoofß makes the ground tremble
With the rush of the scrubbers across the wide plain,
There's a rapturo that no other joy oan resemble
In racing to head them and whoel them again.
For the stook-rider knows neither dangers nor fears,
And what jockey a can ride like the bush cavaliers?
There's a pleasure in breathing the pure atmosphere.
And in feeling alone, independent, and free;
There's a music a stockman loves bettor to hear
Than all other music wnatever it be;
And the stockwhip's sharp oraok ringing out true and dear
Is the sweetest of sounds to the bush cavalier.
When the first rays of ruby light flush the gray morning.
And cap the blue hills with a mantle of gold;
Ere the last star of night has been lost in the dawning.
The billy is boiling, the swags are all rolled.
And before half the world has yet welcomed the day
The knights of the saddle are riding away.
When the great orb of light has just sunk in the West,
Buffusing the sky with its warm after glow.
Ah! that is the time which the bushman loves best
To tell of the deeds he has done long ago.
When the rays from the oamp fire shine far in the night,
And all tongues are unloosened, all pipes are alight.
So wandering, wassailing (of tenest working).
And not always moody and not always gay,
Yet never a hardship or grim danger shirking.
And joking, and "" loving, and riding away;""
Still the wild roving life with its hardships is dear
To the heart of the wandering bush cavalier.
So fill up your glasses and drain a big bumper
To the free careless knights of the pigskin and spur,
With a little one in for each saucy buokjumper,
Who oan cause such a knight from hi a saddle to stir,
And all bold overlanders will honour you here
And drink to the health of each bush cavalier.",The Queenslander ,"529,268,885,1067,1063,1067,986,839,1017,907,956,841,940,861,1161,964,886,852,952,938,962,808,872,672,1076,832,1034,826,992,797,957,773,1001,795,935,750,1031,954,819,795,852,815,921,816,839,947,865,960,845,853",Sat 24 Apr 1886,"1668,3598,1753,1786,1814,1852,1896,1920,1987,2020,2055,2088,2121,2154,2222,2257,2290,2323,2356,2391,2458,2491,2521,2559,2592,2627,2693,2726,2759,2794,2822,2860,2926,2962,2995,3028,3060,3096,3162,3197,3230,3263,3296,3331,3397,3430,3465,3496,3532,3565","2290,2906,1918,1951,1918,1950,1917,1917,1917,1950,1918,1953,1917,1917,1920,1951,1917,1950,1917,1917,1917,1951,1917,1950,1917,1917,1917,1951,1917,1950,1917,1917,1917,1950,1917,1948,1917,1917,1917,1950,1917,1950,1917,1917,1917,1950,1918,1951,1917,1917",19804792,Page 609

The Clever Cat.
M.H.F.
Brisbane.
There was a cat called William—
The poorest ever seen;
He would not go a mousing—
He played the tambourine!
His family would not feed him—
Thia lazy little cat—
Aud out of door* they turned him—
(They huw no way but that).
80 on and on he wandered
Till he to Catland came;
And there he met a Princess—
Felinu was her name.
Slie had the loveliest whisker*,
Her eyes were emerald preen;
She fell in love with William-
All for hi« tambourine!
For her delight was dancing,
And there was none to play—
"" Strike up!"" she straight commandad
When William came that way.
All day xhe danced. At sunset,
Poor William at her feet
Knelt down and said, "" Pray may I
Huve something now to eat I""
""To eat! Of course! What ho, there!""
(Feliimhudnobell;
But when nhe called her servant*,
Her Hwcut voice did us well.)
Then tortoiseshells and tabbies
Tripped o'er each others' tails;
All MRurrying from the kitchen
With cream-cakes ani stewed snails.
Now half a dozen dinners
Were brought him every day—
And "" mouse"" was never mentioned—
Hi» brothers came to stay
(For thru hftd heard of Catland,
Where William'o word was law);
And by-aud-by Felinu
Bestowed on him her paw.
There is a oat culled William—
The fattest ever peon ;

tuite a great deal more money to finish
it than was expected, she sold her dia-
monds in order that she might give the
money that was needed to complete the
building. One day, after the hospital had
been built, the princess went to visit tha
patients who were being treated in tho
different wards. As she stood by tho bed-
side of one of them, tears of gratitud«
Ulled the eyes of the sick man. Suddenly
the princess exclaimed, ""Oh, now I 6e«

Katie Jackson.
MARY H. FOOTT.
DROWNED IN THE FLOOD OF FEBRUARY, 1898.
AT BLACKWAALL, NEAR IPSWICH.
AGED 18 YEARS.
Have you heard of Katie Jackson,
Oar Queensland girl so brave,
And bow for three poor children
She sought in vain to save—
Her sisters and her brother—
Her own life Katie gave?
The mother and the children
Were all alone that day
When the flood beget their dwelling.
The father wished to stay,
Bat he had to drive bis engine, °
And was foroed to go away.
"" Oar Katie,"" said the mother,
"" Can swim bo well and row,
We are as s»fe witb Katie
As witb a man, we know.""
And once the boat went safely,
And twice they prayed might go.
On dry land stood the mother
By her good Katie's aid,
And watched the children coming.
Oh, who would be nfraid
To trust them to their Katie—
Strong-turned, stout-hearted maid T
And swift and safe she brought them,
Bnt midway struck a tree;
Caught in those eddjing waters,
Mo help nor hope could be;
But Katie, noble sister,
With fond arms clasped the three
Alas for Katie Jackson.
And those small ohildren dear!
Alas for the poor mother
Who watched them disappear,
And for the far-off father
Who fain had been a-near t
B»nd, girls of her o.rn Queensland,
Tour token to her grave-
In stainless stone the Symbol
Of Him who died to save;
And honour Katie Jackson—
The dutiful, the brave.

Far From Ireland.
Far away in my own dear country, long ago when I
was a child,
Once in the early springtime, with the east wind blowing
wild,
When the larch's crimson trawls were swinging light
o'erhead,
And violet and primrose were springing 'neath the
tread,
The March winds all were blowing the thin clouds off
the sky,
The moon had one-star burning within its crescent
high;
Juts between night and daylight, about the Angelus
ring,
When suddenly around me, I heard the fairies sing.
Oh it was sweet! wonderful, that, mystic woodless song
Heard in the dreaming mountains, the murmuring
trees among.
I stood 'mong the gold gorse blossoms, my befng held
in thrall,
And trees, and moon, and mountains seemed to be
listening all.
The music ceased, but for ever, whether by land or
sea,
Wherever my wandering found me, there has been no
rest for me,
For to hear the fairies singing is to be haunted by
the song,
And in sorrow or joy for the music of its mystic
sounds to long.
Evermore to be striving to catch its elusive refrain,
As it goes and comes, and stays, and yet will not be
heard again.
And it follows through all the dreaming and the
waking day by day,
And fills the soul with yearning that it cannot fill or
stay.
There is no respite from longing, in the weary days
I've spent
Since homeward on that far evening on the Connaught
hills I went,
Yet could I stand on Knock-na Roa, and hear the
March wind roar,
And see the green waves foaming on the yellow sand
once more.
Could I but stand there listening in the blue of the
evening mist,
My feet amid the blossoms the sun's last ray had kist.
What tho' the magic singing had death in its haunted ring,
Could I but be a child again, and hear the fairies sing.

SONG.
SULORAC.
A year ago I used to stray
Through forests echoing with joy;
That Cupid was a powerless boy.
I loved to watch the sky-lark soar;
The squirrel leap from bough to bough;
The flowers I loved—but nothing more—
Ah, things have changed since then and now t
Th%t simple life I live no more,
For all is changed since then and now.
A year ago I had not known
The magio of this little band
Of «rold and pearl and precious stoao—
To-day my darling claimed my hand.
My heart will break for very love I
The sguirrtl leaps from bough to bough,
The birds are carolling above,
Yet all is changed since then and now.

What hast thou done since then and now T",The Queenslander ,"441,140,150,430,562,531,570,657,659,752,507,627,464,470,636,611,569,660,488,629,537,692",Sat 7 Apr 1888,"3518,3606,4403,3698,3724,3791,3833,3857,3891,3923,3961,3991,4058,4090,4123,4156,4191,4224,4257,4290,4324,4356","693,844,1181,493,526,526,493,524,493,524,493,526,493,524,493,523,493,526,493,526,493,524",19931631,Page 529

Your trunk was flecked with mosses
green and grey,
Splendid against the turquoise blue of
skies,
While 'mid the branches errant winds
would play,
And feathered throats lilt sweetest

The settlers planned your death but

Soon by meek oxen to be borne away.

As the sharp axes, flashing in the sun,
Cleave with a singing rhythm until you
reel;
The work of execution has begun.
A tearing, grinding sound . . as crashing

Your limbs, and leaves lie o'er you like
a pall.
Twelve oxen wait to bear you down the

Their plodding hooves will land you
miles below;
How slowly beautiful you grew, while
strange
Weird rites were held by totems, none
may know,
Save pixie shapes which danced in moon-
lit zones,
And you, who heard Daramulu's deep
tones.
To some boudoir, with its distinctive air,
Your silken grainings may lend added
charm,
And softly mirror beauty's profile fair,
Who dreams of love with dimpled chin
in palm ....
But will she think of you as once you
stood,
Magnificent, a doyen of the wood?
Only, a tree: emblem of some brave man,
With proud head lifted, though in
mortal pain,
Who, doomed, calm, and dispassionately,
can
Meet dissolution with a cold dis-
dain ....
Down ranks of sentinels which whisper
low,
You, with twelve brown-eyed oxen,
slowly go.

Sister of sleep, healer of life, divine

To set the soul that love could set not free,
To bid the skies that day could bid not shine,
To give the gift that life withheld was thine.

And all my heart bows down and praises thee,
Death, that baat now made grief not his but mine.

Torn back our hearts from sorrow; this alone
We bid, we pray thee, from tby sovereign throne

In Snow-Time.
HOW should I choose to walk the world with thee,
Mine own beloved ? When green grass is stirred
By summer br[?]zes, and each leafy tree
Shelters the nest of many a singing bird ?
In time of roses, when the earth doth 110
Dressed in a garment of midsuiumer hue»,
Beneath • canopy of aapphire sky,
Lulled by a aoft wind's song ? Or should I choose
T<> walk with the* along a wintry-road,
Through nWworles* fields, thiok-aown with frosty rime,
Beuuie an ice-bound stream, whose watora flowed
In voiceless music all the summer time?
In winter dreariness, or summer glee,
How should I choose to walk the world with thee ?
The time of roses is the time of lore,
Ah, my dear heart! but winter flies are bright,
And in the lack of sunshine from above
We tend more carefully love's saored light
The path among the roses lleth soft
Sun-kissed and radiant under youthful feet;
But on a wintry way true hands more oft
Do meet and cling in pressure close and sweet.
There is more need of lore's supporting arm
Aloug life's slippery pathway in its frost,
There U more need for love to wrap us warm,
Against life's cold, when summer flowers are lost.
Let others share thy life's glad summer glow,
But let me walk beside thee in ito mow t

I'm a broken-hearted shearer, I'm ashamed to show
my face,
The way that I got lambed down is a sin and a
disgrace;
I put a cheque togother, and thought that it would do,
S0 I just slipped into Orange for to spend a week or
two.
I thought I was no flat, so resolved to cut it fat;
I dressed myself up in my best, put a poultice round
my hat;
I went to have a nobbler at a certain house in town,
Where the barmaid she was cautioned for to lamb a
fellow down.
I would get up in the morning to have a glass of stout;
She cost me many a shilling, for she was in every
shout.
She would t0ss me up at Yankee Grab, and keep me
on the booze:
But somehow or the other I was always bound to lose.
My money getting short I resolved to know my fate;
I asked this pretty barmaid if she would be my mate,
When she said, ''Young man, on my feelings don't
encroach,
I'm a decent married woman, and my husband drives
the coach.""
I had two-and-six in silver and half-a-bar of soap,
A box of Cockle's pills and a pot of Holloway's;
I thought to turn a farmer and grow pumpkins near
the town,
But she squashed all my pumpkins when she had me
lambed down.
I had two old shirts, but they were all in rags;
A pair of moleskin trousers and a hat without a crown.

ii one of the angels to he.
At the clo»e of a beautiful life
It is meet that his name should be known,
Whose oouscienee is more than a wife—
Who dares to be righteous alone.
Away where the fftoe of the harsh
Wild mountain looks out of the fog,
Beyond n black furlong of marsh,
Is the hut of old Jack and his dog.
Twelrt) winter* of thundor and four
Have beateu tho bark of it thin;
But the blowing of Qod evermore
Remains with the hermit within.
The rafters are rotting away,
And bitter winds travel across
The roof with whose sorrowful gray
Is mingled the green of the moss.
In a wildernesß desolate—deep,
The ruined hut shakes in the blast;
Bnt peace is with Jack in his sleep,
And ho sticks to his home to the last
Lot only a buahman is Hayes,
Unable to read or to write;
But truth ia in all that he says,
And his heart U as pure as tho light.
A knowledge direct from Abovo
Has given him wisdom indeed,
A spirit illumined with love
And the child's irreproachable creed.
Just forty-five summer* ago
He landed in shame and in ohains;
But a soul that is fairer than snow
Is all of the "" lag"" that remains.
There is none of ns here who can oast
A stone of rebuke at his head:
He haa hidden the sin of the past
In the light of the life he has led.
He lias loved like the rest, and has lost
gome darlings he sorrows for now;
But a glory of hair like the frost
Beams over a passionless brow.
A cripple these twenty years past-
One maimed in the arm and the leg-
He works in the woods to the last
For the bread that he never will beg.
Karrare, the beautiful brook,
The daughter of fountains aloof,
Flows evermore down by the nook—
By the grove over Jack and his roof.
Where the psalm of the stream and the reeds
Make holy wild places untrod,
He, crowned by immaculate deeds,
Bits patiently waiting for God.",The Queenslander ,"850,485,320,353,354,454,497,545,553,533,478,543,472,562,493,403,476,674,622,509,532,570,529,540,570,522,532,523,457,477,567,518,488,566,557,587,480,432,499,577,502,484,449,575,448,553,553,509,592,685,530,528,618,547,514,482,560,597,532,580,465,512,575,568,711,477,551,480",Sat 15 Jan 1881,"293,600,724,805,850,877,912,943,978,1013,1046,1079,1137,1172,1202,1238,1271,1304,1339,1372,1428,1460,1496,1526,1564,1597,1633,1665,1723,1756,1787,1822,1855,1888,1923,1956,2013,2047,2082,2112,2148,2181,2216,2247,2306,2337,2372,2405,2439,2472,2506,2539,2594,2630,2663,2698,2734,2764,2798,2831,2888,2921,2956,2989,3020,3057,3090,3124","392,551,646,628,534,491,461,491,458,491,457,490,455,490,457,493,457,493,460,494,457,493,458,494,457,494,457,493,458,493,457,496,460,493,457,493,457,493,457,494,457,491,455,493,455,493,455,494,455,493,458,496,458,494,460,494,458,496,460,494,458,493,458,498,460,493,460,493",20704514,Page 73

The creek runs by a skirting scrub,
Where, underneath the shade,
I lay and listened to the sough
The oak tree sighing made.
Its foliage seemed still to breathe
A raonotono of pain,
And Life's enigma rose onoe more
To vex a wearied brain.
Its dreamy undercurrent breathed
Of undeserved wrong,
While thoughtfully I pondered whence
Tbo she-oak learned its song.
""Didst learn it of the moaning surf
That ehafeß its bounds in vain.
That sound as when, on distant roofs,
Is laahod the falling rain ?""
""In youthful prime my roots sank deep
Be.ow the creek, unseen,
Where moans and ohafes the fretted wave
Its hinu'ring stones between.
"" The sad complaint rose with my sap,
Became a part of me,
And sighs for aye among ray leaves
Like voioes from the sea.
"" •£*• long drought came; the creek was dry;

For water in its rand-choked bed,
And hoarsely lowed for pain.

[Some readers who have been kind enough to send
in contributions for this column evidently do not
understand that only bush songs are wanted. The
majority of so-called songs sent in are simply poems,
often of the sender's own composition. While some
of these are worthy of publication, and are therefore
held with a view to future insertion, they can have no

THE OLD BULLOCK DRAY.
(Supplied by W. M'C., Rockhampton.)
Oh! the shearing is all over and the wool is coming
down,
And I mean to get a wife, boys, when I go down to
town;
Everything has a mate that presents itself to view,
From the little paddymelon to the jumping kangaroo.
And now I've got a big cheque I mean to buy a team;
And when I get a missus, boys, I will be all serene ;
By applying at the depot I hear there's no delay
In getting an offside partner for an old bullock dray.
Chorus.—So roll up your blunkets and let us make a
push,
I'll take you up the country and show you
the bush.
You won't get the same chance, I'll be
bound, another day,
So cme on and take possession of my old
bullock dray.
We'll have no odd notions about the honeymoon;
We'll join hands together and jump across the broom,
For it's the fashion of the country, and we won't be the
first;
What we save in the parson we'll spend on the burst.
I'll take care of beef and damper that you'll have quite
enough;
We'll boil in the bucket such a whopper of a duff,
And our mates will all dance in honour of the day
To the music of the bells of the old bullock dray.
We'll live like fighting cocks—for good living I'm your
man—
We'll have ""leather-jackets"" and johnny-cakes and
fritters in the pan,
And if you fancy fish I'll get them for you soon,
We'll dive for barramuudi on the banks of the lagoon.
I'll teach you with the whip the bullocks how to flog,
You shall be my offsider when we're stuck in the bog;
You'll cut about, right and left, all that comes in your
way,
There'll be hair and skin flying round the old bullock
dray.
Now it's time I got your answer if there's one to be
had;
I would not treat that steer in the body half so bad.
You pay no more attention—you don't, upon my
soul!—
Than that old man stag offside in the pole.
It is all your own fault, at your door will be the sin,
I'll be off up the oountry and marry a black gin,
""Cabbon white fellow! budgery! baal gammon?""
she will say,
""Budgery you and your old bullock dray.""
So roll up your blankets and let us make a push,
I'll take you up the country and show you the bush.
You won't get the same chauce, I'll be bound another
day,

They puzzle scientific gents as well

A porch with a climbing rose;
Walls of stucco and leadlighf panes
(The daughter ordered those!)
A seagrass lounge and a seagrass chair
To rest in on summer days,
And stare at the passer up and down
With a kindly, curious gaze.
A garage, built for a motor car;
A hedge beside the gate,
And a kennel for the sleek brown dog
That sits about in state.
1 brough many years tiley saved for this,
Against Life's vv;ind and rain,
Struggled, and toiled, and suffered, too,
Ahd who shall call it vain?
Hunger, and Care, and Want they knew,
And the old bag Heart's Despair,
But ever before them shone the sight
Of this bungalow- so fair. . . .
And now thev sit in the prosperous sun,
Or dig in the garden new,
And their door is openecLjr-idc, we know,
For the good that they can do.
For their hearts are as they vvere of old,
Should you lift the new gate latch
Simple, sincere, and strangely warm,
With a welcome just to match.

Arid Poverty's lost its fear,
And the nearest thing to heaven on

Is Suburbia small end dear ! '

I built myself a splendid dwelling-
place,
An airy castle proud;
Its lights the stars the green eaves
interlace,
Its bastions of cloud.
I wove myself a wondrous cloak of
dreams
All Jacaranda-blue
And crimson of the waratah, and
gleams
Of moon-fire threaded through.
I made me dear companions of the
winds
That smudge the placid pool;
The creamy flowering woodbine that
entwines
The rose-hung arbours cool.
The unnamed blossoms growing
starry-eyed
In ferny bushland aisles;
The storm-wind, shouting in un-
trammelled pride
Down the long forest miles.
You lost the keys of mine own castled
steep,
Trampled my dreams, and made a
mock of them;
The magic cloak I always thought to
keep
You tore from hem to hem.
I seek for comfort where the red
leaves burn
In old, familiar ways of flower and
tree;
My old companions know me not, and
turn
Their faces far from me.
Shivering and homeless, my soul seeks
in grief
For shelter while the storms of life
go by ;
If this be done in days of the green
leaf.
What of the sere and dry?

Where 'mid the changeful aeons changeless thy people stood*!
Land of the birch and buckthorn, home of the hoary oak.
Where the songs of LJywarch linger, and the words that Merlin spoke t

BLEST he, though undistinguish'd from the crowd
By wealth or dignity, who dwells secure,
Where man, by nature fierce, has laid aside
His fierceness, having learnt, though slow to learn,
The manners and the arts of civil life.
His wants indeed are many; but supply
Is obvious, placed within the easy reach
Of temp'rate wishes and industrious hands.
Here virtue thrives as in her proper soil;
Not rude and surly, and beset with thorns,
And terrible to sight, as when she springs
(If e'er she springs spontaneous) in remote
And barbarous climes, where violence prevails,
And strength is lord of all; but gentle, kind,
By culture tam'd, by liberty refreshed,
And all her fruits by radiant truth matured
War and the chase engross the savage whole;
War followed for revenge, or to supplant
The envied tenants of some happier spot;
The chase for sustenance, precarious trust!
His hard condition with severe constraint
Binds all his faculties, forbids all growth
Of wisdom, proves a school, in which he learns
Sly circumvention, unrelenting hate,
Mean self-attachment, and scarce aught beside,
Thus fare the shiv'ring natives of the north,
And thus the rangers of the western world,
Where it advances far into the deep,
Tow'rds the antarctic. E'en the favour'd isles
So lately found, although the constant sun
Cheer all their seasons with a grateful smile,
Can boast but little virtue; and, inert
Through plenty, lose in morals what they gain
In manners—victims of luxurious ease.
These, therefore I can pity, plac'd remote
From all that science traces, art invents,
Or inspiration teaches; and enclos'd
In boundless oceans, never to be pass'd
By navigators uninform'd as they,
Or plough'd perhaps by British bark again:
But far beyond the rest, and with most cause,
Thee, gentle savage * ! whom no love of thee
Or thine, but curiosity perhaps
Or else vain glory, prompted us to draw
Forth from thy native bow'rs, to show thee here
With what superior skill we can abuse
The gifts of Providence, and squander life.
The dream is past; and thou hast found again
Thy cocoas and bananas, palms and yams,
And homestall thatch'd with leaves. But hast thou found
Their former charms? And, having seen our state,
Our palaces, our ladies, and our pomp
Of equipage, our gardens and our sports,
And heard our music; are thy simple friends,
Thy simple fare, and all thy plain delights,
As dear to thee as once? And have thy joys
Lost nothing by comparison with ours?
Rude as thou art (for we return'd thee rude
And ignorant, except of outward show)
I cannot think thee yet so dull of heart
And spiritless, as never to regret
Sweets tasted here, and left as soon as known.
Methinks I see thee straying on the beach,
And asking of the surge, that bathes thy foot,
If ever it has wash'd our distant shore.
I see thee weep, and thine are honest tears,
A patriot's for his country: thou art sad
At thought of her forlorn and abject state,
From which no pow'r of thine can raise her up.
COWPER.
* Omai, the native of one of the Friendly Islands, who
is thus beautifully apostrophized by Cowper, acted as
interpreter to Captain Cook in his third voyage round
the world. His natural quickness and his fidelity rendered
him of considerable use to our great navigator in his
intercourse with the natives of the South Seas. Omai
was brought by Cook to England, where he was treated
with much kindness, and introduced into the best society.
The ease and even elegance of his manners was an object
of surprise ; — but almost all the uncivilised people of this
part of the world, and more especially the New Zea
landers, have exhibited the same natural respect for the
opinions and feelings of others which is the foundation of
real politeness. Dr. Johnson speaks of Omai ob showing
tho deportment of a well-bred gentleman. Omai was not
? person of consequence, that is a chief, in his own
country, where the distinctions of rank are all-important.
We add the following remarks on Omai from Tin New
Zbaaandkbs, a volume published by the Society for the
Diffusion of Useful Knowledge :—
' When Captain Cook, whom he had so lone accom
panied, left him, during his last voyage, at Huaheine,
with every provision for his comfort, no earnestly begged
to return to England. It was nothing that a grant of
land was made to him at the interposition of his English
friends, — that a house was built and a garden planted for
bis use. Ho wept bitter tears; for he was naturally
afraid that his new riches would make him an object of
hatred to his countrymen. He took back many valuable
possessions and some knowledge. But he was originally
one of the common people; and ho soon saw, although
he was not sensible of It at first, that without rank he
could obtain no authority. Ho forgot this, when he wss
away from the people with whom he was to ond his days ;
but he seemed to feel that he should be insecure when
his protector, Cook, had left their shores. He divided
his presents with the chiefs; and the great navigator
threatened them with his vengeance if Oraai wss
molested. The reluctance of this man to return to hii
original condition was principally derived from these
considerations, which were to him of a strictly personal
nature. Tho picture which Cowper has drawn of the
feelings of Omai is very beautiful, and in great part true
as applied to him as an individual ; but it is not true of
tho mass of savages. The habits amidst which they are
born may be modified by an intercourse with civlliied
men, but they cannot bo eradicated.'",The Australian ,"650,798,769,850,824,608,644,646,690,665,687,680,875,762,731,628,705,746,670,669,702,674,655,759,592,768,712,704,591,761,679,720,615,879,625,681,654,590,633,550,715,742,741,497,652,781,619,693,749,684,928,843,615,919,741,690,742,637,711,638,629,538,746,691,742,628,703,662,718,766,141,916,920,957,920,921,920,921,921,920,922,922,922,926,923,924,924,924,923,923,556,887,926,926,927,923,923,922,925,921,918,918,919,918,916,916,915,915,915,915,914,913,912,912,915,910,911,605",Tue 30 Dec 1845,"288,383,416,450,483,516,548,581,614,646,679,713,745,777,810,843,875,907,941,973,1005,1039,1071,1103,1136,1167,1201,1233,1266,1296,1331,1361,1395,1426,1460,1492,1526,1556,1589,1624,1654,1688,1720,1753,1784,1815,1850,1882,1913,1948,1979,2012,2046,2079,2109,2142,2174,2208,2240,2273,2306,2339,2370,2402,2434,2467,2500,2532,2564,2596,2630,289,323,356,389,421,453,487,519,548,583,617,646,682,714,746,781,813,843,875,908,941,974,1005,1040,1071,1104,1136,1169,1201,1234,1267,1294,1331,1365,1395,1429,1461,1494,1527,1560,1591,1625,1658,1688,1723,1750,1788","433,281,281,282,282,282,282,282,282,281,281,281,282,281,280,281,281,282,283,283,282,281,281,282,283,281,282,282,283,283,284,284,284,283,284,284,283,284,284,284,284,284,285,285,286,286,286,286,285,285,285,287,287,287,286,287,286,286,286,286,286,285,288,286,285,286,287,286,286,288,1032,1267,1262,1262,1262,1262,1262,1262,1262,1263,1262,1262,1262,1262,1262,1262,1262,1262,1264,1265,1263,1301,1263,1263,1263,1264,1263,1264,1264,1264,1265,1265,1265,1265,1266,1266,1266,1267,1266,1266,1267,1268,1268,1267,1267,1268,1268,1268",37153722,Page 46

THE DROWNED COTTERS.
Oh, loud in the wet woods the June tempest
waileth,
And hoarse boom the waters where the
flooded creeks meet;
And gloomy forebodings the tiller's cheeks
paleth
As he lists to wild rain's incessant beat.
For a maze bush of creeks the valley tra
verseth,
Where, clipp'd round by ridges, his lone
lone cottage stands;
And the swift-swelling water already im
merseth
The spindling young corn-crops on the low
lying lands.
O'er the peaks of the morelands, lofty and
hoar,
Drifts the rack of the tempest, ominous and
swarth,
Whilst peals the loud thunder with resonant
roar,
As the lurid red links of the lightning leap
forth ;
The wintry woodlands for a moment illuming
With a swift-glancing brilliance transient
and pale,
Revealing the hut, in the dim distance loom
ing,
And confluent bush creeks inundating the
the vale.
Again, o'er the wind-gusts, peals heaven's
artillery--
Its echoes loud-lengthening amongst the
wet hills;
Whilst the boom of the torrent---tumult's
artillery---
With a wild thrill of terror the tiller's
breast fills
For over his threshold the waters are welling,
Submerging in their swift rise the sparse
wooded knoll,
Where, lone and secluded, stands his doomed
dwelling,
Cut off from the uplands by the torrent's
deep roll.
Higher, still higher, rise the fast-welling
waters,
Till with a hiss, like an adder, they glide
'neath the door,
And hope dies in the hearts of the doomed
cotters,
As fast deepens the deluge on the hut floor,
Swift up the wooden walls creeps the white-
seething terror,
Whilst loud lamenations the flooded hut
fills,
As, too late, the cotters bewail their sad
error
In not seeking safety on the tempest-swept
hills.
Out through the wild waters anon wade the
tillers,
To seek a brief refuge on the dusky bark
roof;
There to keep a lorn watch amid the wild
billows,
And a little while longer to hold death
aloof.
T'he red gleann of the lightning a weird scene
discloseth,
As, frequent, it lights up the storm-darken'd space
On the waters, the hut-roof, ark-like reposeth,
Burdened with bow'd forms and with white
waxen face.
Flood-drift and sticks, and the field-fruits of
autumn,
Glide down the deluge like huge avalanches,
Whilst doleful and shrill from the deep-flooded
bottom
Floats up the wild wail of the torrent-swept
branches.
Leviathan-like loometh the forms of the
cattle
(Dappling the darkness like weird shapes in
a dream),
As they glide by the watchers striving to battle
With the o'erwhelming force of the turbu
lent stream.
Slow wanes the stormy night, and the minutes
seem hours,
To the worn watchers cowering 'neath the
bleak gale ;
Still on their shivering forms the beating rain
pours,
And still roll the swift waters down the
dark vale.
But, hark ! now a wild scream is borne o'er
the waters,
On the wings of the hoarse winds of wintry
June,
As the hut, like a drunkard, waves and
totters,
Ere, prone on the waters, its frail timbers
are strewn.
Out from the stormy south, in flame-spangled
armour,
Leaps the lurid chain-lightning with space-
fluming glare,
Lighting the waters, ere they close o'er the
farmer
And his drowning spouse and their loved
nursling fair
Gleaneth the red bolt on the deluge abhorrent,
Swift followed by a darkness deep and
profound ;
Whilst mingles the tumult of thunder and
torrent
A requiem wierd o'er the manes of the
drowned.
Hushed is the tempest and red sunshine is
gleaming
On the trunnel-creased cones of the hills in
the west:
And Sol, in his calm rise, with gold bands is
is rimming
The down-clouds dim-brooding o'er the
wood's eastern crest.
The rain-drops, like tears--pearly symbols of
of sorrow
Spangle the droop'd fronds with a coruscant
sheen ;
And the woodlands seem weeping o'er the
wild horror
That broods in the valley so beautiful
yestreen.
Daggled wheat- sheaves and farm-gear litter
the flood-line--
Rimming the steep ridges that slope down
to the vale,
And the wreck of farm--fences and countless
drown'd kine
Are strewn through the valley on the flood's
oozy trail
A rude rustic chimney, built with moss
mottled rubble,
All blistered and stained by the floods and
the rain ,
And a fenceless field, filled with flood-drift
and stubble,
Of the erst-happy homestead are all that
that remain.
The flood has subsided, and down their rough
channels
The waters it the treacherous creeks slug
glishly roll,
And another dark chapter saddens our annals,
Yea! another dark chapter of horror and
and dole ;
And yonder rubble chimney that, like an old
tomb,
In the lone valley loometh where the cottage
erst stood
Long, long will remind of the drowned
settler's doom.
And be link'd with the legend of the fatal

Died, Queanbeyan, September 16th, 1872
The sexton, with his mattock keen,
Hath scoop'd another narrow bed
Beneath the spring grass, spindling green
In yonder dell where sleep our dead.
Hath scoop'd a bed in mother earth
For a village father, now at rest;
One loved for honest manly worth;
And lov'd most by those who knew bim best:
By those who, 'neath his manner brusque.
A large, warm, feeling heart had found;
Had probed beneath the seeming husk,
And proved the inner kernel sound.
A brave strong heart, brimful of love--
Aye! love for all humanity ;
An eagle's nest where dwelt a dove,
Its every plume a gen'rous sympathy
Strain'd not's my verse to suit the rhyme,
Believe me, you who scan my lyric;
Not garrulous verbiage wrote 'gainst time,
But honest; heartfelt panegyric
On one who in his humble sphere
Esteem had won by 's integrity;
Was a neighbour kind, a friend sincere,
And a sire and spouse exemplary.
A plain, straightforward son of toil,
Who ne'er was known to pander
To factions zealots, nor to soil
A neighbour's fame by slander.
Doubtless he had faults: and who has not?
Wholly perfect are but few men
The orb of day's not free from spot,
And to err, we know, is human.
The lasting fame of an honest sire
His children have for heritage;
No nobler dower could they desire;
Gold to prefer were sacrilege.
Contrasted with such honest fame
Sure, worldly wealth but trash is ;
More precious far than ought mere wealth can
claim
ls the tomb that holds his ashes.
And on that tomb may spring-blooms nod,
The daisy and wildling-bulb's meek blossom,
Whilst softest sunheams bathe the sod
That rests above his manly bosom.
And green he his mem'ry as the moss
Fann'd by balmiest spring breezes;
And may his soul, cleansed from earth's dross,
Rest everlasting find through Jesus.

TIIE CONVICT'S GRAVE.
In that far clime which England made her prison,
Soon as she took it fresh from Nature's hand,
Where yet the sun of freedom ne'er hath risen,
Nor peace-crowned Knowledge shed her influence
bland ;
There, 'mid the forests of that prison-land,
Beside a gloomy river, is a grave,
O'er which shall Grief erect no statue grand,
Nor mourner's mantle in the moonlight wave;
Yet Australasia's tombs no nobler tenants have.
And those brave limbs the felon's fetters wore,
Though 'twas a glorious heart which them sus-
tain'd,
Ev'n by its adverse fate ennobled more
Than if in peace it had unscath'd remain'd;
And he, with lofty character unstain'd,
Was banish'd from his home of sweet content
Because he loved his country, and had trained
Th' expansive growth of that high sentiment —
To cling round Freedom's feet — immovable, unbent!
The desert's depth received him as the vile;
Th' inhuman task, the brutal torture, came;
Still weeps he not where tyrants dare not smile,
Invincible in soul, though crush'd in frame —
Through all his desperate calmness is the same !
He thought of home, but he could bear to think;
He felt his doom was seal'd, but freedom's flame
Glow'd in th' o'er-burdened heart, which would
not sink;
As if such breast could ev'n outwear oppression's
link.
To lift the maul, to excavate the rock,
With penal irons pinching the weak limb —
To eat the bread, which seem'd as given to mock
The wants of nature — giv'n with look so grim!
This was the punishment awarded him,
To tame his insubordinate soul, they said;
And, when the light within his eyes grew dim,
They coldly deem'd his pride of spirit fled,
Nor question'd of the change, till one exclaimed
"" He's dead !""
Oh, 'tis most merciful the worn heart breaks,
To liberate the soul, and baffle crime:
This, surely, was ordain'd for exiles' sakes,
Who droop and wither in a foreign clime !
Nor this the first, nor the first hundredth time,
The convict in Australia so hath ended
A life, despite surrounding ills, sublime
In truth and fortitude — unwept, unfriended.
This sad tale is but one might be with others blended.
But yesterday they flogged him at the tree,
And deem'd he suffer'd lightly 'neath the lash ;
To-day they bury him as heartlessly,
And on his corse the cold earth rudely dash.
'Tis night again, and the broad lightning's flash,
With a wild loveliness, plays o'er his grave;
And breaks the tempest, with terrific crash,
Through the dark forest ; but the storm may rave,
The dead would sleep though it tore up the dead
man's cave !
The parrots cull the stringy-bark's young blossom
There, on bright painted wings, through summer's
day,
And in the moonlit gum-tree freaks th' opossum,
O'er that lone sepulchre, in nightly play;
But no true heart shall nature's tribute pay,
The melancholy spot to consecrate.
Long years, to swell grief's sum, shall roll away
Ere man's commotion change its rugged state,
Or make it social seem, or mark it desolate!
And young blue eyes, 'mid Erin's blighted bowers,
With tears of mourning for his sake, grow dim:
One heart, which feasted on the breath of flowers,
And drank the wild bird's melody with him,
When, if ought ruffled joy, 'twas but some whim
Of love's first fondness — one adoring heart,
Is still all his, and, ev'n were seraphim
To woo it from his memory, would not part!
O, woman, in thy love, how wonderful thou art!

main point. If grading is done «t the right ttm°,

seaton, the most 'ngcnioiirlj eon-trtict el instrumo'it,
¡.nd with an eeige as sharp ns th/itof a razor, will not
cn»ure success, anti more especially in the case of th<>
tine». Many ycais ago, Mr. Braddick, i.f Thurn?«
Dittoi», generally failed in grafting th» vine at t>ic
ui-unl time of grattir-g in spring. Iii», however, re-
ce it ed some vine cutting* fnm abroad, in
i st inn,cr, nf'.er his vinca weie in full lea""',
mid, anxious to ptescrve the sort-, and far thj
M^ku of experiment, he then grafeed tiem
ti ough tlmost hopeless of success ,' but as it
tumi d out, to his surprise, the greft* took well. Hy
i-ubsequcnt ixperimonts, the- rc»ults of which he com-
munie atcd to the Horticultural Soci-ty, ho established
ti e fact that vines ought not to he"" grafted till t\c
Bti ck on v. biih ihe scion is placsel is in leaf. Most
probably, thmfore, M. Boissel- t's complete failure,
with the vine at least, hu9 occurred, like that of many
otlur8, in louscqutnce of ginftin¡r, at a season when
the plant ought iiot to he cut on tiny account whatever,
that is, after the sap_ is io motinn, anil before the buns
u\ya\ el. Any incision made duritg that peiiid per.
»nit» the vine to bleed, but most pmfu-ely if mude just
lu f re the hudu open ; and the more \ g »ions the vine,
the -werae- the blteding. When l»rgo limbs of apple
and enher trees are cut and grufteet just as they are
on the point of bursting into le if, the flow of sap is
oft ii so gteat a» to ""drown the grii'-,"" as sulfu-ion
furn the ovuilov. of sap is technically termed. But
the loss of the graft is not the only had conse-
quence of the untniely t.p rition. The unab
to.hed extrf.tasated mp ferments, btcimes putrid
or tie-id, and kills the vital t.sbue l>ing
between the alburnum and inner balk. The stuck
coiisceiueiitly oies back to a greater or le-s distance
bilov. the» wound, inste-nd of keeping alite or healing
o\cr, as \>otilti be the case if cutback in autumn, tr
winter. Many ptrsuns complain that their pears on
quinte stocks do nut succeed well. Tue) should re
tollt i-t that the quince i-¡ amongat the earliest of deci-
duous trees in coming into leaf, and therefore ¡tshould
be be neicd baik for grafting curly in the year ¡it 1 ttest ;
fir \>hen e'oiie nttho time of grafting or after its sap
is in iictiv- flow, it dies or cankers nt the graitotl part,
sn that a pe-ifect union cannot possibly take place.
Prif-umirg tnat due ttttentirn is piid t> the proper
lime of grafting, ihe operuti n may b» succc-sfutly
peifwmtd in various ways. On the whole we con-
sider that in most casts whip-grnfiing is the morn pre-
ferable; snd what is termed in the fievue Horticole,
Dniiiel Ilooibieik's system, appear-« to bo nothing
more liev hss then tv nip grafting. It is better than
clti't-groftii g, bemuse more of the sections of
the itit.tr burks of tho stock and reim
cm he nade to coincide than by other moles.
M Cniiicrr, who is a very înt-lligent hor'iculturist,
slttuil- n Csse in tvhit-h Ilcoibicnk's modi», or »hat
wo may as well call whip-gr»ftii.g, succeeded better
ti an cltft-giRfting. In the bcn'iniiin^ ot"" September,
be took tu o tine shoots, of whioh the wood weis the i
half-hcihacccus. One he cut in length-, of five inches
or six inches, each piece being cut immediately undtr
u butl tit its buse, ard close above one nt it-, top, exsctl y
us if prepared for a cuttuur, but a slice at top wa¡
taken off ss in whip, piafting to receive the scion
fomied of a portion rf the other shoo*, which latter
was cut so ps to iirefeerve a bud and leaf at its top,
whilht it1- base was cut sloping to fit exactly it« coun-
terpart at the top of the other piece intended for the
stock. The patts wura then litd, and covered with
giafi'ng wax. Each grafted cutting or cutting stock
te as then inserted about half ¡ti length in a put, and
placed under a hand or bell glass in a propai-atiiig
bouse. The leaf ul the top of the fcion continued to
nut, and contributed to the formation ot roo's, and the
union of the tarait. This mode is not much required
for piopngaiing the vine, beesuse it can he so r,-adily
struck horn eyes ; yet it mutht be usefully employed
where it is desit able that any particular sort i-h mid ho
lint upon a vigorous stock, such as the Black Ham-
burgh, There are, how evir, many other plants f r the

advantageously adopted,-Gardener's Chronicle.

place the AmtiicBu fabric. Neurly all these, how-
ever, were too much like the Transatlantic atticlo to
be perfectly successful. ""With its merits, they repro-
duce d its grave defects-the liability of the varnish to
crock, the epicure to fade, and the material itself to
weal out fast as comiW«] wi'h real lei'her. One
sears of specimens, ùuWeVCr, in this class attraotçl a
great desl of ntlention, though the-y failed io attract a
medal. These specimens Wfre shown by Mr.
Sztrelmey, a gentleman well known for hi* most

ard paper, and up to the presant time the moat cuc

has since then grown in reputation till it now
promises to become a most important manufacturing
d'îeotery, since, while the cloth thus prepared
possess»""s all the best attributes of leather in crcat
strength and durability, it has other and special ad
vantsges of its own, which even tbe advocates of the
famous vii tues of leather have never claimed for it
namely, complete impermeability to water, a flexi-
bility and softness equal to a woollen fabric, and a
chitipntss which-makes i's cist one-third that of real
leather. Thus, a good calf-skin costs from 10s. to
14f., and yield9 leather for three or three find a hilf
pairs of buots, whereas six square feet of the calfskin
lea'her cloth yields materials for five or six prirs of
boots, and costs only shout 4s. Gd. Such an im
poitant diffctence snd saving as this ought to satisfy
ai,y inventor; but even more than this is chimed
for the ""pannonia"" in its capability of being produced
in any quantity at a fow days' notice, and in sizes
only limited to the size to -which the fabric can be
w oven on which the composition is laid. The nucleus
of a factory has been ettablished at Clapham, where
the leather is now made, »nd were a company is about
to coi struct large works and carry on the manufac-
ture on the most extmsive scale. The fabric used in
the manufacture ia entirely according to the kimi of
imitation Irathir wished to be turned out. Thus
"" moll""--a terv thiik, soft kind of cotton fabric made
at Manchester-is prefirreá for calf-skin i fine calico
or linpn fer -waterproof matsiial for macintoshes,
siphonias, &c, as perfectly waterproof as indiarubber
itself; ,and alpsca, silk, cloth, or common cotton
for boots and shoes, bookbindings, harness, carriage
furniture, and all the thousand purposes to
wh ch real leather is spplisd. ""What the com-
position of the pigment is which in a few hours
changes cemmon cotton into a substance like enamelled
leather, and only to be» distinguished from the real
aiticle by its non-liability to crack and its greatly
additios al strength, is of course a strict trade secret.
The node of manufacture, however, is simple. The
fabric tobe converted intor leather, silk, alp to, or
wfc at ever it may be, of any length or width, is merely
wound on roller« beneath a broad knife-blade, which
by its weight presses in and equally fdi-itributes the
pigment previously placed upon »f. A hundred yards
may thus be dono in a bingle.minute, and in this most
simple application tho whale mtuuU'ac ure begins Mid

THE DREAM BY THE FOUNTAIN.
3Tbongbt-weaey and sad I reclined by a fonltain,
The head of a white-cederhsbaded ravine;
And the brceze that fell over the high.glooning mountain,
Sang to me, like love, os I gazed on theu scene.
Long I'd reclined not till slumber came o'er me,
Orateful es death to a suifering child;
Whren a ioty.aouled maiden eeemed standing before me,
With a lyre in her hand-ch, so sounding and wild!
Bright was her brow, never heaven was brighter;
le eyes were two midnights of passionate thought;
Light were her movements, a zephyr not lighter;
And her locks were ihe tunhine ad hadow inweught.
Never before did my bosom inherit
Emotion so thrilling-such passionate awea
Never such wonder exalted my spirit
Before, as did now through the vision I saw I
Then lifting the lyre, and with every feeling
Sublimed as withjoy, she awakened the strings:
Bliss followed-and half into being camo stealling
The motion and light of angelical wings.
Divine were the numbers! Each votce of the wild-wood
Seemed gathering head in their musical thrills
The gloadness of rivers that sitg of their childhood,
The shouting of echoes that look from the hills;
The moaning of trees in the moonlight's reflection,
When the breezes seem wandering lost in the air;
With a sweet meaning spirit of human afectlican,
All blending and woven together were there.
Ceased then the strain-and as soon as were flowing
Around but the accenlts that people the wild,
The lyrist, subdued by her rupture, and glowing,
Adjasted her mantle, approached me, and smiled.
And repressing it seemed now the fondest suggestions,
Calmly sheo sirke ;-l arose to my knees,
Expectaot and fearfully glad of her questions:
And the wild-warbled words that she uttered were these.
"" I am the muse of tho evergreen forest,
I am the spouse of thy asirit, lone tard;
Thee, from the days when thy boyhood thou worest,
Won in thy pastimes my fondest regard.
"" Thee even then I felt wondrously mnusing
Of glory and grace, by old Hawkcsbu-y es side;
Scenes that spreod rerordleas round thee suffusing
Wit thb purplo of love-I beheld and seghd:
0 Sighed-for the tfire-robe of thought had enwound thee,
It seemed but tihe breeze, or a sound of thine own I
I would sweep then this lyre, gliding viewless around thee,
To give to thy feelings a measure and tone.
""Slate I have tracked thee through dissolute places;
Saw thee, with sorromw, long herd with the vain;
Lured Into error by filse-smiling faces -
Chained by dull fashion, yet scorning the chain.
""Then would I prompt it the still hour of dreaming,
Thought of the beautiful country agen;
Of streamsl tlnrough the shadowy forest far glefuing
Of mountains that echo the hunt in tho glen,
"" Till at length I beheld thee arise in devotion,
And shake from thy heart the vile bondage it borse:
Andjoyed, at in sunrise rejoiceth the ocean,
Ihy footfaito bear in the mountlains once more.
"" Listen, redeemed one: I promise thee glory,
Such as shall rilse like the day.altarapart,
To brighlen the current of many a story
But for this thou must give to ie futurem thy heart,
""Be, then, abard of thy country Oh, ratter
Should such ha thy choic thuan a motanrchy wide I
Lo,'tis the land of the grave of thy fatherl!
'Tie the cradle of liberty 1-Think, and decide.
"" Well hast thou chosen I"" She ceased. Utnreyplag,
Mutely.I gazed on her wildering charms:
Deeper they glowed; her lips trembled, and, sighing,
She rushed to my heart, and dissolved in my arms.
Thus seemed she to pass-and yet somollting remaining,
Like aseparate soul, in my soul seemed to be;
An aching delight-an coaextension, that palulug
My spirit, yet made It more strengthy and free.
She passed-but to leave in.amy.brain such sweet madness -
Assurances strange of prophetical sway!
While sounds that seem gushings of mystical glaenens,
Flow through me by night and around me by day.
And since, or in cties, 'or solitudes dreary
Upon the lone hill, or as lonely sea sans,
Though many that blame, few that iraiso be asear me,

TO THE SISTERS OF CHARITY.
As dews from heaven refresh the earth,
Dispelling blights which menace death;
Disease and want thy presence flee,
Angelic maids of Charity.
Call'd from thy slumbers sweet, ere day,
In mantles rob'd of solemn grey,
To cheer the sons of misery,
With thy sweet balm of Charity.
The pining widow's mourning wail,
The infant orphan's artless tale,
Are soothed and tranquilized by thee,
Celestial maids of Charity.
Sever'd by choice, from friends and home;
From stately halls and guilded dome;
From dance and song and revelry,
To pour out heaven's own Charity.
Inhaling o'er the bed of death,
The tainted breeze, and fetid breath;
Guiding the imprison'd soul set free,
To heaven's bright throne of Charity.
Pouring the balm of sweet devotion,
On hearts long troubled with emotion;
Comforting with hope the broken hearted,
From whom the grace of God departed.
Pursue thy course now heav'nward bent,
Instructing many to repeat,
Till when this vale of woe you leave,
Eternal mansions ye receive.

You have the strange lost loveliness
of dreams,
Dreams unfulfilled, that legacy of-
worlds
Of golden light we have left far be-
hind;
You break the siver grey of Bris-
bane town
With your wild flame, like some rare
smile of youth
Upon a face old and grooved with
time;
And on the winding road to Tam-
bourine
You make bouquet for some bronzed
winter bride,
Fragrant and delicate, and full of
hope
In the eternity of bridegroom's
love!
Oh! Wattle! You are Queensland's
sweetest song;
No matter how our poets chirp or
trill,
Voiceless, you speak with many
golden tongues,
And, inarticulate you yet can chant
A triumph that writes Joy along the
bush;
The sombre gums look mildly down
on you,
A laughing child these elders guard
and love,
The envious bottle brush has tried so
long
To rival you on many rivers ways,
Flaunting her ardent blues by sliding
streams,
Whose greens reflect the scarlets of
her rouge-
But you, Oh golden face, packed full
of charm,
You are the Queen of all the country-
side;
Blowing your essences on every
wind,
Tossing loose blossoms, to make a
powder puff
For little argent fairies capped with
green,
Breaking, like courage, thro' the
darkest wood,
Paying your yellow coin to the
brown purse
Of earth, and asking nothing in re-
turn,
Till, like the pagan men of old, we come
Finding God in a flower, to worship
you!

Verses occasioned by the death of a child of the meazles.
And art thou gone ? so early gone ?
But yesterday and thou wer't fresh,
As is the breeze the mountains on,
Or verdure by the fountain's gush ;
A day is past and thou art found,
A fragment of the burial ground.
Say, for what purpose cam'st thou here,
To what did tend thy short-lived bloom,
Were't but to exact from love the tear,
And swell the trophies of the tomb ;
Or like a tint of closing day,
A gawde to smile itself away ?
Perchance Heaven look'd and saw thy trace
Of destiny ; to prove to go
'Mid the black waters of disgrace,
Or thorney wilderness of woe ;
Then pitying snatch'd thee to the skies,
At least thou'st found in death's repose,
A shelter from the future storm ;
The hands which crush the op'ning rose,
Destroy as well the 'gend'ring worm ;
And give it triumph o'er the night,
Of strengthening heat and gathering blight.

HIS WIFE IN ENGLAND.
(The following pathetic verses on their appearance
in certain of the London Prints, produced extraor-
dinary interest in the breasts of every sympathising Englishman. We copy them verbatim. They need no comment. Nor need we offer any.)
Farewell, hapless Mary!—your Joseph no more
To his home shall return from this barbarous shore,
By tyranny goaded,
With slave-irons loaded,
His soul, tho' still yearning with fondness for thee,
From oppression, indignantly pants to be free.
O! cursed be the day, when my freedom I sold,
Nor deem'd British Soldiers as Helot's enroll'd;
In want, unassisted,
I rashly enlisted,
To give bread to my Mary and how I was led,
But ah! freedom and life I then barter'd for bread!
For wr0ngs upon wrongs I was forced to endure,
With which pow'r and wealth goad the weak, and
the poor;
While my proud spirit rising,
Tho' hardships despising,
Spurn'd blows, and abuse; and reflecting on thee,
Resolved-----or to die, or from slavery be free!
But alas! vain the attempt, which I hoped would succeed,
My Mary I fear you will blush for the deed,
A deed my heart scorning,
Hope blindly suborning;
Hope delusive, that prompted an act I abhorr'd,
Yet feign'd I should then be to Mary restored.
Oh! no—tho' my name was ne'er sullied by theft;
Yet of freedom, of peace, and my Mary bereft;
A martyr to feeling,
A feint of base stealing
I fatally made,—my escape to effect
From a service, in which all my bliss had been
wreck'd!
But frustrate that hope! tho' my motives were
known,
Tho' acknowledged of crime 'twas the semblance
alone,
As a felon convicted,
To a dungeon restricted,
While slave-irons my limbs in dire torture controul,
O Mary! ''the iron enters into my soul.""
Could my agonised body, and feelings allow,
No means of repose my vile fetters bestow;
Sharp spikes the prevention,
No power of extension,
The links which my neck with my legs firmly bind,
Permit my poor limbs, cramp'd in torture to find!
Oh my country! for mercy, and valour renowned:
Shall thus your defenders with slave-irons be bound?
Shall your laws, framed by justice,
When t---------'s lust is,
By l------es inflictions add torment to pains,
Nor your sons, but by death, evade c-----ty's chains?
Oh no! in that land, where true freedom resides,
Where justice, but temper'd with mercy, presides;
When my sufferings are stated,
My sad fate related,
Her pitying voice will atonement demand,
For a son, thus des-----ed in a barbarous land!
Yes! my spirit from prison that longs to be freed
In futurity's page! retribution can read;
When the Senate of Britain
In judgment shall sit on,
The merciless sentence that sinks me to dust,
And condemn the o*p-----r, ""for Britain is just.""
* * * * * *
Farewell! hapless Mary! your husband is lying,
In a dungeon, in chains, in a far country dying;
Yet while his pulse flutters.
He one behest utters,
""O ne'er for a soldier encourage our boy,
Or like mine, future G-----s his life may destroy.""

Can you by your method make i

Exists for want of mentor.

And the doleful dumps depress,
Sweet music with ber silver sound
Should Und you always redress.'

How touch more then should not ye ?

A piano there should be.

The Undertaker's Horse.
Maybe I'm not much to look at,
I'm played out, and broken down, too ;
I've a bit of condition for all that.
And mv blood is the bluest of blue.
My sire was Julian by Ajax.
Whose colour I have and his pace ;
My dam was Aurora by Syntax
Who never was beat in a race.
So you'll see that my pedigree's light,
Although I'm dragging a hearse ;
B- the Lord if my coat had been white,
I might have been doing much worse ;
I remember the day of the sale —
They talked of the races I'd won,
Huw, when wanted, I never did fall.
Haw gamely I had always *on.
Well, there wasn't a bid in the crowd,
The auctioneer said ' Pass him in,'
When a feedy old cove said out loud :
' I'il give you a quid for his skin ;'
They took it, then he led me away— .
I was weary, and didn't care where ;
I'd been in the sun all the day.
And been about heie and there.
When I reached this cove's stables at last,
I saw all the horse's were black ;'
Then my ' innards' recalled my long list,
' So I went for the hay in tbe rack.
My new boss was an undertaker —
A lean, lank and spber old cove.
Who looked all the world like a Quaker,
Who'd just slept the night in a stove.
Well, I must say he's been good to me.
And I can't say I don't like my place ;
It's just what suits me to a T —
This good old funeral pace. -
Thoupli I oft think how many would laugh,
Who knew roe in in/ prime,
And tbe distance— a mile and a half —
I did in the shortest of time.
I'd have liked to-been there in a hearse,
With a light weight catpse in the van,
How the skinny old Quaker would cur.-e
As I rattled him round on the tan ;
?Well, I've no right to grumble, not I,
For were I not black as (he fogs,
Were I chestnut or roan, or a pie,
I'd surely have g«ne to the doqs.
An-J now I'm thankful I arp black,
You'll agree that it would have been worse,
To be used as a butcher boy's hack,
Than sedately to walk in a hearse.
Thei's no cheering now in the straight ;
But I'm not going to give up the ghost,
.1*11 carry ihe ' stiffs,' just as straight,
As I cartied them borne from tbe post.

May Kidson.
A sunbeam sparkled in my soul,
And flashed its sweet surprise
From tender blue of flower-hearts —
That we call Baby's eyes.
A moonbeam played at hide and seek
With silken meshes there,
And kisses left of shining gold —
We call them Baby's hair.
A broad highway I saw below,
Where perfect arches twain
Shall sentinel the secret shrine
That we call Baby's brain.
A pink shell oped its faery lid
And lo! I saw beneath
A tiny row of pearls was strung —
We call them Baby's teeth.
There's one unfinished saucy bit,
Imperfect — but it grows
A little mould of character —
That we call Baby's nose.
The roses ripened petals shed
That dimple as I speak,
Or gather them in kisses, rapt
Upon my Baby's cheek.
Just six months old and wonder wise
She sits upright and tries
To stand: and springs upon my knee
With laughter in her eyes.
The clouds shall spill their weight of tears
As a day hurries by,
And we interpret then, each note
Hid in a Baby's cry.
Rosebuds have taken now to earth
A tiptoe now in rose,
And as they trip into my heart —
I call them Baby's toes.
I feel close tendrils round my soul,
Crushed sweetness on my lips,
And in the silver dawn I spy
My Baby's finger tips.
I saw the soul peep out in her,
To rest a little while,
Upon our earth — still angel-sweet —
We call it Baby's smile.
The suns light up a shadowed world —

COME day 111 write a lovely little
*^ song
Of all the joyous things my heart
has known,
A rippling melody, not over-long
Oh what a nuisance! There's the
telephone
Where was I? Oh, this song that I
shall sing
Will mt with laughter that Is gay
and rare.
Its cadences with life and joy will
ring
I think I hear the baker on the
stair. ..
Each note will be so tender and- so
gay,
Soft as rose-petals or the touch of
silk.
-I hear a loving voice beside me say,
""Put that aside and have a glass of
milk.""
Each phrase will worship Beauty, set
apart.
-Here comes a friend. I fear she
means to stay!
Oh, little song that croons within my
heart,
I'll write you down on paper, dear,
some dayl

THE COMING OF SYMPATHY.
Old Adam,' dying, in the eveling sun,
Prayed for a rose. An angel brought him
one;
And as upon his nostrils fell its spice
The ling'ring essence of lost Paradise
A sun-shower of quick tears bedewed his
eyes;
The calloused scales of barren enterprise
Sloughed from his hands; the doubled
thews unbent;
The wearied brain stirredin its tenement
And fumed anew; the torbid heart
awoke,
And pumped rich torrents in each quic
kening stroke;
Lured from the past, a youthful spirit
came,
And lent new vigour to the palsied frame.
""Lo,"" spake old Adam, ""Is the Curse
inert P
And hath the Lord relented, that this
dirt
Of mine freshens again to bloom, and
death
Becomes a threat, to vanish in a breath P""
""Nay,"" said the angel, ""for the Lord's
decree
Fixed and immutable must ever be;
Yet, in ,His wondrous mercy and His
grace.
Of His great love He sends a fragrant
trace;
And whoso wears upon his heart this
flower
Shall sweeten sorrow in the direst hour;
Peace to the troubled give, rest to the
worn,
Joy to the dull, and kith to the forlorn.""
'TPraise.to the Lord!"" cried Adam, ""Who
hath freed
From woe my children's children and
their seed.
Whenithe swift venoms of our enemy
Strike at the core of being, there shall be
The soft ambrosial virtue of this charm
To blunt the sting and break the blow of
harm.
The imps of mischief and their fertile
broods,
That strew with spitethe passage of our
moods.
And set the teeth of discord, now shall
fade,
Like mellowed wheat before the reaper's
blade;
And the grey vampire, Fear, that drains
the heart
Of ruddy' hdpe, shall sheath his poignant
dart.""
Gently'the angel eyed him, and, then
spoke :
""The gift is but a blossom on the yoke,
A gilding on the chain, that man must
bear
Till the great sin be purged, and every
where
His Word, unlipped, shall rule. The
pains of birth
Unceasingly cast travail on the earth;
The straining tides toss to the fretted
shore
A daily message of their toil; the four
Great porters at the corners of the world
Slip frantic breathings, lest the clouds be
furled;
And man must learn, ere these new
things'be done,
Only through suffering may the prize be
won.""

% Parliament.
I
HAVEN'T read the doings
Up in the House of Jaw,
Where men of Wisdom gather
To make or unmake law.
I know this much already
What Forgan Smith will say,
What Mr. Pease will utter
To-morrow or to-day.
I know what Mr. Pollock
Is certain to orate
On any given matter
At any given date,
Be sure the Opposition
Is striking attitudes,
With plenty table thumping
And dreary platitudes.
There will be ample common
Or garden kind of plots.
That mostly end in nothing
Yes, lots of 'em, and lots.
Whatever else may happen
One thing there will not be
One feature will be lacking
Originality.
Sir Otto.
QIR OTTO arrives in Brisbane by
° mail train.
At the end of each section of the
line he asks his secretary: ""What in-
terest is this returning?""
And replies, ""Humph!""
He asks, also, if the engines and
rolling stock are repaired out of
revenue or loan?
""Loan, Sir Otto.""
""Humph!""
Sir Otto avoids the reception com-
mittee and gets out unostentatiously
at Roma-street.
In the morning he rises early and
takes a stroll round.
At breakfast he asks his secretary
how was the Town Hall built?
""Loan money, Sir Otto.""
""Any return?""
""Very little.""
""Sewerage, electric light, and trams?""
""Loan money!""
""Interest?""
No, Sir Otto.""
Disguised as a workman he attends
a council meeting.
After listening a while he grunts:
""Humph! No wonder!"" and retires.
Good Example.
""¡ITR. FENTON, Minister for Trade
-""A and Customs, has refunded Í100
of his expenses to the Commonwealth
revenue.-News item.
Cheerful news that Mr. Fenton
Is apparently intent on
Balancing the revenue,
He refuses to annex his
Hundred pounds or so of exs..
Given as his rightful due.
Worthy anyhow of mention,
Such magnanimous intention
Nowadays,
Merits praise,
And suggests that such a sample
Is a very good example
That can do with imitation,
In an overgoverned nation.
Rising.
rpHERE is no more disguising
x The fact that it's rising
But not as the tide
That lifts to subside ,
Nor yet as the wage they name as the
basic
That rose overnight and now is to-
day sick.
Yes, truly it's rising,
There is no use disguising
The fact that it certainly is
Not rising like fiz
With a splash and a shower
At the banqueting hour.
Relentlessly merciless
A stage higher passes
Brimwards anear
The bottom in glasses
Of beer.
Ultra Canny.
T-TE was an ultra canny Scot selector,
and had employed a new hand. On
the first morning he aroused the fel-
low by lantern light at three o'clock, and
took him down into the iield, where
they wrought till 8 p.m. Next morning,
ditto.
On the third morning he concluded
that the man should now Know his
duty. He, therefore, went down alone.
At daylight the hand turned up.
""And so you've come along at last,""
said Sandy. ""What I'd like to know Is
where have you been all this fore-
noon?""
An Expert.
rpHAT was an apt and shrewd reply
given by a Border Irishman in
giving evidence in a banana case be-
fore the Civil Court down there.
He kept using the word ""Expert.""
The judge asked him to explain ex-
actly what he meant by the term.
""Well, your Honour,"" he said, ""an
expert is the fellow who holds the
job!""
Finance.
""you may say what you will of
-*? Finance,
It is evident now at a glance
That, whatever the vote is,
We have got to take notice
When Finance instructs us to dance.
For the tunes that he cares to supply,
Be we lowly or wealthy or high,
It is Finance that rules
Over wise men and fools
With a mandate they dare not deny.
When the bondsman is making bad
weather,
Or is reaching the end of his tether,
It is Finance denies him
Or further supplies him
To fly with-the much-needed feather.
Goombungee Railway.
npHE Goombungee railway was the
x burning question among his elec-
tors when the late W. Thorn repre-
sented the Aubigny, and there were no
greater advocates of the member and
the line than the many sons of Erin
in that electorate.
There was one sturdy old Irishman
in particular who never missed a poli-
tical meeting. He carried a heavy
blackthorn stick, and was ever ready
for action.
One night a man got up in front of
him in the hall and asked the mem-
ber why he didn't get them the rail-
way.
Before he could get an answer the
blackthorn descended heavily on his
head and the subsequent proceedings
failed to interest him.
Then the wielder of the stick rose up
and fiercely faced the audience: ""Is
there any one else here that wanta to
ask a question,"" he roared ?
There wasn't.
Narrow Escape.
A CCOMPANIED by her husband, a
reputable Brisbane lady entered a
draper's shop to make a purchase. She
carried a parcel, which she laid down
while -the husband fitted on a blazer.
Completing the purchase she picked
up her parcel, and was about to leave
the store when she was stopped at
the door and asked to accompany the
shopwalker to the office. After some
demur she did so.
When the parcel was opened in the
office it was found to contain a dozen
ladies' singlets, the shop property.
Naturally there was consternation.
In the midst of it a shopwalker arrived
with another, woman, whom he had
caught pilfering.
When the second parcel was opened

A HUNTING SONG.
Hurrah for the bright and smiling morn,
With the earth refreshing dew,
And hurrah ! for the bush and the grassy plain,
And hurrah !---for the ""Kangaroo !""
The steeds are mounted, the dogs are free,
And the station buildings past;
Hurrah ! for the fresh inspiring wind,
And the horse that gallops fast !
Away on the plain 'neath the distant range,
Where the grass is sweet and new,
Lies our quarry to-day,--now "" Away ! away !
'Tis the Old Man Kangaroo ! ""
For their very lives flee his frightened wives,
All the points of the compass round;
Away they've sped, with instinctive dread
Of the fangs of the savage hound.
Through branching trees we fly with ease,
And the straining dogs in view ;
With bound on bound o'er the level ground
Goes the ""Old Man Kangaroo.""
O'er hollow and stones, and the mouldering bones
Of many a mighty tree;
As we follow the dogs we leap the logs
With a cheer, in our sporting glee.
And now we creep down the bank so steep
Of the dried up water-course,
O'er its sandy bed,--up the side we're led,
Nor curb the excited horse.
Now vith dogs a pair, so lean and spare,
The run will be short and hard ;
For he'll stand at bail on his mighty tail,
And boldly he'll fence and guard.
But see ! now see, 'neath the big gum tree
At bay he stands at last;
With a final bound each anxious hound
Is panting and gripping fast.
On he ground he lies, and his starting eyes
Are filled with a deadly pain
'Neath the grinding jaw, while each mighty claw
Is striking the air in vain.
Down ""Darkie's"" side flows a ruddy tide,
And his throat is red and dank;
Nor does ""Nigger "" feel, with his nerves of steel,
That wound on his steaming flank.
But the glittering knife lets flow the life,
And still lies the noble prey,
Never again on the grassy plain
To welcome the light of day.
So hurrah ! for sport of whatever sort,
Eye steady, hand firm, heart true ;
Hurrah for the horse, for the dog and the course,
And the ""Old Man Kangaroo.""

THE FIRST EMIGRANT SHIP.
'Twas evening—and the sun had sunk beyond the ocean wave,
Whose azure rippling waters Australia's white sands lave;
But the light still lingered in the sky, as if it sorrowed to
give place
To dark-robed night, that onward strode, with sad and
solemn pace.
To the west the sky was overspread with a tint of roseate
hue;
To the east the silver stars were bright in a vault of the
deepest blue;
The foliage of the stately gum was swayed by the summer
breeze,
And the mournful cry of the curlew came from the fragrant
wattle trees.
Upon that lonely shore a single figure stands, With the deadly boomerang and long spear in his hands.
His skin was black, and a scarlet band around his head was bound,
And from his shoulders an opossum rug hung trailing on the
ground.
His form was tall, and his large dark eyes were fixed in a
steady gaze
Upon the outline of a ship seen dimly through the haze;
While crouching down beside him on the seaweed were two
hounds,
Who helped to chase the kangaroo with wide and agile bounds.
Oh! who can tell the strange wild thoughts that swelled
within his breast,
As he watched that unknown shadowy shape upon the
ocean's crest;
While the sound of distant music come floating to the ear,
And faintly o'er the echoing waves was borne a British
cheer.
Though sunk in the lowest depths of vice, and doubly dyed with sin,
Who, who, shall say no seeds of goodness were found
within?
Perchance he loved his country; methinks none would be found
Who did not love the place where his feet first trod the
ground.
Did he see the mountain ranges where so long he'd idly roamed,
And the lordly sheeted Murray where the sparkling cascade
formed?
Did he see them given to the white man-his tribe grow few
and small
As these strangers with still stranger arts lorded it over
all?
Did he see the noble forests cut down in their strength and
pride,
And from their smoking ashes fair smiling homesteads
rise?
Did he see the flocks and herds where the emu built her
nest;
And waving golden grain upon the mountain's crest?
And did he see the vice that followed in their rear—
The deadly sin of drunkenness upon his blood-stained bier,
That fiends in human form would give the cup to him to
drain;
That would sink him deeper in the gulf, and prove his direst
bane?
And rising above all, did he see the heaven-born light
That would show the loathsome forms of sin, and pierce his
nation's night.
When the morning brightly broke the black had gone his
way,
And the stately ship with flowing sails stood in for Holdfast
Bay.
And when the blue waves leaving, that brave pioneer band,
With hearts rejoiced and thankful, leaped on the whitened
sand,
They blessed and praised His guiding hand who brought them without failure
To the fruitful hills and valleys and broad plains of Aus-
tralia.

On Friday a deputation from the Aborigines
Friends' Association waited upon His Excellency and
presented an address to him, asking that an enquiry

An adjourned meeting of the New Cornwall
Mining Company took place at the Masonic Hall,
Eng WfllianTOtreet, on the 13th instant. There
waf a yerygood attendance. After the minutes of
the last meeting bad been confirmed, the report of
the Committee appointed to consider the articles of
asaomtion was read as follows:—v Yoor Committee
hare to report that, in porso&noe of the resolution
passed at the meeting of the sth January, they have,
m conjugation with the Provisional Committee,
carefully considered the draft memorandum and
articles of association; and that, having made certain
alterations and additions, they now recommend
. them for .' adoption :by this TWAaHpg. Your
Committee have adopted your recommenda
tion, and. have ordered a number of copies
to be printed {or the use of the shareholders.""
In^newer'to Mr. J. M. Solomon, Mr. Bruce said
that the necessary steps had been taken aa to disso
lution of the old company, and that the deed of
aettlCTfflit of the new company, was quite regular.
Very many alterations aad amendments were made
in- the eonstitntipn of the company which caused a
great amount of discussion. Eight of the members
were proposed for the. office of directors, and out of
that number the fire following were declared duly
elected:—Messrs. Luxmoore, Whyte, Giyde, Acraman,
and C. B. Young. Mr. Solomon protested against
the election of Mr. .Amwnan, and the voting and
nomination of Mr. Cnllen, as neither of their names
appeared on the original agreement as
holders of shares. Mr. Brace stated that in his
opinion the election of the Directors ought to be ad
journed, but the nomination and Toting of the gentle
men he did not think would make any material diffe
rence, and he did not think any further action would be
taken in the matter, as it was not yet brought under
the Companies' Act. The following resolutions were
proposed and carried:—""That all the clauses (ex*
cept Hos. 22 and 43) as read and amended, be now
.passed; and that the solicitors of the Company
take sneh steps aa are necessary to place tins Com
pany under the Act No. 13 of 1864;"" and "" That
this meeting adjourn to Tuesday, at 2 o'clock p.m.,
for the purpose of nominating and electing Directors
and Auditors, and for adopting the articles of the
Association."" The meeting then terminated.
A general meeting of the Drapers 1 Assistants
Association was held at the Norfolk Arms, Rundle
atreet, on Friday, January 13th, Mr. W. H. Tito in
the chair. It was proposed and seconded, ""that it is
' Oe opinion of the mpeting that further steps betaken
is the early closing movement."" An amendment was
proposed and carried, ""that it is the opinion of this
meeting that the early dosing movement be left to
the Committee."" A vote of thanks to the press and
the chairman dosed the meeting.
We have received a copy of Mr. Boothby'a Book

and so highly appreciated that recommendation is
superfluous and criticism almost misplaced. It is a
bulky Tolnme, fall from cover to cover of useful in
formation to an classes of colonists, whether living in
townoroountry.
A correspondent says—""A pugilistic encounter
took place at 6 o'clock on Thursday morning, Jan.
'•12, ia Fenn'fl section, Kensington, between two 'bus
drivers asmed Waples and Heberman. The fight
was eondoded in 24 rounds, which lasted 46 minutes.

AN ADDRESS
To the Committee of the Maitland Hospital for
1848.
Maitland boroughs exalted firm and free,
May well be called the towns of charity;
O'er East and West, where ere we turn our eyes,
Are hands stretch'd out the Hospital to rise,
Their bounty strews, the fabrick will proclaim
The proud preeminence of Maitland's fame,
For not alone to kindred or to clan
The Maitland District proves the friend to man,
Before the light of Pity's Heavenly ray,
The mists of sorrow melt in air away,
T'is yours to guard from wretchedness and woe
The Sick, the Helpless, and the Lame, also.
Go forward then in strength, pursue the plan,
Assured the ladies will be foremost in the van,
Of never ceasing efforts for the human race,
And showing kindness with a meeker Grace.

PUNCIPS CHRISTMAS CAROL.
Hasa comes Clhrismas-ancient, jolly,
Crown'd with rnmisletoe and holly.
Oh ! the pleasure, ole the treat,
To behold the joints of meat
With a concourse whilst we stop.
Gazing at each butcher's shop
And the turkey-laden coaches,
Thickly thronging Town's approaches:
But a crowd, too numerous,
Answers, "" What is that to us .'
In each grocer's window, see
What a heap of spicery !
Citron, cloves, and cinnamon
What a sight to look upon !
Candied orange peel, and plums.
Nutmegs, raisins, figs in drums;
What delicious visions rise,
Of plum puddings and mince pies !
Ah hut thousands answer thus:
so Well-a-day ! what's that to us?""
Some, alas! there are to whom
Christmas brings but cold and gloom,
No warm fire, and no good cheer,
Though it comes buhot once a year;
Gentlefolks, suppose we try
It we cannot change their cry..
And provide them with a reason

HONOR TO THE PLOUGH.
Though clouds o'ercast our native sky,
And seem to dim the sun,
We will not down in langour lie,
Or deem the day is done:
The rural arts we loved before,
No less we'll cherish now;
And crown the banquet, as of yore,
With Honor to the Plough.
In these fair fields, whose peaceful spoil
To faith and hope are given,
We'll seek the prize with honest toil,
And leave the rest to Heaven.
We'll gird us to our.,vork like men,
Who own a 'holy vow,
And if in joy we ieet again,
Give Honor to iThe Plough.
Let Art, array'd In magic power,
With labour hand in hand,
Go forth, and now in peril's hour
Sustain a sinking land.
Let never Sloth unnerve the arm,
Or Fear the spirit cow;
These words alone should work a charm
All Honor to the Plough.
The heath redress, the meadow drain,
The latent swamp explore,
And o'er the'long-expecting plain
Diffuse the quickening store;
Then fearless urge the furrow deep
Up'to the mountain's brow ;
And when the rich results you reap,
Give Honor to the Plough.
So still shall Health by pastures green,
And nodding harvest roam,
And still behind her rustic screen
Shall virtue find a home.
And while their bower the muses build
Beneath the neighbouring bough,
Shall many a grateful verse be fill'd
With Honor to the Plough.

There was Liza Brlggs, contralto .

And the tendr who was.rnoted
For the clearness of his tones.
But the basso was?, the stunner-'

It would fairly knock the slivets,
So to speak, right dff of songi ,
I can recollect the anthem
.Always sung on Christmas day,:
""Gloo-ry.e, gloo-rye, in the 'ighest!""
We could hear the tenor say.
Then the 1basso joined the effort.

AN ENGLISH SCENE.
A fountain's face the feathery moss
In a green sheet had crept across,
And cover'd half the low wall, piled
Like a grot's ruins, round about it;
And 'mong the wild grass flowers grew wild,
Beside a stream which gush'd from out it.
And o'er it grew grand old oak,
Which ne'er had felt tempests stroke-
Whose heavy arms, though sorely wrinkled
With age, yet wore a shining robe
Of green and tender leaves; which twinkled
In the last light of day's low orb.
Beside the fountain-stream a child
Sat musing 'midst the flow'rets wild-
A boy of beauty, with blue eye
Fix'd on the bubbling water, where
He, wandering, saw a pictured sky,
Himself the only angel there!
That streamlet flow'd, in murmurs soft,
Adown his father's co'ttage-croft;
The primrose 'neath the hedge row smiled
On either side the daisied green;
The woodbine up the thorn was piled,
Just as it every spring had been.
The cottage had a happy look,
A picture meet for poet's book:
Its yellow walls rose opposite
The way side oak; and round it grew
Laburnums, half concealing it,
With yellower bloom, from stranger's view.
And o'er its lowly thatch was seen
The blossom'd fruit trees richer sheen ,
The tops of bee-hives shone below,
Under an ivy cover'd shed:
And all seem'd there as long ago
'Twas plann'd by those who now were dead.
The lilac in its splendour gleam'd
Along the holly hedge, which hemm'd
The garden round: a low settee
Of neat-trimm'd boughs stood near the gate,
'Neath a young breezy aspen tree,
On which the peasant parents sat.
Though the croft's length between them lay
And travellers who pass'd that way,
They loved to sit at sunset there
And watch the lonely passer by,
And think what earthly joy or care
Might light or dim the stranger's eye.

THE CHIEF ""FRYINGPAN"" AGAIN.
[An incorrect version of the following speech having appeared
in the Sydney Herald, we are induced to publish the following,
which we have just received from our Illawarra corrrespondent,
whose proximity to the scene enables him to picture it with
accuracy.]
The chief is enraged with his tribe for hunting the opossum
while he was absent in pursult of the kangaroo; his royal
wrath is the more enkindled, inasmuch as he returned from the
chase without one kangaroo fat enough for the butcher's shop:
and, whenever he falls in with the vassals of his territory in
corrobora asssembled, he bursts forth into impassioned speeches,
as loud and incoherent as a drunken man in a public-house.
Know ye not, sons of Koomla* that I am your chief?
As sable+ as midnight--uncurbed as the deep!
I'm your master at boomerang, spear, and canoe,
I am foremost in chasing the wild kangaroo.
Behold me then, vassals dark, foaming in wrath;
I am choking with rage--I'm almost out of breath
At your daring presumption, while I was away
After game, at the kangaroo grounds, t' other day.
Yes! have ye not daringly hunted for food,
For your poor piccaninies, through my royal wood?
You have traversed my mountains, have fished my lagoons,
To procure meat and drink for your low-bred gossoons.
Hear my voice, sons of Koomla, nor breathe while I speak,
Impressed be my words in your hearts long and deep;
I'm the natural guardian of Wollongong's youth--
And you'd feed your young fry in my absence, forsooth.
To the cries of your offspring mean, craving relief,
You have hearkened, and slighted the pride of your chief;
You've sought for your children the daintiest food,
Though ye knew I would keep it for children of blood.
Neither wallaby, emu, opossum, nor fish,
Was reputed for beggars too dainty a dish.
Oh! ""Disgrace!"" oh! ""Dishonour!!"" ""Impertinence""
too!!!
I'm surpised you don't treat them to fat kangaroo.
Ye are wheedled and puzzled, confounded as mules,
Ye have given the lie to your chiefs, stupid fools;
Go undo what you've done, else the fire of my brow
Will be kindled against you, I'll kick up a row.
Let immediate reaction take place, out of hand,
Come, besiege the old Gonieu at my dread command:
What! hesitate! stammer!! explain!!! disobey!!!!
Oh, thou ghost of thy father! I envy thy day.
Haste, thy spirit infuse in the veins of thy son;
Thy Fryingpan's checked in his pride, he's undone:
My glory is tarnished--it remains for the grave,
To commingle my bones with the dust of the slave.
* Koomla is a prominent and noble mountain in the Illa-
warra range.

A CALM.
The veil of night o'erspreads the torrid sky,
Through which a whelming gush of starlight breaks,
Oppresively resplendent to the eye,
As from his feverish sleep the sailor wakes-
Stretched on the deck, which now he nightly makes
His pillow, when his weary watch is done;
And the great moon is risen again, and takes
Her way through heaven still glowing from the sun,
And on the deaden'd deep our bark's a lonely one.
A fearful calm is dwelling on the sea,
As 'twere the waters dreaming in their sleep:
And heaven is full of a placidity
As awful as the slumber of the deep.
The few light clouds which on the horizon keep
Have in their aspect an ethereal death;
And vain the goodliest vessel a power to sweep
Along the waters-there is not a breath
Of air to stir her sails, the blinding moon beneath.
A BREEZE.
Look up among the multitude of lights,
Which hang in heaven so senseless and serene;
Behold the glory of these tropic nights --
Methought the azure depths which lie between
Those fairy worlds, where God is surely seen!
Look up in pious love's supremacy,
As glides our bark swift through the glowing scene;
And thy Creator's omnipresence see,
Where'er thy soul can search, some glimpse of Deity !
Oh, mortal ! tear the serpent from thy brow,
Thy pride of heart should not profane thee here ;
God on the waters waits thy worship now,
The God who loves the lowly heart sincere.
And who, tonight, could view and not revere
The hand which framed those shining mysteries,
Still shedding o'er each world's allotted sphere
The shadow of his glory ? The glad seas,

A resting place on Ausratlusi'a n trand:
The wild bush stetinwinlg far o'er ridge and creek,
The homesteads scattered o'er the smiling land,
The expanse of quiet waters, and tile glelam
Of the tair city in tile summer beam
Opening t:t once upon the pilgriml's eyes,
Beneath th' unbroken uzure of the skiem.
And many a scene of coltlnt peneefulness
Whi[ch ierts the wonderer as ctze, Ilis hopes to bles,
Whlce'er he turns his please d, impatlent look,
As glides his proud bark o'er the glittering wave
leers sweetly forth from its embosom'd nook
Among the woods of evelgreen, to have
Its beauty trtnsured nui in mtemory's ltot?.
And groups of hIappiy idlers on thu shore I
'Pace the bright ganlens sltitng yonder bay:
Men from his native city, lhaply, stray
Among tile loiterers there !-He now recalls
Scenes of his childhood-flower.hung waterfalls,
Moss-mantled rocks, mll hills and valleys grsen,
And woods with English cottages betweetn
In his own land, alas I no faor away:
And dreams of those, the innocent iand gay,
WhVo in his young henart's love had earliest place,
Shut out all other beauty.
The dim trace
Of primitive seclusion shadowelh yet
The strange old rocks, half polished where men sit
'To muse awhile, and weep for absent friends,
On the friquented beach. But Albion sends
Forth her adventurers, on the hills to plant
The social banner of goodwill and love !
As still retreats the dark Itnhabitant
To deeper solitudes, still onwaord move
Th' insatiable new comenrs, to possess
The Inmonst bosom of tie wildenless.
Yet shall it be a blessed work, the giving
Of a now life unto the darkly living;
Though mingled witll slinbhorn misery
The white man's boon to the poor savage be.
Land of the stranger's hope I 'mid the far seas
Reserved in peace for the world's refugees,
By raging war's commotions undefiled ;
A wilderness in grntdeur only wild,
Where everry ?eciol sweet of every clime
Shall yet hbe gathered in sonme aler time ;
And brotherly and hleav'.tdireeted love,
And knowledge sweet, and mercy from above,
Shall hartmontse society!-here, men
Shall have forgot the name of foeman then.

In Sydney a man was sent to gaol for six months for having told fortunes
by tea cup reading. ]
THE queer discriminations used He had no cup to be his guide,
In this law-ridden land No cards, no crystal ball;
Leave me bewildered and confused. Yet, heavens! How he prophesied!
What man can understand You'd think he knew it all.
Why this soothsayer they acclaim Dread doom awaited us, he warned,
And with high honours hail, Death and destruction grim,
While that poor prophet, sunk in shame, Lest we the other Party scorned
Ignobly goes to jail? And cast our votes for him.
Because he peers upon a palm Was he arrested on the spot
And speaks of things apart— And bundled into quod
Of ""dark men"" looming, strong and calm, For fortune-telling? He was not,
To thrill some spinster heart (I thought it rather odd)
And wake fond dreams; or else, because Tho' his proud promise of content
He looks into a cup Was gues work; clearly rash,
And lies. They say he breaks the laws, They put him into Parliament
And coppers mop him up. And gave him wads of cash.
Yet if it be against the law The queer discriminations used
Men's fortunes to fortell, In cases such as these
What of that other man I saw Leave me bewildered and bemused
(Indeed, I know him well) 'Mid inconsistencies

And promised paradise, Tho' perjured to the eyes,
Prosperity and endless good, The other gets it in the neck,

MR. WOOLIN-WISTER
MR. WOOLIN-WISTER was assistant at the store.
He had an air of breeding, and the kind of clothes he wore
Were very, very natty, and exceedingly correct;
For every single day he went habitually decked
In the very latest fashion; and he had a roving eye
That wakened many a smile demure and many a gentle sigh,
For, whene'er he sought to ""twit"" them, then the ladies straight began:
""Now, Mr. Woolin-Wister! Oo, you are a naughty man !""
He wore a wide straw-decker with a pretty coloured band;
His pants—the shepherd plaid ones—were the tightest in the land;
He wore a braided coat, with vest—in summer-time a sash—
And a set of heavy sideboards and a very large moustache;
His hair combed on his forehead in a very genteel ""slick,""
He made just the perfect masher with his silver-headed stick.
And thro' the street, when he walked out, the female titters ran:
""There is Mr. Woolin-Wister. Oo, he is a saucy man !""
His linen, was immaculate. His broad stiff-bosomed shirt
Upheld a three-inch collar; and he was a fearful flirt.
For he flirted with the matrons and he flirted with the maids;
At conversation lollies he was boldest of the blades;
For the things he used to pass them at a soiree or a dance
Caused many a maiden blush to glow and many a downward glance;
Yet many a maiden giggled, as she peeped behind her fan:
""Fie, Mr. WooLin-Wister! Oo, you are a forward man !""
When last I saw the old town, I went Into the store,
And there was Mr. Woolln-Wister—tlll a bachelor.
His pate was bald, his eye was dull, his grey moustache was clipped,
And his general demeanor seemed considerably hipped
Then a lady (rather elderly), came tripping in the shop,
And Mr. Woolin-Wister let all other matters drop.
Then she gushed and then she giggled as the persiflage began:
""Now Mr. Woolin-Wister ! Oo, you are an awful man!""",The Queenslander ,"878,0,348,1065,1201,1351,1067,1064,1192,1382,1565,1292,1349,1518,1365,1378,1520,1562,1456,1234,1300,1245,1470,1188,1367,1542,1362,1268,1247,1185,1551,1251,1276,1149,1469,1258",Thu 9 Jan 1936,"397,0,430,559,690,732,776,822,872,909,953,1000,1074,1118,1164,1208,1252,1296,1340,1384,1458,1504,1546,1592,1635,1677,1721,1764,1841,1887,1931,1973,2016,2061,2102,2148","3202,0,4258,3375,3118,3241,3117,3117,3117,3117,3117,3117,3117,3120,3120,3117,3117,3118,3118,3123,3117,3117,3117,3120,3121,3123,3123,3124,3117,3117,3117,3126,3124,3124,3121,3121",23380271,Page 7

Bill Jones went to the grocer's shop
To buy a pound of tea,
And said to Johnson, standing there;
""Will you one with me?""
And Johnson said he didn't mind
(He loved Bill like a brother);
They had two pounds, then Johnson said,
""We'd better have another.
Then Smith came in and Jones proposed,
They'd have another pound :
And then they stood till Brown came in
And shouted tea all round.
And there they stayed for several hours
As happy as could be,
Till each one of the party had
Some fourteen pounds of tea.
And every one who saw them said
""What fools those fellows be,
To stand around here all day long ,
A-shouting pounds of tea !""
Had they been shouting whiskey, schnapps,
And brandy, rum, and beer,
Until they all got speechless drunk,
It would not seem so queer :
But things that they could cart away
And use some other time !

Men have said that ye were sleeping—
Hurl—Australians—back the lie ;
Whet the swords you have in keeping,
Forward stand to do or die.
Hear ye not—across the ocean,
Echoes of the distant fray,
Sounds of loud and and fierce commotion,
Swiftly sweeping on the way?
Hearts have woke from sluggish trances,
Woke to know their native worth ;
Freedom with her train advances—
Freedom newly sprung to birth.
Despots start from thrones affrighted—
Tyrants hear the angry tread;
Where the slaves—whose prayers were slighted,
Marching—draw the sword instead.
If the men of other nations
Dash their fetters to the ground ;
When the foeman seeks your stations,
Will you willing slaves be found ?
You the sons of hero fathers—
Sires that bled at Waterloo !
No—your indignation gathers—
To your old traditions true.
Should the cannon's iron rattle
Sound between your harbour doors,
You will rise to wage the battle
In a just and righteous cause.
Patriot fires will scorch Oppression
Should it dare to draw too near ;
And the tide of bold Aggression
Must be stay'd from coming here.
Look upon familiar places,
Mountain, river, hill and glade;
Look upon those beauteous faces,
Turning up to you for aid.
Think ye—in the time of danger,
When that threat'ning moment comes,—
Will ye let the heartless stranger,
Drive your kindred from their homes?
By the prayers which rise above you,
When you face him on the shore,—
By the forms of those that love you,
Greet him with the rifle's roar.
While an arm can wield a sabre,
While you yet can lift a hand,
Strike, and teach your hostile neighbour,
This is freedom's chosen land.",Empire ,"498,329,542,499,580,411,469,675,657,444,618,512,494,474,559,449,750,535,424,496,575,502,438,419,446,659,692,536,692,656,533,628,483,655,402,488,506,390,692,653,510,652,690,492,546,461,690,439,681,598",Mon 20 Aug 1860,"715,779,809,840,871,903,935,961,996,1029,1060,1090,1122,1153,1183,1216,1244,1277,1340,1370,1402,1433,1464,1495,1527,1552,1588,1618,1648,1676,1711,1744,1775,1798,1868,1898,1932,1962,1987,2020,2057,2080,2111,2149,2180,2211,2242,2273,2303,2335","4981,5063,4941,4978,4939,4977,4941,4979,4944,4980,4943,4982,4944,4982,4945,4982,4945,4983,4949,4985,4949,4987,4949,4988,4952,4989,4953,4987,4952,4989,4952,4989,4952,4988,4951,4989,4951,4992,4951,4989,4950,4988,4951,4991,4950,4986,4949,4998,4952,4988",60496544,Page 5

Dark is her cheek- but her blood's rich blush,
How it comes through its dusk like a sunset flush!
While joy, like a prairie bee, slaketh its drout,v
At the red honey cup* of her smiling mouth;
And her wild eyes shine, like planet stars rare,
'Neath the streaming storm of her night black hair!
And ever I pride in my forest choice
The more while I list to her bird-like voice,
Warbling old songs in her own wild speech,
But aye with this new refrain to each:
Who'll pity--who'll comfort the dark-plumed Dove,
When the white hawk leaves her to die of love?
Oh, then, by the artless tears that rise
'Neath the downcast lids of her gloaming eyes-
By the truthfully tender and touching grace
That boiling passion than lends her face,
I swear in the very wild spirit of love
Never to part from my Indian Dove!

(From a MS. Poem)
BY HENRY KENDALL.
Though he rallied in the morning, long before the close of
day
He had sunk, the worn-out hero, fainting, dying, by the
way !
But with death he wrestled hardly, three times rising from
the soil,
Yet a little farther onward, o'er the weary waste, he trod ;
Facing Fate with heart undaunted, still the chief would
totter on
Till the Evening closed about him — till the strength to
more was gone !
Then he penned his latest writings, and, before the life was
spent,
Gave the records to his comrade — gave the watch he said
was lent ;
Gave them with his last commandments, charging him that
night to stay,
But to let him lie unburied when the soul had passed away !
Hearken to the brave words spoken when he felt the coming
end,
When he turned and told his wishes to the firm and faithful
friend :
""Closer, sit where you can hear me — this will sorely soon be
past,
We have struggled hard against it, but I'm too far gone to
last !
You must try to bear up longer, there is succour on our
track,
If you live till it arrives here, take this watch, they lent me,
back ;
Take it and the note-hooka with you ; from the note-hooks
they will learu . ' ?'
Something of our baffled movements-something of our sad
retnrn !
I have been too weak to write mnoh,' hence the records are
bot few, . ; ' '''':
But you'll tell them what I cannot, and I hope and trust in
' yon I
And for God's sake stay beside me I in this Wild and lonely
place,
It is now si comfort to be near à friendly human faoe 1
Tarry here till all is over, so that you may see me die ;
I shall poss away oontented. knowing some one lingers by I
When you find that 1 have left von, do not move from hence
my bones ¡ .
Do not hide them in the darkness of a heap of doBt and
. stones j . "" . '
Let them lie uncovered, comrade, bare and bleaching on the
land - ' ?. i
But this pistol,' which I give you, leave it loaded in my
hann I""
Through that night he uttered little, rambling were the
words ho spoke ; ' . '?'
And ho turned and died in silence, when the tardy morning
broke I .
Many memories como together whilst in sight of death we
dwell,
Muoh of sweet and sad reflection through the weary mind
must well !
As tlioso long hours glided past him,' till tho east with light
was fraught,
Who may know the mournful seoret-who can tell us what
he thought ?
Very lone ond vory'wrotohed was tho brave man left behind'
Wandering over leagues of wasteland, seeking, hoping help
to find;
Sleeping in deserted wurleys, fearful, many night-falls
through, '.' .
Lost unfriendly hands should rob bim of his meal of wild
nardoo 1
When ho reached their old encampment, when the well-known
' spot was gaioed,
He bsd yet a hope within him that his other friend re .
mnined 1
So ho searched for food to givo him, trusting they might
both survive
Till the aid so long oxpeeted from the cities should arrive ;
So he shot three crows and took them to tho gunyah where
he found
Him, whom he had thought to succour, cold and lifeless on
tho ground 1
Weak and wearied with his journey, there the sole survivor
Btooped,
And the disappointment bowed him, and his heart with
nad r.css drooped,
But. he. rose and raked a hollow with his wasted, feeble
hands, > ..; -
Where he took and hld the hero In the rushes and the sands:
But boj like a brother, laid him out of roach of wind and
rain,
And for many days he sojourned near him, on that wild
faced plain,
Whilst ho stayed besido the ruin, whilst he lingered with
i the dead, s . ¡ .?
Ohl he must haye sat in darknecB - gloomy as the tears
he shod.
. . . i . . ». .
Where our noble Barko was lying-whore his sad com-
panions stood
Came the nativos of the forest-came tLe wild men of the
wood :
Down they looked and saw tho stranger-him who there in
quiet slept
Down they knelt,ando'er the chieftain bitterly they moaned
and wept. ?
Bitterly thoy mourned to sceliim.nll uncovered to the blast,
AU uncovered to tho tempest as it walled and whistled past,
And they shrouded him with bushes so in death that he
' might He,
Like a warrior of their nation, sheltered from the storm and
sky. ...

The verdant ivy clings around
Yon moss be-mantled wall;
As if it sought to hide the stones,
That crumbling soon must fall :
That relic of a bygone age--
Now tottering to decay--
Has but one friend-the ivy-left,
The rest have pass'd away.
II
The fairy flowers that ones did bloom
And smile beneath its shade;
They linger'd till the autumn came,
And autumn saw them fade :
The emerald leaves-that blush'd between,-
The winds away have blown ;
But yet, to cheer the mournful scene,
The ivy liveth on.
III.
Thus heavenly Hope will still survive,
When earthly joys have fled ;
And all the flow'ry dreams of youth
Lie withering and dead :
When winter comes-it twines itself
Around the human heart ;-
And like the ivy on the wall.
Will ne'er from thence depart.

A vale between them threaded by a rill,
And either standing on a distant hill,

How those two clodhoppers expressed their views.

As shepherds ool lament at Weyhill Fair?

But their disaise is small pox out and out.

And pigs our sort o' poor relations be,
The difference 'twixt ourselves and ship is wide;

BY THOMAS HOOD.
In Brenford town, of old renown,
There lived a Mr Bray,
Who fell in love with Lucy Bell,
And so did Mr Clay.
To see her ride from Hammersmith,
By all it was allowed,
Such fair outsides were seldom seen,
Such Angels on a Cloud.
Said Mr Bray to Mr Clay,
""You choose to rival me,
And court Miss Bell, but there your court
No thoroughfare shall be.
""Unless you now give up your suit,
You may repent your love;
I who have shot a pigeon match,
Can shoot a turtle dove.
""So pray before you woo her more,
Consider what you do;
If you pop aught to Lucy Bell--
I'll pop it into you.""
Said Mr Clay to Mr Bray,
""Your threats I quite explode;
One who has been a volunteer
Knows how to prime and load.
""And so I say to you, unless
Your passion quiet keeps,
I who have shot and hit bull's eyes,
May chance to hit a sheep's.""
Now gold is oft for silver changed,
And that for copper red;
But these two went away, to give
Each other change for lead.
But first they sought a friend a piece,
This pleasant thought to give--
When they were dead, they thus should have
Two seconds still to live.
To measure out the ground not long
The seconds then forbore,
And having taken one rash step,
They took a dozen more.
They next prepared each pistol-pan
Against the deadly strife,
By putting in the prime of death
Against the prime of life.
Now all was ready for the foes,
But when they took their stands,
Fear made them tremble so they found
They were both shaking hands.
Said Mr C. to Mr B.,
""Here one of us may fall,
And like St. Paul's Cathedral now,
Be doomed to have a ball.
""I do confess I did attach
Misconduct to your name;
If I withdraw the charge, will then
Your ramrod do the same?""
Said Mr B.--""I do agree--
But think of Honor's Courts!
If we go off without a shot,
There will be strange reports.
""But look, the morning now is bright
Though cloudy it begun;
Why can't we aim above, as if
We had called out the sun.""
So harmless up into the air,
Their bullets they did send;

SATINO) LIFE.-We have much pleasure in transfer-
ring to our. .columns the following account of lives
saved by Captain R, L Patterson of tins city. As far
baot as thc year 1826 he saved the life of a little boy
ai Leith. The little fellow fell into the harbour, and
was with great difficult; extricated, as there was a
great depth of mud where he fell. The next life that
he saved was that of a lady-also at Leith-who fell
from the gangway in leaving a steamboat. We next
find him saving lifo in this colony-lie saved the lifo
of Mr. Samuel Bayley, or East Maitland, who was
knocked overboard from the steamer Victoria by a large
sea off Nobby's. Captain Patterson waa guided to
him by the sea gulls hovering over him as he was
floating in the water. In 184*2 he saved a man named
Winter, who jumped overboard from the Bose, steamer,
twenty miles from Sydney. Tn 1843 he saved all
hands, ten in number, from a schooner which was run
over in a dense fog by the Rose steamboat. He also
saved the lifo of Mr. Pitt, of East Maitland, who fell
from the gangway in leaving the Rose steamer ; also
the lifo of the Kev. Mr, Bolton, who also fell from the
gangway. In the year 1864 he'saved thc crew of tho
Patterson Packet, which capsized in a heavy thunder
sqnall off Broken Bar. In 1853 the brig Deva wont
ashore on the Oyster Bank : the lifeboat went to her
and got swamped. Captain Patterson swam off with
aline to her, and succeeded in getting the lifeboats and
all hands on shore, with thc exception of one man
named Long Dick, who was drowned. In 1854 he
saved tho life of a man named Lanogan, who foll from
the ganaway of the Ben Bolt steamer. In 1858 he
saved the life of Mr. O'Brien, who fell from the gang-
way of the Patterson steamboat. The following is
part of an extract from the Herald in the year 1854 :
"" The Sydney Griffiths barque, from Melbourne, in
attempting to enter the harbour on the evening of the
23id instant, missed stajs, and went ashore on the
Oyster Bank. Captain Griffiths ordered his boats on
immediately for help, and the pilot boat manned by
volunteers (the orew having deserted), with the steamer
Ben Bolt, started to her assistance, when, after consi*
derable difficulty and danger, Captain Patterson suc-
ceeded in getting her off and towing her into port.
The ship docs not appear to have sustained much
damage, and her safety is chiefly, if not entirely, to be
attributed to the able assistance of the Ben Bolt and
her energetic commander."" He also saved the life of
Mrs. Sutcliffe, who fell from the Sophia Jane, at Mor-
peth. She was five minutes in the water before rescued.
This was in the year 1839. Numerous other instances
could be enumerated, but the foregoing will be suffi-
cient to shew that if any Ono deserves a gold medal for I
saving life, Captain Patterson is the man. Besides 1
thc foregoing instances in which Captain Patterson i
has saved life may be added the following, which !
Captain Patterson made ut acquainted with. On tho
24th of May, in the year 1888. a man was smoking
rats out of a vessel's hold in Sydnoy, when he became
nearly suffocated, and must inevitably have perished
but for Captain Patterson, who descended into the
ship's hold, and at the imminent risk of his own life,
saved that of a fellow-creature from a most dreadful
death. On reaching the deck of tho vessel the resoued
mnn was nearly dead, and Captain Patterson himself
was in a very exhausted state,-Newcastle Chronicle.
A DWELLES IN int CAVE.-An extraordinary caso
came before tho Sunderland magistrates en the 18th.
A pitman named Thomas Robson was summoned for
refusing to quit a cave he had hollowed oat for his
occupation in tbeeoa bank», on tho lands of the Eccle-
siastical Commissioners, who wero the summoning
parties. Their only objeot woe to Induce Robson to
quit ""the premises;"" but neither threats or.persuasion
could succeed.' It transpired, during the hearing of the
case, that the defendant took it into his Heid to leave
his employment at Ryhope Ojllerv, and the honie he
occupied, for the purp'se of excavating a habitation ont
of the sea banks. Be made himself a nice entrance ant
out a room of considerable size, and made a holoat the
top for a chimney. Tho place waa timbered on the
alites and the roof; but though he had fitted it np in a
stylo that might be comfortable to live in, there waa
danger of it giving w»y, and some morning he might
ii» d himself on the beach. The eave was about half
way up the bank, and about forty feet from the beach,
and was approached by a winding path. The defendant
proving obstinate to the last, a fine of £5 was inflicted,
and relusing topsy, be waa looked up. In tbs after-
noon, cou e policemen and about a dozen navvies pro-
ceeded to the cave, wb re' they found Ibo defendan's
wifo'B sister in possession. On being asked lo remove
the furnituro and leave she refused, dedaring she
would stick to the place until »ho died, and they wonld
have to bury her thrre, Thoy were ultimately obliged
to remove both her and tho furniture by force, alter

A FAIRY TALE
A poor pilgrim came down from a dry
arid clime,
He murmured with anguish, ""Will I be
there in time ?
In this sad weary world fate has played
me hard tricks,
But 'twould now cap the lot if I'm not
there at six.""
The road it was dusty, the hot wind sent
forth,
From the drought stricken plains far
away to the north.
He had come on a bender a dollar to
burst,
Consumed all day with a most awful
thirst.
A mile distant yet as 'twas writ on the post,
Then came to the plot where they'd
oft seen the ghost.
He hurried his pace, but sad was his
fate ;
He arrived at his goal just a few minutes
late.
He came to the pub as the clock had
struck six,
And begged for a drink to relieve his sad fix,
But the landlord said, ""No, for I've
heard that before,
As I know to my cost, for I've just paid
a score.""
""Oh, just give me one drink,"" the poor
pilgram did cry,
""For I know I am ill and I fear I shall
die.""
Still the landlord, said ""No, though it
does seem a shame,
But the sexton is idle 'twill come here
just the same.
Are you not aware of these new fangled
laws
That are brought into force for the
temperance cause ?
For we are like yourself in a most awful
fix,
As we dare not sell rum, beer or wine
after six.
And I tell you just now that I fear 'twill
be worse,
For this option, called local, will soon be
our curse ;
For then be a man near the grave on the
brink,
Not for love or hard cash will he get
some strong drink,
And be of with you now, just as quick
as you can,
For the trooper we have is a most rigid
man ;
If he sees you near here you are sure to
be fined,
So hurry off now and don't look behind.""
The poor traveller went forth, to the
corner he went,
Where the boys congregate all on politics
bent.
So they said to him then : ""Oh, poor
man, you seem ill,
Has your heat ceased to throb, is your
pulse standing still ?""
""I've travelled all day in the heat,"" he
replied,
""And, I fear I am, ill, for its awful
inside,
I've been to the landlord some spirits to
crave,
But he turned me away, not one tricktlet
he gave.""
So they said: ""Oh, poor man, we are
sure if you'd go
With your tale of distress to the good
Priest we know,
He would give you relief, for your woeful
complaint,
For he's generous alike to both sinner
and saint.""
""Oh tell me oh where shall I find this
good Priest.
Shall I travel out West, shall I go to the
East ?""
""You will find him at home if to East
you will go,
But be careful to tell him a sad tale of
woe.""
So with hope in his heart to the good
Priest he went,.
For relief for his thirst, for some whisky
intent.
The good Father heard with a studious mind
The tale he did pitch, for he'd oft heard
the kind,

Of Church and State it might be said,
The Devil is the living head:
For Satan, as traditions tell,
Forsook bright heaven, to reign in hell.
Tho' mighty proud of his nobility,
He loves that pride which apes humility:
But how the Devil lays pretension
To Church and State, t'were well to mention,
When we are told that both combined
Doth deal salvation to mankind.
First then the Church we'll briefly view,
And then its state, and bid adieu.
I.
If it be true, as Gospel vouches,
The Apostles never lin'd their pouches,
Or even had a change of garment,
Unlike the present kind of varmint,
Who horse-leech like still, cry ""give, give,""
The poor may starve, the church must live.
Cry ""money is the root of evil,""
Keep it themselves, so cheat the devil,
Nay even sell their very living,
T'were too absurd to think of giving.
II.
Around the throne the Prelates wait,
O'er towering all, with pride elate,
Squabbling for precedence and power,
They some times prove the grapes are sour.
Next comes the Bishop, then the Dean
In scarlet robes and silken sheen;
Vouch they can scarcely live--'tis queer,
Upon two thousand pounds a year.
That they'll all starve, they're much afraid,
Unless they can prolong State Aid.
III.
These precious wolves in sheepskin clad!
(The thought's enough to drive one mad,)
Like Dives in the Gospel fable,
Thus live in pride--keep a good table;
Aye! some have hinted even a stable.
Some say, the fair sex they adore;
Such scandal I will hear no more;
And as to preaching--can't endure it,
But leave it to the half-starved Curate.
IIII.
Yes Minor Canon, Rector, Bishop,
Doth swallow all the loaves and fish up;
Their bretheren poor they treat with jest,
Some must be greater than the rest.
But what is intellect or mind,
If not with patronage combin'd?
The Church knows well the worth of both,
Extracts the meat, and leaves the broth,
Well spiced with bitter herbs--to endure it
No living thing could, but a Curate.

And I never heard a woice more louder and

Nor never seed in all my life-good gracions!

Oh Lola she vos fair, and Lola she vos kind too,
But cruel vos the company she brought with her
to "" star"".
And to put up vith all their bounce she didn't
feel inclined to.
So took her passage in the Melbourno steamer

I tried all I knowd as in duty bound, to stop her,
And vent on board the steamer vith a half a
dozen rits,
But Lola quite perlitely said she'd never pay
a copper,
And gave me sich a killing look as fairly turned
lmy vits.

Oh! I showed to her the rings as is hon my little
fingers,
And I showed to her the eye-glass vieh I vears
to come it grand,
And I vispered in her hear as she vos loveliest of
singers.
Disclosed my long attachment, and then hoffercd
her my hand.

you,
Nor man nor woman ever yet did Lola Mon-

Pray take a friendly hint, for I wish not to
aggrieve you
If not off at once, you'll overboard be bundled

Now vot vos I to do-I saw as how she meant it
For mischief vos a twinkling in her eye as I got

So I said as how I hoped she never vould re
