A quiet song for Ellen--
Tho patient Ellen Ray,
A dreamer in the nightfall--
A watcher in the day;
The wedded of the Sailor
Who keeps so far away ;
A shadow on his forehead
For patient Ellen Ray.
When autumn winds were driving
Across the chafing bay
He said the words of anger
That wasted Ellen Ray ;
He said the words of anger,
And went his bitter way :
Her dower was the darkness--
The patient Ellen Ray
Your comfort is a Phantom,
My patient Ellen Ray ;
You house it in the night-time,
It fronts you in the day !
And when the Moon is very low,
And when the lights are gray,
You sit and hug a sorry hope,
My patient Ellen Ray !
You sit and hug a sorry hope--
Yet who will dare to say
The sweetness of October
Is not for Ellen Ray ?
The bearer of a burden
Must rest at fall of day;
And you have borne a heary one,
My patient Ellen Ray.
HENRY KENDALL.
