jL)ouor.ASs v. DuciiEY.-This was an action- to- res
cover £11, the price of a cask of almonds. It nppearecj
according to the evidence of the plaintiff, that Douglass,
purchased at Dean's auction roora several casks of
almonds, at the rate of tenpence per pound, and de-
fendant, being present, afterwards pur.-hased one of
the lots at tho rate of eleven pence per pound. The
almonds were delivered, but payment was refused on
i the ground that the goods were not according to sample;
Nine days elapsed before tile defendant sent the note
declining to receive the almonds, nhile the agreement
between the auctioneer and the plaintiff was that if
any objection were made it must be made within three
days after delivery, and this arrangement was known
' to the defendant. The defence was that the almonds
wero to be according to the sample produced at the
auction-rciom ; and as to the arrangement between the
auctioneer and the plaintiff, it was contended that the
defendant had nothing to do with that. The defen-
dant, in hisi. evidence, alleged that the
almonds. delivered to hitn were not worth,
more than one-third the value of those produced at
the nnction-roenn ""as a sample, and also that he had
lodged an objqetion to the goods within two or three
days after the.delirery. The Court found for plaintiff.
Riw.t v.wooLLt¡Y.-This was an action to recover
£29, money had and received, le appeared according
to the statement for the pUiotiif, that in December,
1855, Oaptaiq RiJpy delivered to tin* defendant certain
furniture for sale, in June, 1857, after repeated
applications, tho plaintiff received an account, which
showed the furniture to have been sold for
about £50, but certain oharg=s made
by the defendant, for eommirsion, advertising,
and repairing and poüshing 'he noods, reduced the
amount coming to the piaitiurf'to about £14. In this
account two card-tables de Ihcred by the plaintiff were
not mentioned at all ; these wein valued at £10 ; then
lhere were two overchaigea in the bill, of £15 and £4
respectively, and it was to recover the amount of these
three items that this action wm brought. This state-
ment was supported by the plaintiffV testimony. He
was told by a parson in the employ of the defendant
that the whole of his furniture was sold. One of the
overcharges wns-£20 for making borne alterations in a
chair, or tu-e-i.-tete, which plaintiff originally pur-
chased from defendant for £19. This amount he
allowed under protect. The evidence . of a
cabinot-makor was adduced to show that the
value of the alterations in the chair was about £7 10s.,
and that another of the overcharges, which was fo'r
polishing n piano, was exorbitant to the extent of.onc
half. Tfih defence was as to the ove>-oharg°s that the
work was dose when wages wfre very high. The
advocate for the defence contended that, as to the card
table there mii'-t be n non suit, inismuch as there was
no evidence that these were sold at all, and therefore
nn action could not be for money had and received ia
regard to these items., As -o the other items, the pleaç
were twofold-first, that the plaintiff having
given a receipt in retpect to the acr
count it was not ? competent to the
Court to disturb the transaction ; and secondly, that
the charges wore fair and reasonable. The evidence.
of the defendant and his formomar. was adduced in
suppeit of the reasonableness of the charges for alter-
ing and polishing the furniture. The latter spoke to
the delivery of the account and the giving the receipts
There was a conversation about the items before the
receipt was given, and the only one objected to was
that of £20. There was some question in the course
of the trial as to whether or not au interlineation in the
receipt given by plaintiff for the amount of £14 had
been written before or after the signature was affixed.
There was a positive contradiction as to'the numher of
men employed at plaintiff's house in polishing a piano
on one occasion. His Honor directed the assessors
that the chief difficulty in the case was, as to whethét
or not the receipt was geuuino in «ill respects. The
Court found for the plaintiff, anil assessed damages at
£20. Attorney for the'plairuif?, Mr. Michael1; for the

(Front the Illustrated London Netos.)
There are certain great political truths which, by the
mere force of moral impetus, though scouted, decried,
and ridiculed for years, at last become recognised as
facts which must triumph and must prevail. Catholic
Emancipation, Parliamentary Reform, and the Repeal
of the Corn Laws, were long looked upon as Utopian
dreams, which might, at most, admit of a chary and
grudging discussion ; but of their ultimate realisation
the most sanguine agitator scarcely dared to entertain,
in his own generation, a hope. It took years to force
upon our legislators the conviction that common rea-
son and common patience would not much longer hold
out against the doctrine, that because a British subject
believed in traMubstantution he was to be treated as a j
pariah and a felon ; that because proprietors of pocket
boroughs, in the lase stage of rottenness, like Gat- |
ton and Old Sarum, were desirous of bringing their j
nephews into the House of Commons as soon as ]
they conveniently could after being ""plucked"" at
Oxford, the wealthy and influential towns of Man-
chester and Liverpool were to be excluded from the
franchise ; and that because some hundred top-booted
agriculturists thought it a good thing that wheat
should rule high io the market, some twenty millions ¡
of Englishmen, whose lot it was to labour, should eat
bread leavened by a sense of injustice.
There can be no doubt that, not even excepting the
extension of the suffrage, Vote by Ballot is the most
important political question with which those in-
terested in the welfare of their country have to deal. I
The subject has been agitated for years. ""Pooh- i
poohed at first-then violently opposed-then re- |
luctantly recognised as a galling necessity whose
imperativeness could not be' controverted, but
which, by the agil« encouragement of supineness, I
might be indefinitely deferred-it has grown by a
gradual but slow process of accretion to such an in- i
controvertible entity, that not all the king's horses
nor all the king's men can pull the great principle
| evolved by vote by ballot down again.
Agitated for years in a firm, persevering, but tem-
perate manner, supported by most thinking minds, and
owing no small moral influence to the steadfast advo
cacy of the best-informed section of the Press, the
ballot has received on several occasions the expressed
approbation of Parliament ; but by some legislative
legerdemain, with whose intricacies we are unac-
quainted, this expression has been rather implied than
felt ; and though the principle of vote by ballot has
been accepted and endorsed by Parliament, the
accomplishment of the object in view has
been waived and deferred and shelvec"" ;
till the public, wearied with such delays,
appear disposed to appeal to the ultimo ratio regum,
and by the exercise of that often-threatened, but
seldom-resortod-to, mode of impulsion, known as the
"" pressure from without,"" force upon their unwilling
or neglectful legislators the task of doing them justice.
The meeting which is to be held next Monday, affords
earnest that the repeated wishes of the country at
at large, as expressed through its chosen delegates in
Parliament, can no longer be disregarded ; and if the
principle of the ballot be really acquiesced in by the
Legislature, that acquiescence should be no longer
a resnltless sham, bu*, a palpable and tangible truth.
The principal argument adduced by the opponents
of the ballot, ia that it is -'thoroughly un-English,""
that it tends to encourage s cut-throat, Judas-
like medium of voting, and that it is only
a machine for enabling a man to tell
a lie without being found out. In our
humble opinion, the ballot-box is a machine for
'enabling a man to tell the truth without being perse
outed, badgered, decried, frequently mined, for telling
the truth, bv those superior to him in wealth and au-
thority, and wicked, enough to wield that wealth and
authority to his detriment. Had the ballot been in
force, were the ballot in force now, the miserable
tenants of the Marquis of Waterford would not be
compelled to address their lord and master in terms
more becoming Russian serfs than British freemen.
They would not becompelled servilely and whiningly to
beg that one who, before the law, is no more than one
of themselves, would allow them to vote according to
the dictates of their consciences.' Were vote by balloc
the law of the land, John Turmuts need no longer
fear being turned out of his homestead because
he has recorded his vote in favour of Thomas
Ironbrace instead of the Honorable Felix
Optimus. Were vote by ballot the law, we could
scarcely be scandalised by the spectacle of "" scenes in
tho House,"" by the reoital of degrading intrignes be-
tween gentlemen and farm-labourers, attorneys and
beershop-keepers, haggling about the price of corrup-
tion, or squabbling over the fare of a journey to New
Orleans to be "" out of the woy "" of an election com-
mittee.
The ballot would, it is almost undeniable, afford a
genuinf security against bribery and corruption. We
have legislated in vain for years in the endeavour to
put down venality at elections. We have proscribed
treating-we have framed economical scales of ex-
penses for election contests, circumscribing the limits
of a cockade, and subjecting the exuberances of brass
bands and the fluttering of ribbon to the stern
supervision of election auditors. AU this has
been in vain. Whether it be due to the perverseness
of human naturo, or to the innate capacity for corrup-
tion exemplified by all holders of the franchise, it is
certain that no enactments have as yet been successful
in suppressing bribery ; that no law has yet been made
to really reach the candidate who promises the honest
and independent elector who will vote for him s ime
thing like twenty pounds sterling for a pair of welling-
ton boots, and no law is in force which will effectually
prevent the defeated and vindictive candidate from
wreaking his vengeance in the shape of withdrawal of
custom, or expulsion from tenancy, on the yeoman or
the householder who has dared to think for himBelf.
The ballot might save us from this standing reproach.
Another, and in our opinion a moBt fallacious, argu-
ment against the ballot is, that every voter ought ti
consider he had a public duty to discharge in the exer-
cise of his vote, and that his vote should consequently
be recorded confidently and publicly. It is precisely
because the voter has a public duty, and that he should
be allowed to discharge ""the duty conscientiously, and
without let or hindrance, that we advocate the ballot.
When landlords cease to coerce their tenants ; when
the humble possessor of the franchise ceases to know
that a plumper for the adverse candidates will ensure
his expulsion from the house where he was born, and
the ruin of the wife and family he loves ; when the
dishonest knave who would sell his vote, as, but for
a craven fear, he would sell himself, learns
that it is a matter of perfect indifference to
Blue or Buff candidate whether he be corrupt or no,
and that all his roguery will not help him in the way
of loaves or fishes-then and not till then, we may ex-
pect the voter to exercise his right in confidence and
in publicity, to enregister his vote exactly as he likeB
for or againBt the proprietor of the soil he cultivates,
and the patron of the Church where he was christened
and married, and in whose quiet graveyard he hopes
to repose when plumpers are no more spoken of, and
split votes are of no account.
The examples of France, America, Belgium, Hol-
land, and Australia, all argue in favour of the ballot.
When vote was first taken by ballot in France, there
were 300,000 more voting papers sent in than when
there were people to give them. In America, the sys-
tem has been tried since the first establishment of the
Republic, and has never yet been found
wanting. Every nation, save our own, has has-
tened to discard the cumbrous, antiquated, and ineffi-
cacious system of open voting ; anri every country,
inaugurating the representative system, adopts, as
one of its corner stones, the principle of vote by
ballot.
There is another argument at hand, nearer home,
and which is perhaps the most triumphant replication
that can be given to the enemies of the ballot. We
allude to the balloting system as applied to the clubs
of London. All the insinuations of meanness, hypo-
crisy, cowardice, and treachery preferred by the ad-
vocates of open-voting, against those of the ballot-box,
fall to the ground when we consider that this system,
approved and tried for years without the slightest ap-
proach to dissatisfaction, has been, and is, in use
amon¿; assemblies of the proudest gentlemen in the
world-men whose fame, like Bayard'B, is without I
fear and without reproach, and who have resorted to

To the'Editor of the Sydney Morning Herald.
Sir,-In your issue of yesterday a report of the inquest
held on the body of Charles Hollowell, late an inmate
of this institution, is inserted, in which it is stated that
a memorandum of which the following is a copy, was
foundonthe body :-""Ohas.Hollowell,6thMarch, 1858,
aged 53. After three years of misery-one year in the
Infirmary and two years in the Asylum-has got tired
of this life. He does not wish to be a burden to any
one: If I am wrong ' and if I am doing wrong, (and
that is a secret to anyone), may God help me. I do
not like to impose on any one. As for going back to the
Benevolent Asylum, I would rather meet death in any
, shape ; I have been there two years, and I am tired of
my life. 0.'H."" ""As a charity institution, it is
greatlv imposed on by the-(word nearly obli«
terated, but something like needy.) C. H.""
Thinking it probable that such a such a statement,
found under such circumstances, may have the effect,
of misleading the public in reference to the mode of
treatment the poor and needy meet with in this insti-
tution, I beg the favour of your inserting the follow-
ing facts in connection therewith :
1. The said Charles Hollowell was admitted into
this institution on the 15th January, 1856, suffering
from a severe fracture of the thigh (occasioned by
falling from his cab, while under the influence of
liquor), and for which he had been treated in the Infir-
mary during the preceding twelve months.
2. That during the whole time he was in the insti-
tution ho was treated with the utmost care-was
visited almost daily by numerous friends ; that, being

SUPREME COURT.-THURSDAY.
SITTINGS pon TUB TRIAL OP OAUSBS.
BEFORE the Chief Justice and a jury of four.
1IA.UT V. OKOZIBR.
This was nn action by a consignee Against a ship-
master io recover damages for injury, said to have re-
sulted from bad stowage, to several orates of crockery
ware during the Toynge from London to Sydney of
the ship Commonwealth. The pleadings were of a
special character raising four separate issues, but the
defence set up amounted to this : That £22,
which was paid into Court was sufficient to
cover all loss not resulting from "" breakage""
which has resulted from perils of the seas, and for
which tie defendant would not, under the bill of
lading, be liable, having taken due care of the goods.
Mr. Isaacs and Mr. Dalley appeared for the plain-
tiff and the Attorney-General, and Mr. Wise, for the
defendant.
That there had been a great deal of crockery dam-
aged there could be no doubt, but the evidence was
conflicting as to the extent of this damage and as to its
Causea. The plaintiff's claim was for £100, but he
estimated his actual losses at a good deal more than
this. There was evidence of an offer of £50 having
been mnde by the defendant in the way of compromise
although the defendant himBelf* had denied
having made such an offer. It was
admitted that the plaintiff would be bound to take due
care of the goods, and consequently, as was contended
by plaintiff's counsel, and held by his Honor, that
notwithstanding the exemption in the bill of lading he
would be responsible for breakage if it resulted from
negligence. There was evidence, however, that the
stowage wasgood, and that tho injury had resulted from
' the quantity of salt water shipped during very heavy
weather which the vessel encountered between the
Cape of Good Hope. This, it was stated, had rottod
the straw and caused the crates to work about and
become damaged as well as their contents.
The crates now in question and their con-
tents were abandoned to the defendant, and the
offer of £50 was said to have been made on
the assumption that plaintiff would take them, the
gross amount of damage having been estimated on the
defendant's part at about £70.
The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, with 40s.

Crown Prince, on heir apparent to the Emperor
Francis Joseph I. This event was announced in our
intelligence by the last mail from Europe ; but at the
time the news was received the Novara was in dock,
and her part in the celebration was therefore deferred
until this more convenient opportunity. In the morn-
ing religious servio waB engaged in onboard, the ship
was gaily bedecked with flags, and at sunrise, noon,
and evening, salutes of twenty-one guns each gave the
customary significance to the occasion. Further fes-
tivity, it is understood, will take place to-day in the
shape of a grand soiree dansante, for which the arrange-
ments and invitations bespeak an event of more than
UBual eclat.
Public Mbetin» at Newcastle.-On Wednesday
evening last a meeting in connection with the Colonial
Missionary Society, was held at the Congregational
Church. The attendance was numerous and respect-
able, and the attention of the auditory evinced a deep
interest in the proceedings. On the platform were the
Rev. Jaseph Beazley and Rev. W. Cuthbertson of
Sydney ; the Rev. Mr. Griffiths, of Maitland ; and the
Rev. Messrs. Green, Woolnough, and Chaucer. The
chair was taken by the Rev. Mr. Griffiths, and the
proceedings commenced by singing an anthem, after
which the Rev. Mr. Green offered np a suitable prayer.
The first resolution was moved by the Rev. J. Beazley,
viz., ""That this meeting, feeling the importance of
religious ordinances as-a means for the promotion of
the welfare of any people, hereby records its gratitude
to God that this privilege, through the agency
of the Colonial Missionary Society, has been
secured lo them in connection with this place.""
The Rev. Mr. Woolnough seconded the motion, which
was carried unanimously. The second resolution was
proposed by the Rev. Mr. Green :-"" That, recognis-
ing the justice of the Apostle's statement, that they
who preach the gospel should live by the gospel, this
meeting pledges itself to use every exertion for the
support of the ministration of the gospel within this
place."" Haying been duly seconded by the Rev. W.
Cuthbertson, the resolution was carried unanimously.
The third resolution was proposed by the Rev. W.
Chaucer :-"" That, in the interval during which there
may be no settled pastor to this church, this meeting
is sensible of the importance of its members being
united, that they may be prepared to co-operate with
a minister so soon as it is possible one shall be ap
poined."" Mr. Webster said that he had pleasure in
seconding the resolution, and that as a member of that
congregation he viewed with pleasure the presence of
the reverend gentlemen of other denominations who
had met on the platform that evening. The chairman,
in putting the resolution, which was unanimously
carried, said that he hoped the members of the con-
gregation would henceforth resolve to live in unity and
to be as one. After a concluding anthem, ond a col-
lection, which amounted to £15, the meeting closed.
A Squatter Committed for Trial for Shem
Stealing.-At the Robe Town Local Court, a squatter
was committed for trial for sheep stealing on Monday
last. The circumstances were as follows :-For some
time past the neighbours of the prisoner kept missing
sheep from off their runs, and never could hear any
tidings of them after. A Mr. Alexander M'Arthur
(Tatiara) having missed a small flock that were feeding
near the home station the evening previously, went in
search of them. After following the tracks for some
time, he found that they had been driven forward by a
horseman who had burned the scrub on either side to
hide the tracks. Following up the burnt scrub, he
came to the home station of his kind neighbour, where
he found the sheep yarded, haying just submitted to
the process of haying the ear marks and brands re-
moved ; knowing by the fire brands that the sheep
were his, Mr. M'Arthur went immedia'ely for the
police, and gave the squatter into custody. A lubra
on the station stated that her master had just returned
with the sheep, end hod informed the servants about
that he had bought them. As the evidence was very
conclusive, the prisoner was fully committed.
Coroner's Inquest.-An inquest, on view of the
body of Philip Steer, aged 42 years, was held on
Friday last, at the Five Dock Hotel. Deceased had
been landlord of the Edinburgh Castle, Pitt and
Bathurst streets, for some time, and it appeared he
felt aotitely the evil effects upon his constitution of an
inordinate recourse to drink to which his social habits
subjected him, aggravated as they were by inactive
physical habits. For change of air, and a resort to
healthy exercise of his frame, with a view to improved
health, ho paid a visit to an acquaintance at Five
Dock1 on Monday last. On Wednesday evening,
a change of an alarming character took
place in him, and his faculties beoame
seriously impaired. He was attended to
duting the night. He got up at four o'clock the next
morning, dressed himself, and went out over a fence
into the adjacent bush ground, where he kept wander-
ing about, under surveillance, till his aberration in-
creasing, he was got hold of ; whereupon he asked to
kneel, and presently fell back and expired. The
opinion given on medical evidence was that serous
apoplexy had supervened upon delirium tremen». The
jury returned a verdiot of died from exhaustion,
brought on by acts of intemperance.
Newtown and Cook's River Road Trust. - A
meeting of a large body of the electors was held at
Mr. Richardson's, White Horse Tavern, Newtown, on
Saturday evening. The chair was taken by Mr.
Edward* Raper. The meeting having been addressed
by Messrs, T. J. Bown, William Jolly, and John Lucas,
(who are candidates for the trusteeship) it was proposed
and seconded that Mr. T. J. Bown was fully qualified
to fill the office of trustee. An amendment was then
made in favour of the present trustees, which, having
been put to the meeting, was negatived by a large
majority. The original proposition was then put, and
the show of hands resulted in a majority in Mr. Bown's
favour. Mr. Jolly was then proposed, seconded, and a
show of hands called for, which proved to be unani-
mously in that gentleman's favour. Mr. J. Lucas
behg then proposed and seconded, a show of hands
was called, which gave that gentleman a large ma
jority. Messrs. Gannon and Terry were then pro-
posed, and the show of hands resulted in their favour.
The_ merits and demerits of the different candidates
having been fully disenssed, and a vote of thanks
given to the chairman, the meeting broke un.
The Alpacas.-The following letter from Mr. E. L.
Montefiore, to the editor of the Argus, appeared in that
paper on Monday last, the 22dd instant:-""I am
desirous (he says), of drawing the special attention of
the public to the flock of alpacas, &c, shortly expected,
with a view to some steps being taken to secure it, or
a portion of it, for this colony. Its first destination is
Sydney, and should sufficient inducement offer, the
whole flock will be sold there. The flock shipped at
Caldera consists of 9 vicunas, 60 guarizos, 130 alpacas,
and 161 llamas. How many of these will reach their
destination it is impossible to say. They are the
produce of stock collected five years back in Bolivia,
taken from there into the Argentine Republic, thence
over the Andes to Chili. The party in charge of the
flock was pursued by the authorities of Bolivia, and
had great difficulty in getting the flock safe within the
boundaries of the Argentine Republic ; and, as rauch
greater vigilance is uuw used, it is probable that many
years will elapse ere another flock will find its way to
these shores. As an old Peruvian correctly stated in
your columns of 14th October, the llamas-a flock of
which has been secured for this colony by Mr. West-
garth-are chiefly used in Peru as beasts of burden.
Their wool is very inferior to that of the alpaca or
vicuna. They, however, make an excellent oross with
the alpaca, producing a hybrid known as the guariro,
which yields as fine wool, but longer in staple and of
greater weight than the alpaca alone. The wool
produced by the vicuna is shorter, but much finer, than
that of the alpaca or guarizo. The paco vicuna, or
hybrid between vicuna and alpaca, is of great value.
Its wool possesses the fineness of the former combined
with length of staple of the latter. I shall be happy
to show specimens of the alpaca wool to parties in-
terested. A very interesting aeconnt of the above
animait may befseen at the public library in ' Bischoff""«

ZoorHTTEs.-Mr. G. A. Adams, M.D., writing from
Indented Heads, says :-"" Some time «ince I found a
beautiful and very singularly formed zoophyte on a
sand-bank in the interior. I observed what I at first
sight fancied to he a pretty crimson flower in a crushed
state, and stooping to pick it np, I immediately per-
ceived it to belong to the animal, instead of the vege-
table kingdom ; and inserting my fingers into the sand,
I brought up the body of the zoophyte, which is of a
pyriform or almost conical shape, covered exteriorly by
a fishy-like capsular membrane ; then interiorly the
cavity is partially filled by a congeries of tubes of a
purple colour, and five of those tubes rose up above
ground about an inch, and were all joined together at
their summits by a ruby-coloured reticulated substance,
forming what appeared like a beautiful flower. The
tubular structure had the appearance of small traoheas
or the lesser bronchio, but of course the annular tissue
totally different. The tubes were of diameter sufficient
to admit a small quill, and proceeded upwards from
the base of the cone, the apex pointing downwards.
Another zoophyte, and a very extraordinary fish I shall
describe in my next communication.""-Argus,
Auctioneers.-Messrs. Peden and Lucas sat on
Saturday morning to grant auctioneers' licenses. Some

glected this, their Worships adjourned until 10 o'clock

SIB,-The question mooted by Angltcnnus in your
issue of yesterday (July 15th), is an exceedingly grave
, one, and our minds ought at once to be set at rest upon
?f tHe matter.
""'- ' í'I believe it will be inferred from the fact that the
Bishop of Melbourne has nominated a Dean of Mel-
bourne, that letters patent have vested the patronage
- «f cathedral benefices.in colonial bishopB. And yet,
Sir. it is hardly to be conceived that such power, Buch
influence, such autocracy, should be vouchsafed to co-
lonial bishops, and be denied to Bindiar ecclesiastical
dignitaries at home. Surely a colonial bishopric would
not be at so great H discount with the elite of the Eng.
_ lish clergy. I remember how earnestly the late Arch
' f deacon of Cumberland used to deprecate the removal
of our Australian Church from under the protecting
-wing of Her Britannic Majesty, and certainly our
Anglican Church ought net to be de-nationalized h°re
- because she has cent her missionaries to her colonial
dependencies.
The nominee of Dr. Barker will be as truly the very
'.Rec. as is any Denn in our home-land; bnt only be-
cause he is the most excellent and laborious
clergyman, Rev. W. M. Cowper. To honour
such a divine at such a time as the pre-
sent -were a most fitting tribute to the me-
mory of his venerated father ; hut would not the fami-
liar title of Archdeacon Cowper have been as grace-
ful and less queationable !
Some might demur that a dignity in the Northern
Diocese, where Mr. Cowper has so long and so suc-
cessfully laboured, would have been more becoming ;
but the clergy of the Diocese of Sydney are superior
to all petty jealousies of strangers, andmon cheeifully
, accord honour where honour is so justly due. The
Bishop of Sydney must be admitted to he the most
competent judge of the merits and claims of his own
clergy.
Another question suggests itself, Does not the nomi
0 nation of the incumbent of St. Philip's to the Deanery
of St. Andrew's imply a plurality of benefices be
r Tstowed npon one individual ? When the temporary
í (' chapel of St. Andrew's shall he transported, on the
' ; completion of its more graceful neighbour, will the in
, ;. cumbency of St. Andrew's be transferred with it ?
,u > Not a few of your readers deem these seeming trifles
' to be matters of deepest moment ; and this considera

300 of them bud recently gone dow n to the Rocky

In îefeieitce to the case of the Brisbane Customs
authorities v ersus the captain of the British Empire,
the r>ce l'tcss savs that the Executive, by advice of
the Crown luv olhcDis, have decided upon reversing
the decision ol the bench of magistrates here, refund-
ing the fine, and repumanding the tide-surveyor who
went on boaid before the vessel was yisited bj the
health ofhcci I am not in a position to gum anteo
the nccuiacy of this statement, and can only saj that,
if the Executive have already arrived at a decision in
the case, they hay e acted more promptly than is their
wont At any i itc, no reply has yet arrived to a
memorial to his Excellency on the subject, adopted at
a public meeting
At a meeting of the Moleton Bay Building Society,
held last week, the money borrowed was at the nte of
11J j)er cent per annum This shows a great i educ-
tion fiom the rates of a year or two ago which ranged
from IS to 22 poi cent The branches of the tTiuou
and New South Wales Banks established lune have
taken off one per cent rospear.olj O l bills of tlueé,

Some time ago application wag made to have the
hard labour prisoners confined in Brisbane gaol em-
ployed in draining an unsightly and unwholesome
swamp, situated in the town, in terms of a late Act of
the Legislature. The Executive, after making en-
quiries on the subject, concluded to refuse
the application, on the ground that even ,if
it were desirable that the work should be
undertaken by the Government the expense of pro-
viding a guard would be considerable. The Executive,
no doubt, were guided by information derived from
the local authorities, and had these gentlemen exer-
cised a little fertility of invention, I have no doubt
they could have procured a guard at no great cost. In
the meantime the swamp remains undramed, to the
manifest injury of the public health, and the hard
labour prisoners are left without undergoing the most
efficient portion of their punishment.
There was lately another deplorable case
of death from intoxication. Two men, while
looking for horses, found the dead body
of a man named John Young lying in tho
bush nt a place called the Coffin Holes. The men
proceeded to Ipswich, and gave information to the
Chief Constable, and an inquiry yvas subsequently
held. The body yvas in an advanced stage of decom-
position, and the medical gentleman who examined it
was unable to discover any disease or injury; but,
from all the circumstances, he was of opinion that
death was caused by intoxication and exposure to the
sun. The deceased was last seen alive near the place
where Ids body was found. He was then very much
intoxicated, mid, besides other causes of death, it, is
probable he might haye sustnmed injury by a fall
from his horse.
The mnil for England by the Gladiolus closes to
moirovv, and she will therefore sail in a day or two,
no doubt. She will be succeeded on the berth by the
British Empire. The Navarino, from London, also to
be laid on to load direct, has not arrived, although
fully due.
There is a large quantity of wool at tho stores, and
i it will no doubt accumulate for some time to come if
the weather remain fine.
In reply to a petition from graziers and others resi-
ding to the southward of the Condamine river,
forwarded by Mr. Hodgson, a communication has been
received from the Department of Land and Public
""Works, that a sum of money will be placed
I on the Estimates for next session, for the
purpose of erecting a bridge over the above river at
Ellangowan, and that in the meantime the district
surveyor will bo instructed to rcpoit on the subject as
to the probable expense, &c. The passage of the Cor
daminc has always been a great delny to the traffic
to and from the south, and a substantial bridge or
two across the stream would bo an immense public
benefit.
The schooner Vanquish, which lately brought a
cargo of wheat from Adelaide for Mr. Fleming, will
return for another, taking with her as freight a cargo
of coal from the mines of Messrs. Campbell and Co.,
of Redbank. The above firm have obtained the con-
tract for supplying the A. S. N. Company's vessels
with coal during the current year. The price is 10s.
per ton delivered at the pit's mouth, and 15s. per ton
delivered at the company's depot, or on board any of
their vessels at Brisbane.
The following is from the ATorth Auitralian of this
day :-"" AIr._ Kennedy's station of Tierriboo has been
sold for £35,000 ; and we hear of Tarampa having
changed hands for £18,000 to Air. Forbes.-Broughton
and Fattorini report the sale of 4500 mixed ewes, from

TO THE INHABITANTS of SYDNEY and NEW
SOUTH WALES.-Tho difficulty or obtaining TEA
of really fino quality has been long felt by everyone who
can appreciate the luxury. In catering for tho pnblio in
this indispensable article of daily consumption, S. Bonnott
and Co. have found, during tliolr experience as tea dealers
in this city, that teas of medium (ino quality aro rarely
Imported, - tho liest nover ! The reason assigned by
merchants is that they cannot obtain remunerativo prices
for outlay of capital. Such being tho facts, S. B. and Co.
having determined to establish a name in this country for
tho sale of a superior quality of tea, at their own risk and
cost, have made arrangements with tho well-known ten
merchants, Messrs. Brown and Co., Spring-street, for the
exclusivo importation of a regular supply of such tea as
S. B. and Co. know (from long experience as tea dealers in
tho west of England und somo of the first establishments
in London) will suit tho tastes of all consumers, but of con-
noisseurs particularly. And they now have the pleasure of
announcing to their friends and tho public generally that
the first parcel of this tea has arrived per Atalanta, and
is, without exception, the finest everofl'ered In this country .
it requires no mixing, being of itself a combination ofgro.it
strength, with fino pokoo souchong flavour. Large con- |
sumer« will find this to be tho most economical ten, one
half tho quantity being sufficient to produco a better infu-
sion than tho tea generally sold. The truth of these as-
sertions may bo easily proved by a trial, which is rospect
fully solicited by
S. BENNETT and CO., 482, George-street, opposite
the Markets.
IIB A.-Tho most choice and superlativo mixturo of

PÄNY fearlessly assert they aro Boiling at tho present
timo TeaR of a character nover surpassed in the colony of
Now South Wales. Tho peculiar blending of certain pro-
portions of the finest of tho present season's growth pro-
duces a beverage remarkable for its richness and fino deli-
cate flavour ; the prico being moderate, viz., 2s. 6d. per lb.,
places it in tho roach of all classes.

of this Tea is in tho adinixtiiro. Tho know ledge of tho
quality that each variety possesses, with a judicious
blending of the same', lias enabled Hanks and Company to
surmount ii dillicultv generally felt in Sydney to obtain
this article in as high ii state of perfection as in England ;
knowing that nothing can burpa-s this supc
llor article, they with confidence recommend it to the

THE COUNCIL.
On Thursday, 13th October, the Council sat but a
short time,—the notice of motion by Mr. JOHNSON,
relative to the dismemberment of the colony by the
erection of the proposed new colony of Queensland,
having been postponed, in consequence of its being
impossible that the result of the debate could be
communicated to her Majesty's Government in Eng-
land by the present mail.
Notices were given of four new bills,—First, by the
SOLICITOR-GENERAL, of a bill to facilitate the transfer
of lands, and a bill to amend the District Courts Act ;
second, by Mr. BLAKE, of a bill to assimilate the law
of divoice in this colony to that of England ; and,
third, by Dr. DICKSON, of a bill to legalise a transfer
of certain property, which is rendered necessary by the
erection of Waverley into a municipality.'
Copy of the commission by which Mr. Justice
Lutwyche was appointed a Judge of the Supreme
Court of New South Wales and Resident Judge of
Moreton Bay was laid upon the table and ordered to
be printed. The SOLICITOR-GENERAL stated that
there could, in his opinion, be no doubt that under
this edict ?on, Mr. Justice Lutwyche might at any
time take his seat as one of the Judges of the Supreme
Court in Sydney.
A petition was presented from Windsor, depre-
cating the withdrawal of State-aid from the churches
of the colony ; also a petition against the Medical
Bill.
A select committee was appointed, on Mr. Johnson's
motion, io inquire into the system of registration of
deeds , and the Church of England Synod Bill was
referred to a select committee, on the motion of Mr.
DEAS THOMPSON, without any discussion.
On Wednesday, 19th, a petition was presented by
Mr. Eagar from the Rev. Dr. Woolley against the
Church of England Synods Bill. Another petition
was presented by Mr. MORTON from eighty-two re-
sidents in the district of Hartley, praying the Council
to refuse to assent to the withdrawal of State-aid
from religion and Dr. DOUGLASS presented a petition
to the same edect from forty-five of the residents of
St. John's, Camden. A petition was also presented
by Dr. John Douglass from medical practitioners resident
in M? and its neighbourhood, in favour of the
passing of the Medical Bill.
In answer to questions put by Mr. ISAACS in refer-
ence to the dismissal of the late Crown Solicitors, and
to the ?ation of their offices, and as to the
number of respective salaries of the clerks formerly
employed under the Civil and Criminal Crown
Solicitor, and the number now employed in the Crown
Solicitor's office, the SOLICITOR-GENERAL, laid returns
upon the table giving all the information required, and
obtained leave for the printing thereof.
The SOLICITOR-GENERAL also laid upon the table,
in immediate reply to addresses already agreed to,
copies of the letters patent appointing the Bishops of
Sydney and Newcastle ; and copies of letter of resig-
nation sent by Mr. Justice Milford in the months of
January and February last, together with the opinions
of the Law Officers of the Crown touching such resig-
nation. The first mentioned papers were referred to
the select committee on the Church of England Synods
Bill. The second series were required for the purposes
of the debate on Moreton Bay Separation, and par-
ticularly with reference to the administration of justice
in the proposed new colony.
The SOLICITOR-GENERAL introduced his new bill to
provide for the transfer of lands. Some of the objects
of the bill were stated. The scope of its operation
was intended to be confined to transfers of real pro-
perty granted after 1st January, 1860, leaving all old
titles in the same state as at present.
The bill was condemned by Mr. DEAS THOMSON, as
altogether insufficient for any good purpose, as a
general measure, although it might be an useful addi-
tion to the information to be considered by the select
committee. Mr. WISE also objected to the measure
that it was insufficient. Mr. BLAKE spoke in favour
of the adoption of the principle of the Encumbered
Estates Act of Ireland.
Mr. JOHNSON, Mr. NORTON, the PRESIDENT, and Mr.
HOLDEN were all of opinion that the bill proposed
should be referred to the select committee, from whom
only, after mature consideration, a satisfactory mea-
sure could be expected ; and Mr. JONES was in favour
of passing the Solicitor-General's bill, retaining it as
a separate measure for new titles, leaving those
already existing to be dealt with under some other
measure.
Mr. JOHNSON brought forward his motion "" That in
the opinion of this Council the proposed dismemberment
of New South Wales, by the creation of a new colony
to the northward, called Queensland, is, under present
circumstances, impolitic, inexpedient, illegal, and
unjust He reviewed the whole of the proceedings
in reference to this separation, from 1850 to the pre-
sent time ; urging that the advocates of the move-
ment had all along had in view the introduction into
the proposed new colony of convict labour in some
shape or other, notwithstanding that the vast majority
of the inhabitants of the whole territory had em-
phatically declared against it ; that they had shown
that they were not ripe for separation, as
they admitted throughout that they would be
unable to bear the expenses of self-
government, but would require assistance
from Imperial funds ; and further, that they had not
the means of self-government under free institutions,
but were only prepared for a nominee Legislature.
He maintained that the dismemberment was illegal,
as the Queen had no power to interfere with lands to
the southward of the 26th degree of south latitude ;
and further quoted the opinions of the law officers of
England on the subject, more especially as it related
to the debt which had been incurred on the se-
curity of the lands of the colony. The
hon. member's address was made up
to a considerable extent of extracts from parliamen-
tary papers, and at its conclusion he expressed a hope
that, after the manner in which this colony had been
treated, notwithstanding the repeated remonstrances
which had been sent home against such separation,
this Council would not be found very ready to pass
the measures that must be passed before the dismem-
berment could be completed.
The debate was adjourned at the close of Mr. John-
son's address.
On Thursday, 20th, the Council met at ten minutes
past four, but only to receive the announcement made
by the SOLICITOR-GENERAL that the Ministry had
resigned, and that he and his colleagues only held
office until their successors were appointed.
Mr. EAGAR made a strenuous effort to induce the
House to receive a petition from five clergymen and
eighty laymen of the Church of England in opposition
to the Church of England Synods Bill, but the pro-
posal was not entertained.
On Wednesday, 20th, Mr. EAGAR announced that a
new Ministry had been formed ; that he had himself
accepted office ; but that the members of the Cabinet
had not been sworn in ; and, stating that the Assembly
had adjourned to Tuesday, the 29th, he asked the
Council to adjourn to Wednesday, the 30th Novem-
ber.
Mr. JOHNSON opposed the adjournment, maintain-
ing that it was of the utmost importance that no such
delay should take place in the debate upon the More-
ton Bay Resolutions, as if they were further post-
poned for a month, the Governor would arrive, the
proclamations be issued, and the dismemberment
effected before the Council had an opportunity of ex-
pressing its opinion. And such a course, it was con-
tended, was the more objectionable as the delays
which had already taken place had been from adjourn-
ments agreed to time after time to suit the convenience
of the late Government.
Mr. ISAACS supported this view of the question,
by moving an amendment that the House adjourn
for a week, in order to give Ministers an opportunity
of conferring upon the subject, when it might be dis-
cussed, and, a decision having been arrived at, the
House might adjourn to 30th November.
The PRESIDENT, Mr. DEAS THOMSON, Dr. DICK-
SON—all maintained that it was the constant practice
of the House of Lords to adjourn at the same time as
the House of Commons under such circumstances ;
consequently that the Council ought not to sit during
the recess of the other House.
The question having been put on the amendment, it
was negatived on division by a majority of 10 to 5,
and the Council adjourned to the 30th November ac-
cordingly.
Mr. Wise took his seat next to Mr. Eagar, on the
Government side, and the late Solicitor-General sat
on the same side.
Mr. Wise's acceptance of office was alluded to by
Mr, ISAACS as a matter of congratulation.",The Sydney Morning Herald ,"815,166,321,815,858,860,859,859,859,855,398,821,857,852,857,856,853,858,661,819,860,861,855,861,862,861,862,273,821,859,859,71,821,863,861,858,642,818,861,859,860,861,862,862,863,862,864,862,438,823,861,862,861,865,859,858,860,613,821,860,861,855,864,857,856,857,858,859,855,863,446,824,858,861,912,860,579,824,861,865,863,860,862,862,370,821,864,860,856,859,861,854,854,140,823,861,860,859,856,861,858,871,858,858,860,857,859,857,857,845,855,858,854,856,857,855,857,860,859,843,860,859,853,857,860,859,854,860,854,457,822,213,818,858,856,859,687,828,860,858,857,409,817,862,856,860,857,842,56,823,856,854,852,854,854,852,851,852,850,852,376,818,868,854,856,854,651,820,857,854,853,884,468,823,862,841,877,822,859,251,827,650",Sat 12 Nov 1859,"357,423,468,512,547,576,617,651,686,720,755,788,823,857,893,927,961,996,1030,1065,1099,1134,1169,1205,1239,1274,1309,1343,1380,1413,1448,1482,1518,1552,1587,1623,1656,1705,1739,1774,1811,1843,1880,1913,1949,1982,2017,2052,2087,2122,2158,2191,2226,2261,2295,2329,2366,2399,2433,2469,2504,2538,2575,2604,2643,2678,2712,2747,2782,2816,2851,2885,2921,2955,2990,3026,3060,3094,3125,3165,3199,3234,3268,3303,3337,3372,3407,3442,3477,3512,3546,3582,3616,3659,3685,3720,3755,3784,3824,3858,3893,3927,3962,3997,4032,4066,4101,4136,4170,4205,4239,4274,4309,4344,4379,4413,4448,4482,4518,4553,4586,4617,4656,4691,4726,4761,4795,4830,4865,4901,4934,4971,5020,5055,5089,5124,5158,5193,5228,5263,5297,5332,5383,5417,5452,5487,5522,5557,5600,5626,5661,5696,5731,5766,5800,5835,5864,5904,5939,5974,6007,6043,6078,6113,6148,6183,6218,6252,6287,6322,6357,6391,6426,6461,6495,6530,6564,6599,6634,6671,6703,6738","542,796,785,562,516,516,514,515,515,517,514,551,516,518,515,515,513,514,514,552,512,514,512,510,511,512,511,515,550,514,514,516,552,514,513,512,514,557,513,516,512,514,513,513,513,514,511,513,514,550,514,514,511,510,515,515,514,515,549,511,515,515,511,514,514,512,512,512,513,510,513,548,514,511,459,512,512,547,511,506,511,512,509,510,510,548,506,511,510,510,507,514,511,510,545,507,509,511,512,507,509,507,509,509,507,507,507,508,508,508,509,507,507,506,505,508,505,507,506,505,504,505,506,504,505,504,505,504,504,505,539,504,545,506,508,505,506,535,504,504,503,502,545,503,504,502,503,502,504,535,501,502,502,502,502,501,503,503,502,503,502,536,489,503,499,502,497,535,501,503,503,473,505,536,497,504,503,540,505,520,537,502",13033099,Page 6

THURSDAY.
Before the Mayor, Mr. Lenehan, Mr. Burdekin, Mr,
Asher, Mr. Spence, Mr. Lucas.
Seven persons were convicted of having been found
drunk in the streets : one was sentenced to be im-
prisoned three months, two to pay 20s. each or to be
imprisoned forty-eight hours, and the rest to pay 20s.
each or to be imprisoned twenty-four hours.
Charles Moore was charged with having, on Satur-
day last, stolen from the bar of Mr. Jones's public-
house, Woolloomooloo, a box containing about £7, in
notes and coin ; /when apprehended he had 35s. in
silver about him ; he denied having any knowledge of
the robbery. Isabella Jones, of Palmer-street,
publican, deposed, that between eleven and twelve
o'clock on last Saturday forenoon prisoner came to
her house, and sat in the bar until some time after
two ; he said that he was on his way to Watson's
Bay, and was waiting the arrival of the steamer at the
wharf; when she went to dinner she left him in the
bar ; but a few minuses had elapsed before she was
called into the bar to serve a customer ; she missed from
under the counter a small box, in which she had left
three £1 notes, £1 10s. in gold, two papers, each
containing 20s. in silver, and about 10s. loose silver ;
prisoner also was gone ; she had neither seen nor
heard any other person in the bar since she saw the
box and money ; prisoner said that he was in the
employ of Mr. Jenkins, of Watson's Bay; to two
men who had treated him he apologised for not re-
turning the compliment by stating that he had no
money. Mrs. Jenkins, of Watson's Bay, deposed
that she had not seen prisoner at her house since
Thursday evening ; she, however, had a good opinion
of his honesty from the fact that he found and re-
turned to her a valuable brooch which she had lost.
Committed for trial at the Quarter Sessions.
Patrick Murray was charged by inspector Taylor
on suspicion of having stolen twelve brushes, which
he (Mr, Taylor) had received from Charles Aaron.
Charles Aaron, of Kent-street, pawnbroker, deposed
that last night prisoner brought him the dozen of
brushes produced, and wanted the loan of 6s. upon
them; suspected that he had stolen them, but wanted
to ascertain if another man, then present, was an ac-
complice; for this purpose he lent prisoner
1s.; the other man went away altogether, and
the prisoner made straight for a public-house ;
followed him quickly, and before he had
parted with the shilling entered into conversa-
tion with him ; asked him if he had not given him a
sovereign instead of a shilling ; to satisfy him that no
such mistake had been made, prisoner showed him
the shilling, of which he (witness) took possession,
and handed the prisoner and the. brushes into the
custody of inspector Taylor, on suspicion of having
stolen them. Not being able to satisfy the Bench how
he became possessed of the brushes, Murray (who is
a known thief) was sentenced to be imprisoned three
calendar months.
Charles Hunter was charged by Martha, his wife,
with leaving her and three children without
the means of support. He left her at Parramatta
about seven weeks since to come to Sydney (as he
said) for work ; hearing nothing of him, she came to
Sydney and proceeded thence to Maitland, where she
found him ; when at work, he earned £3 to £3 10s. a
week by his trade of cabinet maker. In reply, he said
that he should have had no need to leave Parramatta
for want of work but for the quantity of furniture Im-
ported into the country. To pay 25s. a week for
twelve months.
Andrew Byrne was brought before the Court
by Sergeant Lee for having assaulted a man
of colour in the Cattle Market, knocking him
down by a violent blow on the head with a stick. The
black man was drunk. To pay a penalty of 40s., or
to be imprisoned three days.
Michael Connell, a private of the 12th, charged
with having while drunk assaulted Constable M'Kay
and torn his uniform, was remanded to the Military
authorities.
Thomas Page, publican, found guilty of having
kept open his house for the sale of liquor on Sunday,
was sentenced to pay a penalty of 20s. and costs.
Thomas Jarrett, John O'Brien, and Thomas Birch,
for similar offences (having pleaded guilty), were
severally sentenced to pay 10s. and cost's. John
O'Brien was also convicted of having, on Sunday, the
26th February, refused and neglected to admit into
his house a sergeant of police when thereto required,
for which offence he was sentenced to pay a penalty
of £3 and costs.

I -'BRITISH STORMS. . .
ADMIRAL FITZROV read a paper on British Storms,
which was illustrated with a number of large dia-
grams prepared by Mr. Babington, of Cambridge. It
is well known that no year passed in which the
British islands were not visited by storms, and that
they varied in degree of force from, what seamen call
a gale, to a hurricane in its violence. Only of late
years, however, had it been supposed, and but
recently proved, that nearly all, if not indeed the
whole, of these remarkable tempests by which a very
notable amount of injury was done, had
been so much alike in character, and hal
been preceded by such similar warnings, as
to warrant our reasoning inductively from their well
asceitained facts, and thence deducing laws. Every-
one looked back to some extraordinary storm as ex-
ceeding all others in his lifetime ; but a tempest that;
was severely felt in one part of the country waa not
always extensive, but usually the reverse, more oc '
less limited in area, varying in range, direction, and
force. After noticing the storm described by De Po»
in 1703, he referred io the Royal Charter gale of
October last. The storm of the 25th of October did
not come from the west, but the south-west, and had
been traced across the Bay of Biscay, over England
from the Channel through Cornwall, and through the
north sea between the Shetland Islands and Norway.
The maximum ' velocity of the wind was frora
CO to 100 miles an Tiour, while at a distance of 20»
to 50 miles there was a comparative lull. It waa
very remarkable that from the 25th to the 27th, being
two complete davs, on the west coast of Ireland they
had light winds,""while in the British Channel it blew
a northerly gale. On the Galway and Limerick coast
there were light winds, while over England the wind
was passing in a tempest from all points of the com-
pass. The succeeding storm of the let and 2nd o£
November was then described, which was in all
respects like that usually called the Charter gale,
excepting that it came more from the westward,
passed across the north of Ireland, the Isle of Man,
and then, went off up the Channel, and eastward to
the coast of Holland. Some of the signs which pre-
ceded the Chatter gale were described. For a few
days previously the thermometer was exceedingly low
i in a great part of the country ; there were north winds
in some places, a good deal of snow, nothing
very violent ; but a great deal of high wind came
afterwards exceedingly dry and hot. Many detailed
i particulars of this storm were glanced at, and he
noticed, in passing, the extraordinary storm in
, ""Wiltshire described -by Mr. Rowell, of Oxford, by
which a wheelbarrow was actually lifted from the
road and hurled over a hedge. After referring to the
theory of parallel currents,-the great polar current
coming from the north and east in one direction -fchLle
a current from the tropical regions was coming ia
another direction-he narrated the arrangements
made by the Government for the daily transmission of
meteorological information between- London- and
Paris, the results of five subsidiary communications
from thirteen stations in the ""United> .Kingdom.
Admiral Moorsom made a few observations corrobo-
rative of the view s advanced by Admiral Fitzroy, to
whom a vote of thanks was"" passed for his able
paper.
MARR.INO TOR LOVB.-The member of the house
of O'Brien, to -whom was confided the education of
the scion of the Desmonds, was now Prince of Tho
mond. It is not unreasonable to presume that it ia
to this fosterage and education of James Fitzgerald
1 in Thomond the posterity of Torlogh Mael were in-
debted for the grant of lands in the county of Water
'ford; and John Fitzgerald, the elder brother of
I James, having, shortly after his accession to the earl..
j dom, been accidentally drowned in the river Suir,
I while pursuing a party of the Butlers, the title des
i cendea to his son Thomas, then advancing to man
' hood. The Four Masters place in the year 1-11 the
banishment of this young nobleman by his uncle Jamos,
son of Garret or Gerald, the ward of the O'Briens,
without, however, assigning any reasons for this revo-
lution in the family of the Geraldines of Munster. The
romantic incident, however, is sufficiently authen-
ticated, which informs us that Thomas, the young
Earl, while pursuing the chase in the neighbourhood
of Abbeyfeele, was benighted and obliged to beg a
shelter in the house of a person named MacCormac,
who happened to be a tenant on the Desmond estates.
That Catherine, the beautiful and virtuous daughter
of the retainer, inspired the young lord with such a
passion, as led, when it could not otherwise be gra-
tified, to an offer to share with her his rank and for-
tune. This mesalliance, we are informed, so incensed
the barbarous followers of the house of Desmond,
that the young lord and his beautiful, though humble
countess, were banished from the territory, and the
allegiance of the Geraldines transferred to James,
the uncle, who had influence enough to attain the
object of his ambition, in procuring an Act of Par-
liament, by which the estates and dignity were con-
firmed to him and his heirs.-Historical Memoir of
the O'Brien».
THE MANDAN INDIANS.-According to their tradi-
tion, they were the first people created by the Great
Spirit. In the beginning they lived in the centre of
the earth, where they cultivated vinesj a shoot from
one of which, having found an opening, grew up to
, the surface of the earth. One of the young mea
of the tribe climbed up the stem of the vine, and ar-
rived at the spot where the Mandan village actually
stands. Perceiving the fertility of the soil and the
abundance of buffaloes in the neighbouring prairies,
he killed several of these animals and descended again
to inform his companions of what he had seen,
whereupon, a multitude of them climbed up
after him. Among them were two young
and beautiful girls, who were much.-,
esteemed by the chiefs and warriors because
they were virgins. There was also a woman, very
fat and heavy, whom the others would not allow to
mount ; but as she was very inquisitive, she took ad-
vantage of a moment when Bhe was left alone to climb
up in her turn ; the vine broke down under her

A DEGRADED IMPOSTER.-Looking at a man who
says he is forty-three when in fact he is above sixty, I,
suspect him all over. I am in doubt whether his ¿air,
his teeth, his eyes are real, I do noUcnow whether
that breadth of chest be the devolopement of manly
bone and muscle, or the skilful padding of the tailor.
I am not sure how much is the-man, and how much
the work of his valetTT rsusnecOhat his whiskers
and moustache are dyed. -1 look at1 his tight boots,
and think how they miut be tormenting his poor old
corny feet. I admire his affected buoyancy of manner,
and think how the miserable creature must collapse
when he finds himself alone, and is no longer com-
pelled by the presence of company to put himself on.
the stretch, and carry on that wretched acting. When
I see the old reptile whispering in a comer to a girl of
eighteen, or furtively squeezing her in a waltz, I
should like extremely to take him by the neck and
shake him till he came into the pieces of which he is
made up. And when I have heard (long ago) such an
one with a hideous gloating relish, telling a profane
or indecent story ; or instilling cynical and impious ^
notions of life and things into the minds of young ;
lads ; or, more disgusting still, using phrases of
double meaning in the presence of innocent young
women, and enjoying their innocent ignorance of his
cense-I have thought that I was beholding as degra-
ded a phase of human nature as you will find on the
face of this sinful world. Oh, venerable age ?-grey
wise, kindly sympathetic !-befóte which Ishall neve
cease reverently to bend, respecting even what I may
(wrongly, perhaps) esteem your prejudices, that you
should be caricatured and degraded in that foul old
leering satyr ! And if there be a thing on earth that
disgusts one more than even the thought of the
animal himself, it is to think of ministers ofic\i""ion
(prudently pious) who will wait meekly in his ante-
chamber and sit humbly at his table, because he is an
earl or duke ! -Frazers Mugazme,

OK Wednesday evening a meeting of the electora of Paddington
waa held nt ibo "".Royal Oak,"" Kedfirn, to eecure tho election or
Aldnman Sutherland. The room ras orowded to execa». Mr.
Halt, tbe lau candidate, «as present
Mr. CHISPIE having been voted to the chair, opened the pro-
ceedings by rtndicg the advertisement, and called upon the can-
didate to addrcsB the meeting.
Mr. &LTHEULAND, umid cheers, proceeded to comment upjn the
Land Bill, the Municipalise Act, Internal communication, prison
discipline, and other matlirr, and at the end of hi» address
answered several questions put to bim by the electors to the salls
fuctiun of the meeting.
Mr. WOOD- moved and Mr. NhivsiAH seconded a rcaolutlon that
Mr. Bu'btrlaiid waBbflt and proper peraou toreprcBeut Ihe clco
tui ate, which was carried without dissent.
Mr. HAUT, who on rising waa received with enthusiastic
cheero, tah! tbut bifore tbe buslneaa terminated bo begged Ino
inrttilfcenceuflhe meeting to answer a cowardly attack lhat had
been ruade upon bim ut a meeting the night before by a per so a
named Smith ; and also to make a few remarks respecting bia re-
tirement aa a candidate, and he would touob upon the last Bubjcct
first. PeihopB, it would have saved him a great deal of annoy
ar cear.d prevented« miaundcretanding wlib tbe elcotorsif, In
stCLd of atnding a note to tbe meeting, ho had gone personally ;
but, having wl bdrawn from tho contest, he thougat
li would have bein qui e sufficient. However, an
attack having been ni ade upon him, he felt
bia duty to meet the electora face to face, and refuto the falso
calumny that had been uttered. (Cheers ) Mr. Hart then pro-
ceeded to ttute that after the dissolution of Parliament, finding
tbut it would involve considerable inconvenience and expense to
him to viril hlB former eonatituency, he Bought one nearer his
borne, ord being personally acquainted with u great number of
tbe influential electors of Paddington, and having an unanimity
of sentiment with them in political matters, he resolved to stand
fur thai eonatituency. At the comincncenent of the eleotioncer
ii g campaign, it was mentioned in the Horald that he waa a
candidate as opposed to Mr. Dick, and on the 21st instant be
n-euid an address to the electors. (Hear, hoar.)
On tbe same day a meeting of the friends
of Alderman Sutherland was held, at wbicn it was resolved to
ple.ee tbat gentleman ia nomination, and it was announced that
he had contented to stand. (Hear, bcur.) Mr. Sutherland woald
bear bim out when be (Mr. Hart) Bald that very great infiuenoe
bad been brought to bear upon bim (Sir. Sutherland) to induce
him to retire fram the contest in his (Mr, Hart'«) favour, but
without effect. Hi (Mr. Hart) confesaed that he was a little
headstrong, tco, and that, having once entered the fie d, ho did
net like to retire ; but the public interests were of greater concern
than his (Mr. nun's) private fcolings. On nearly all public
matters, BO far as ho understood, ibeie waa a uulty
of sentiment between Mr. Sutherland and himself;
and flnalng that a third candidate was about to
be brought lol ward in tbe conactvatlve Interest, he (Mr. Hart)
made up hiß mind to retire. (L ud cheers.) As to the other
matter, which bad principally brought him there, be would pre-
mise by stating that tbe charge brought against him was that he
(Mr. Hart) was afraid to meet the electors at Uedfern, to many
of whom be owed money. Tbe individual wbo made tbla étale-
ment further stated thai he bad met him (Mr. Hirt) ia Elizabeth
sticet tbe day of the meeting, and told him tbat if Co had not the
money with him he would meet with a reception that would
not be either flattering or agreeable. He (Mr. Hart) wished
that Smith waa there present to confront bim, for be could assure
the electors that the etory of meeting him WJB a
¡uro invention, and that a more gratuitous falsehood
-waa never uttered. (Sensation.) He (Mr. Hart) bad not
teen Smith lor several UIUÜIUB, and then it was with reference to
a prc-miieory cole given to the Empire fund, which he had. to eue
him upon. Ptreonally he (Mr. Hun) never bad any dealings
with bmith, and certainly never owed bim or any other person a
shilling which be was tot both able and willing to pay. It was
vat quite true tbat Smith might bave been deluded into giving a
promissory note which ho thought he would not bo called upon
tu pay; but he (Mr. Hart) had only performed a legal duty in
cnlorcicg payment. (Cheers,) Mr Hurt said he bail no objec-
tion to any man being attacked for his political incompetenoy,
but be thought It »as unfair and degrading to the doctors to in-
troduce private mattera for the sako uf gralifying personal
animcuty. (Hear, hear ) After some further obiervatlon«, as
to the duty of electing proper representatives at this important
erins, Mr. Hart eat down amid loud cheers.
Mr. SUTHEBLAXI) said tbat at the ouieet of the contest he fore-
saw that tbe earrie subject which had oecn made use of at Sir
Daniel Cooper's election would be brought forward this dmo, and
he therefore made some remarks dtprtcuing any such conduct,
and whoever did BO in futnre would be no friend of bia. Ho
fully bore oat the statement or Mr. Hart aa to tbeir coming into
the field at the Burne time, and said be bad been offered if ho
v. iibdrew in his faveur, to be put in for Weat Sydney free of ex-
pense. (Hear, bear.) He extremely regretted that he bad been
Of posed to his friend, Mr. Hart, who had always acted and voted
cinthuently, and had he been seoncr in the field he
(Mr. buthc-rlund) would have been glad to hava
avoided the responsibilities which weuld devoirs
upon bim, but having once placed himself in the
banda of the electora, be thonght it was'hia duty to Bland by them.
He hoped, however, that Mr. Hart wonld bo successful in the
coDtlliufney te waa about to s'and for. (Cheers.)
Mr. NEWMAN B»id he deemed it his duty to make a few observa-
nt na. Fowas exceeditgly sorry that any each statements; had
ever been mude. He had known Mr. Hart from a child. From
bia position be waa a pretty good judge as to wbo were good
marks, ar.il who wera cot, and he could Bafcly say
that ho never called upon Ur. Hart f.r payment
of an uccount which was not promptly met. (Hear, hear.) Mr.
Newman then nrged upon tho eleotora not to relax their efforts,
for tbiy might yet rind unoiher in the field.
Mr. \Vo.D8 made some observations lo the same effect. Mr.
Burl, he auld, waa a sound and consistent politician, but they were
tetter acquslnttd with Mr. Sutherland, who had lived amongst
tbem for year». He felt it bia duty to Mr. Smith to Bay tbut
when be alluded to Mr. Hatt he stated that the money was due
with reference to the Empire and not out of any private trans
actlors of Mr. Hart.
The usual vote of lhanka waa tben given to the chairman, and a

(From the Clarence and Richmond Examiner)
A PUBLIC meeting, called by the Mayor, in compliance
with a requisition presented to him by rate-payers, was
held on Thursday evening last, at the School of Arts. The
Mayor (Mr W. Archer) occupied the chair, and opened
the proceedings by reading the advertisement convening the
meeting. He stated that the Council was well alive to the
importance of keeping the water out of the town, but for
want of funds was unable to undertake works of any
magnitude. He would now call upon Mr Laman to move
the first resolution.
Mr E. C. Laman said the late rains had shown them
that the town was liable to inundation, and property to
a great amount had been destroyed. There was
an old saying that "" three removes were as bad
as a fire.""' He believed one hasty removal
in time of floods was equal to the three. He now begged
to move the first resolution :-"" That town's meeting deplores
the inconvenience and danger to which Grafton is subjected
in consequence of this overflow of the river into the town
following the floods of the Clarence; and feels it to be a
matter of the greatest importance to use every means to
prevent any recurrence of the same."" Mr F. Vindin  
seconded the resolution. Mr W. A. B. Greaves, J.P.,
moved the second resolution. He stated that he appeared
there that evening apart from any official capacity, but as
a citizen and a sufferer by the late floods. During his stay
in this district he had witnessed three floods,
which had caused more or less devastation. It  
behoved them all to take up so important a matter. He
would read the resolution contracted to him :- "" That in
consequence of the disastrous occurrences of the late flood,
it is desirable that the Government should be memorialized,
in order that a survey of the inlets of the floods, and the
necessary levels should be made as to the best method of
keeping out the same; as this meeting has been informed
that dams and floodgates in a few places, would keep out of
the town all ordinary floods, and materially mitigate ex-
traordinary ones."" Mr A. Lardner, J.P., seconded the
motion.
Mr S. Avery moved the next resolution, as follows :
"" That, as a sum of about £10,000 has been paid by Grafton
to the general revenue for town lands, a considerable portion
of which is liable to be flooded to the depth of ten to twelve
feet, this meeting would urge upon the Government the
necessity of placing on the Estimates such a sum as will
effectually prevent the recurrence of a disaster similar to
that which the town and vicinity are now suffering.""
Mr T. Fisher seconded the resolution. The meeting
had been informed what they might expect in times of
heavy rains if something was not done. What works
were required to be done to effectually keep out the water
must be undertaken bv the Government ; and we ought to
endeavour to get a practical man at once to inspect the place.
Mr H. Cuthbert moved the fourth resolution;- ""That a
memorial, embodying the foregoing resolutions be pre-
pared, and signatures obtained, and that the following gen-  
tlemen, with power to add to their number, form a com-
ittee for the purpose, viz , the Mayor, Messrs A Lardner,
J. P , S. Avery, F. Vindin, J. P. Coles, E. C. Laman, T.
Fisher, A. Aitchins, A. Hyde, T. Peberdy, E. Potts, and
J. Page.""
Mr A. Hyde seconded the motion.    
Mr H. P. Coles asked what steps would be taken to
furnish the Government with some data ?
Mr W. A. B. Greaves, J.P., said the Government
would, upon receipt of the petition, order a survey, and
upon the report sent in would depend, in a great measure,
whether the Government would place the necessary sum
upon the estimates.
Alderman Payne proposed a vote of thanks to the chair-
man, which was duly acknowledged by his worship.
The meeting, which was very unanimous throughout,
then dispersed.
The following is the petition:
To his Excellency the Administrator of the Government and the
Executive Council of New South Wales.
The memorial of the undersigned inhabitants of the town of
Grafton humbly showeth, -
1. That Grafton is the principal town and port of the Clarence -
the seat of the public Institutions- the head quarters of the civil
and criminal business of the district, and the channel through
which nearly the whole of the commercial affairs of the important
districts of New England, the Clarence, and its gold-fields, are
transected with Sydney ; all the main roads of the district (with
one exception) radiating from thence to Armidale and Maitland
to the south, New England, Tenterfield, and the gold-fields on the
west, to the Richmond River and Queensland on the north.
2. That the town of Grafton, although of recent origin, contains
a population of nearly 1,300 souls. It has contributed about
£10,000 to the general revenue of the colony, from the sale of
town lands alone. The rateable property within its boundary
has been valued at £34,680 for the present year by the municipal
council, for the purposes of local taxation ; and it is the centre of
a large and rapidly increasing agricultural interest.
3. That the site of the town, and for several miles around it, is
a slightly undulating flat, varying from about ten to twenty-three
feet above the tide level of the Clarence River (which runs
through the town) and that the inhabitants are completely shut
out from access to high land, or any place of security in time of
floods, except by boats.
4. That within the short space of four years, Grafton has been
visitedd by three heavy floods, rising from eighteen to twenty-one
feet (being within two or three feet of the level of the highest
land within several miles on one occasion), covering a large pro-
portion of the town lands with water to a depth of from one to
twelve feet - causing much destruction of property, and great
inconvenience to the inhabitants - the loss of two lives in one of
the principal streets -putting almost a complete stop to business
for a considerable time - and leavingg stagnant water over a large
area (sometimes for months together), not only rendering the
streets impassable, but also engendering malaria and disease,
which, as the place becomes populous, must be most prejudicial
to the health of the inhabitants.
5. That this place has hitherto been flooded principally from
some inlets of the river situated below the town, and consequently
it has not risen so high as it must have done had it come in from
a higher level, and your memorialists contemplate with alarm, the
possibility - nay, probability - that some future floods may break
in above the town, in which case the entire place must inevitably
lie submerged, and a fearful destruction of life and property
ensue.
6. That the inhabitants of Grafton, although few in number,
were amongst the first to avail themselves of the Municipal Act,
and have hitherto paid the highest rate of taxation allowed by
law, for the improvement of their town, but that their resources
are totally inadequate to carry out the extensive works which
would be necessary, to insure the safety of the inhabitants from
floods.
7. Feeling assured from our personal observations, that ordinary
floods may be kept out of the town altogether - and that the ill-
effects of extraordinary visitations of the kind might be much
mitigated - if not entirely prevented ; your memorialists earnestly
solicit the favourable consideration of your Excellency and the
Executive Council to their prayer, viz., ""That a competent officer
may be instructed to make a survey and report upon the best
means to be adopted for keeping the floods from overflowing the
town of Grafton, and preventing breaches from occurring in the
river banks above the township; and, further, that a sum of
money may be placed upon the estimates of the next session of
Parliament, to perform such works as may be found necessary to
effect the object in view.""
And your memorialists, as is duty bound, will ever pray.
Grafton, May 14th.
Declaration of the Cambridge Tuiros.-There
is a strange tale that au Arabic Professor was in
.\ariably missing -whenever a real live Arab was to
visit the University, and conversation was expected ;
hut far stranger things than that may be found among
the legends of the tripos. Lovers, of such lore can
recount how one senior WTangler nearly cleared his
japeiB; and how another to make up for his lack of
pace, began the stifiest papers at Üie stiftest end, and
very nearly got beaten for ""his daring. How, again,
the sixteenth wrangler in a bad year beat the senior
in c1 eve» y one else in a paper of problems ; and how
n man, who might have easily been second, got bo
disgusted without reason at the whole thine, that he
fled and hid himself for «ie last two days of the six,
and was ninth wrangler after all. Great, too, ate
the achievements of "" cram,"" administered by a
judidous~tutbr,' even at the'eleventh hour. One smart
-lellow went in with barely a Senior Optime*» know-
ledge, but he warmed as he went on, and his Mentor
guessed nine pieces of book-work, which might be
set, over night, with such weird-like sagacity, that
he almost pushed his -way into the -wranglers.
| Another, whose chances of getting through at all were
I doubtful, got up, as a last desperate «source, Sturm's
I Theorem, and wrote it out so accurately from sheer
memory, without the most earthly notion of what it
meant, that he made, on the astonished examiner's
own confession, at least ten places. The list of the
.-poll, in days when Denman considered tne captaincy
of it quite as great an honour as the head of the
Clatsic Tripos, was merely handed over to a news-
paper to print ; and feaTful was the fight of the
luture curates, squires, and lawyers to force their way
up the passage to the little window, from which the
» aitor at intervals doled out little scraps of information
as to their fate. Still, the nish of rushes in the acade
jnic year is when, at nine o'clock on the last Friday In
January, the procter's men fix up the honour list, and
throw back the Senate House portals. Town and'
gown mingle quite harmoniously in that last fearful
quarter of an hour, and so far forget their fifth of
November feuds, as to lay peaceful bets. Moderators'
and examiners flit about, conscious of the great secret,
which they alone carry in their breasts, and fence
tmilingly w ith all leading questions. Men who are
certain to get high honours do not think it delicate
to ling« in sight, but trust to gome swift-footed
friend to bring them the news, and wait for it in their
rooms, or some handier trysting place. Year after
year, db they have counted [the minutes from nine,'
and at last espied their messenger coming across the
Quadrangle at only Bullen foot's-pace, they have had
to make up their minds to prepare for
adversity. Even the senior wrangler himself is
often not one tithe a» uplifted as his college dons or
his gyp. It is a pleasant thought that both .the
county papers will merge politics next week, and
unite in tpeaking of "" tho distinguished honours
which have been recently conferred by his Alma Mater
on the sen of our much-respected townsman,"" &c j
and that the papers of the adiacent counties wail
quote the paragraph at length' ; but he knows, to. his

nun in general, and ho ought to know more nbout
I art than Mr Cowper shoAved that he knew when he
gave his judgment on Mr Scott s column
As is always the case willi Baron Marochetti's
works, the Times of the occosiou-it was last Novem-
ber-inaugurated the Corur de Lion in Palace-yard
with a perfect bray of trumpets. We say ""bray,""
because no other word -will give the double effect
the salutation of the artist ana the voice of the critic.
Baron Marochetti was congratulated that he had pro-
duced a statue the excellence of which chiefly con-
sisted in impossible armour, and in features the main
credit of which was that they were unlike what is
known to be an authentic portrait of the
Lion-hearted King. We do 'not say that
the artist was bound to copy with servility
the features of the historical effigy. There
is a mythical element in the subject adverse to cold
copyUm. But when all the ideal was before him,
what the sculptor has achieved in the features of
Richard is only that tame prcttiness which may be
seen in its perfection at Baker-street. The ïalace
yard Creur de Lion as much and as little reproduces
the mighty man of valour who thundered charging
across the plains of Ascalon, or tho Xoir Faineant of
Scott, the assailant of Torquilstone, as Madame
Tussaud's series of Plantagenets worthily represent
those whose effigies are in the Royal Abboy of
Westminster. As to the armour of Richard, it is
a flat and total falsehood. It is not the armour
of Richard at all, and, if it were, human
muscles, even as exaggerated as a Crusader's biceps,
are not as perceptible through the chain mail as
through the flannel shirts of the Oxford eight. Chain
mail really was not worn .next to the skin ; and if
Baron Marochetti had gone to any higher authority
for regal and military costume than that afforded in
the theatrical prints most familiar to schoolboys, he
would have learned that when kings went forth to
battle in old time with the Saracen they did not go,
for all practical purposes, naked. We do not say
that the statue is other than lively, picturesque, ana
spirited ; only the action is theatrical, the details
chronologically false, and the anatomy doubtful while
ambitious. But graver faults remain behind. The
horse, besides being an historical impossibility, is no
more fit to carry a Norman knight in complete
armour, than the winner of the Derby is to
drag coal waggons up the slopes of the
Adelphi. The most that can be said for it is
the equivocal compliment of the Times, that the
artist did not feel himself fettered hy these things.
An artist who is congratulated on being superior to
truth in feature and costume may well be pardoned
if he supersedes the destrier of history by the trained
caracoller of Batty's circus; but when we are invited
to fall down and worship the only great equestrian
work of modern times, we cannot forget the really
statuesque dignity and majesty of Le Sueur's Charles
I. at Charing Cross, winch we pass on our way to
Palace Yard, and the sublimity to which even a
theatrical sentiment can rise in Falconnet's Peter the
Great. 'Sot, in our recognition of the merits of a
foreign artist, are we to forget that England has pro-
duced, in Foley's Lord Hardinge, an equestriin
statue which has so captivated the judgment of all
artistdom as to stimulate a subscription,
hitherto confined to artists, for another cast of it
to be erected in London. But we must ask, after all,
do the spirit, and liveliness, and action which are so
conspicuous in the Cour de Lion constitute a merit ?
Ought not monumental sculpture to avoid such vio-
lent and excited gesture, and an action which, as in
this case, can be but instantaneous : A transient
emotion, however successfully caught, interferes with
that lepóse and dignity and majesty which ought to
characterise at least monumental art, and the sharp
lines and contracted angles of Marochetti may well be
compared with the easy flowing lines and the solid
life of those equestrian statues of Verocchio and
Donaiello which -we can happily study at Sydenham.
A pretty and sentimental cleverness we do not deny
to the hero of Palace-yard ; but what would be
tolerable in bisque or ""Parian"" becomes only preten-
tious in feebleness and extravagant in weakness when
produced on a plusquam heroic size, and ia a material
which aims at eternity. The horse, as a good copy of
a horse, is very Rood ; and we may say the same of
the horses of Wyatt, especially that of George III,
in Cockspur-street, of Foley, and even of Chantrey.
Not one of our modern equestrian statues fails to
exhibit first-rate naturalistic treatment of the horse ;
and Marochetti's is among the best. But a very grave
questisn arises, whether the horse, in a heroic croup,
should not be conventionalised. The horses in the
Elgin marbles are not naturalistic ; they are ideal, and
are allusive and suggestive rather thin mere tran-
scripts from the riding-school. To take an instance
from parallel statues already alluded to, the
mystical creature -which is ridden by Dannrcker's
Ariadne is ten times more artistic than the excellent
felt's leo which is to be seen in Bell's Una. The so
called Farcese Bull in the antique Dirce would not
get a prize at a cattle show ; and we own to same
misgivings about the lions tor Nelson's monu acnt,
which we are expecting, and likely to expect, from
Sir E. Landseer. We have not space for the argu-
ment ; but the question is a most important one._
Very high art, especially in a material capable of
form and literal truth, should forego the advan-
tages of di rect representation. The nice little Parian
vases of the day which reproduce most delicitely the
fuchsia and the convolvulus, are very low in the seile
as compared with the conventionalised Greek acan-
thus and laurel. What the sculptor has to do is to
refine, to idealise, to exalt, to suggest-not
to reproduce, nor, except moderatily, to
imitate nature, especially the inferior ntture
of animal and vegetable life. In an equestrian
group the horse ought to be subordinated
to the hero ; but the horse is subordinated ia the
hnids of our modern artists, ana cannot be subordi-
nated unless it is conventionalised.

ties for tho exercise of the highest efforts of glyotie

raneous history to the capacities of British art the
classicists anti meduev alista meet in a contest from
which no great amount of credit accrues to either
Mr. Bell ia unquestionnblv a sculptor of great
technical and mechanical skill, and with
considerable gifts of execution, and even of
elegant sentiment Hu well-known ""Dorothea"" is
almost moro than pretty , his "" Eagle Slayer"" has
vigour, and his "" Una and the Lion"" contrasts
ina ourablj, in delicacy and sentiment, with the more
famous vet eensuous ""Ariadne"" of Dannn_kcr But
in the Waterloo place memorial there is absolutely
nothing to redeem its poverty of thought and inven-
tion btyend the successful but Bomcwhnt servile
imitation of the pouches and boots, the buckles, and
straps, and bearskins of three very literal and
prosaic pnv Ates of the G úntela In the way of design,

but this is soiretlung worse than common-
place, bcenuso it pretends to be better Mr, |
Bell, in his permanent bronze, only exhibits the
timid and incapable ambition which nos through
out chatactcrised this unlucky monument, and
which, öfter trying a do/en antithetical inscriptions,
has füllen back upon an extract from the "" nominal
return of the London Gazette, * and after many
attempts at recondite symbolism in the shape of
crossed bayonets, has ended in sheer blankncss,

lho real and ideal scarcclv kiss each other in this
composition Honour in her flowing raiment, de-
scending from the world of spirits, would
have suggested something less terrestrial
than the practical greatcoats and thick
tolcil boots of Brown, Jones, and Robinson,

tells as much of Waterloo as of Inkermann Mr
Bell, perhaps, had nothing to tell, and-we speak
after the manner of the In li-what nothing there»
to tell is badi) told Mr Scott's meduval shaft at
Dcnn's-yarel has its precedent in Italian Gothic,
but Italian Gothic, in this particular, only preserved
an architectural solecism which was originated in the
dcgincrate age of Roman art Ihe column, supporting
a statue-of which that of Trojan is the most familiar
and which has been so often repeated in modern
times-was unknown to Hellenic art, and the dis-
proportion between the mightv8haft and the insignifi-
cant image perched up aloft has always been
reproboted by pure taste In the AVestmmster
Mcmonol, the small si7e of the monument prevents
the St George from being insigniticmt in proportion
to the column , but ihe whole composition is on too
small a seale, and is sadly dwarfed by the Abbey,
besides being rather topheav) In many respects,
too much praise csnnot be given to the execution
Ihe contrast of colour is good, and the group of
statues is carved with great spirit and refinement
Even the shaft, with its vigorous cable moulding, dis-
play s a thoughtful eclecticism , but, after acquaint-
ance with Donatello s St George, we cannot recon-
cile ouiselvcs to a dismounted Patron of Eígland,
still less to so very tame and innocuous a dragon
destined, by the way, nea er to be struck by that
uplifted sword, by which he is scarce]) attacked,
W e see no reason whateoer why the Greek prac-
tice of heightening statues by metal accessories
should not be adopted b) the Gothic carvers, and we
should have liked a bronze sword But when the
whole composition is enlivened by heraldic colour on
the shields, it will at least pass muster, though it will
scarcely add to the reputation of any artist concerned
in it. We must, however, very strongly demur to the
ignorant criticism with which in theHouse of Com-
mons this monument has been assailed. A Colonel
French, perpetual chairman of the Kitchen Com
rnittee; thinking that taste m soups naturally implies
taste m art, asked whether the Government did not
intend to remove that disgraceful sclecism-a Gothic
group on a Corinthian column In his reply Mr
Cowper seems to have admitted the justice of the
criticism, and announced that, had Mr Scott's
drawing been submitted to him, he would
not have sanctioned its execution Here is every
conceivable nonsense The column is no more Corin-
thian than Colonel French is Timoleoa, there is
authority in Venice, and elsewhere m Italy, for a
group or a statue upon a column , and if there were
not, the innovation is a very fair one, sfter the prece-
dent of Roman statues. Our objection is to the
classical precedent itself as being below the standard
of the purest Greek art , but a meducval column
with a group is quite as legitimate as aRoman column
with a group Anyhow-we say it with all respect
to Lord Palmerston, and to Mr. Cowper, whose taste
is so very like the noble Premi»r s-that of all the re-
cent monuments erected in London, the Westminster
Memorial is the only tolerable one
The last acquisition to the Valhalla of Trafalgar

actually knows how the human leg looks in entire
repose, standing at ease in a pair of lonç woollen
drawers Further than tnis, we have nothing to sat
except that at present Sir Henry looks
vert bilious, and of the regular yellow-jaundice and
liver complaint colour, which is an elegant allusion,
perhaps, to his Indian life and death, and that we
rather object to the vulgarity in which Messrs Behnes
and Bell, as well as Mr Adams in his Jenner, have
indulged in puttirg their addresses on their statues
Mr Behnes, in his Havelock, adventures on averv
moderate attempt at symbolism A diligent scrutiny
of the statue, parte post, may detect a bit of a trunk
of a palm-tree, by which the eloquent artist
is said to wish to typify the cutung short of the
hero's career There is just a little variety in the
pedestals of Napier and Havelock , and it is quite a
pretty problem to say which is the meanest and
ugliest. Tins last observation leads us to a final com-
plaint. So our artists know that the pedestal
is really part of the work, and thît
Phidias and the Greek school, and even
.he best Italian school, never neglected it
In Mr Bell s work, to be sure, we do not know
-which is pedestal and which is monument, and ia
the new Cour de Lion, a narrow slip va the leneth of
the pedestal is vacant for either a paltry bas-relief or
an inscription which noboay knows how to write
But what pedestals they aie ' The Cour de Lion
ought to have been lifted up at least twenty feet
higher, and even then the group would not hate
been in scale with the House of Lords and
Westminster Hall ¡The Trafalgar square pe-
destals, one and all, exhibit the sort of
high ait which a packing case maker could com-
pass And tv hue our new statues ao little to
redeem us from poverty of thought, our new pedestals
proclaim a poverty of resource and a mean parsimo-
nious cheapness in material and ornament, which is
as c iscreditable to our financial, as the other failure is
to our artistic character
Ihe Archbishop of Dublin tells of a horseman who,
having losthis way, made a complete circle When
the first round was finished, seeing the marks of a
horse's hoofs, and never dreaming they were those of
his own beast, he rejoiced and said, "" This, at least,
shows me that 1 am in some track'"" When the
second circuit was finished, the signs of travel were
double, and he said, "" Now, surely I am m a beaten
way ,"" and with the conclusión of every round tne
rxarks increased, till he was certain that he was in
some frequented thoroughfare, but all the while he
w es riding after his horse's tail, and deceived bj the
track of his own error. So it is with men who ride a
hobby.

Monday.
Before the Chief Commissioner.
M r Isaacs, of counsel for the offloial assignee, moved for
the coi. urination of the plans of distribution that had been
filed in the estates of Elias Moses and Benjamin Benjamin.
M r Milford, of counoil for Messrs A. Moses and Son, sub-
mitted that the debts of his clients should not havo been
dealt with by tho assignees as debts affecting the separate
oi tate of Moses, but a« debts affecting the joint estate The
debts proved by A Moses Son, and Co (£2985 £290 5s 5d,
£1119 13s 6d , and £700), wero provort against tho estate
of Elias Moeos (in terms, at least), and not against the
jcmt estate of Moses and Benjamin, but Mr Milford
argued, thoso debts ought to have been treated in the official
assignee's plane as debts of (what Mr Milford torraed)
"" the so-called firm "" of Mosos and Benjamin, inasmuch
sr he contended, all the assets of that alleged firm are in
reality the asset» of E. Moses alone, the evidonce showing
that there wbe in reality no partnership existing between
Elias Moses and Benjamin Benjamin , that the latter was
littlemore than a myth, and that thero wsb m truth no
joint estate, and no sequestration by Moses and by Benja-
min as partners Mr. Isaacs msistod that
there was a partnership, and a joint estate,
that tbo evidence established the partnership, and that the
sequestration bv Moses and the sequestration by Benjamin
lieught in the joint or partnership estate, which is epociQod
in tho petition and the sohedule filed by each, that Mr
M îlfoià'B clients cannot now be allowed to shift from ono
cstato to another the proofs they havo already made against
ibe estate of E Moses, that the distinction between the
joint or partnership cstato and the separate estatts of the
individual paitners baa been recognised and acted upon
throughout the progress of theso matters, very many
cicduors having proved against the joint estate and
ethersngninst the separato estates, that ot the meeting of
creditors held on the 22nd November, tho Chief Commis-
sioner gave directions which imply that thero is in Court a
joir.it (slate as distinguished from the separate estates ,
that tht creditors then present expressly assented to those
directions, and thero has boen no appeal against them, and
that, m point of fact, the evidence shows th it the moneys
in question were lent or became due from E Moses as an
individual, to Mr Milford's clients-, or one of thom , that
the firm of Moses and Benjamin had nothing to
do with them , that, therefore, the proofs which
they made against the estate of E. Moses wero properly
math , and that, therefore, the plans of distribution filed by
the official assignee ought not to be varied by treating those
proofs iib made against the estate of Moses and Benjamin
His Honor concurred in the views ot the official assignee's
ctunsel, end ovoiruled the objections with coats -but thot,o
costs not to include the tflicial assignee's costs of Thursday
last
In tbo estate of Crosby and Co , an adjourned spocial
meeting Insolvents having filed accounts whicu may

directed tho case to be struck out, with leave to ro-entor it
if neccEsary

Roddy, and of Thomas Audsley, wero postponed until this
day fortnight.
In the e&tate of John Moxon, a special mooting Mr.
Fnucett, of counsel for the Joint Stock Bank, examined in-
solvent as to the circumstances under which he executed
a conveyance of Bomo real property very Bhortly prior to tho
séquestration of his eBfato, and after actions oommenoed in
iho Braidwood Dlutnot Court and in the Supreme Court,
though the writ of the Supieme Court had not been served

obi rutter which earned for linn so favourable a repu-
tation at the Cape ol'Oeiod Hop-, under irresponsible
Government. Sir Charl s Darling studies well every

taking, not to eoy laborious, in tho di<chargo of the
duiiea of his high poadon ; hut, he ia strictly the
ce nstitutiontil Goveuier. White ho goes carefully
through the business tf the day, he doe-a not interfere
with it. Those »ho remember his vigorous adminis-

in i he head of the Victorian Constitution the whilom

Now that Parliament is not sitting, "" the potplo""
are lnokit g about for quistiona with which to agiiate
the public mind, lhere is some attempt to revive
the land agitation, but "" the land "" ha* lost all attrac-
tion ior ihe crowd, who are beginning ter see that all
the i rude schemes which promiicd so well havo per
f, mied so little. Ihe we rking classes and the Upper
Home have coalesced, and both cry out
for b return to the auction 6ys'.em. The
rnt'-cor.vici pgiwion will be more general and
thoroughly hearty. But for the admirable
efficiency of r.iir police foice, maintained in spite nf
the c. i.tinu.d inte-iferenco of Fra/ir ard men of his
stamp, the- thinly po; ulaied gold distiicts would be
too much at the mercy of the old hands settled
amongst ns. The daily records of our police courts ,
aflord evidence of the wonderfully judiciouB and uti- '
obtrusive way in which the police force of th-s colony
csriy out their important duties. Hie people of all
rank« and classes are ns one against the introduction
to mj part of the Australian continent of the outcasts
of Bri tub society
The difftrenccB avhich have so long prevailed
